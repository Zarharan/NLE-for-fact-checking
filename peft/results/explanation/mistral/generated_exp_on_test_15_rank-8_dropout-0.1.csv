The chart, created by the website Information is Beautiful, is based on a study by China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention and a website called Statistica. However, the chart does not provide links to the reports. It is important to note that the percentage of mild cases does not necessarily indicate the likelihood of surviving the virus, as mortality rates vary depending on age and health.

In February, a study conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology reported that 70% of confirmed coronavirus cases were ""normal,"" 25.5% were ""severe,"" and 4.5% were ""light."" The director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, stated that more than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated on their website that the complete clinical picture of COVID-19 is not fully known. However, they cited a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which found that ""most cases"" are mild. The study analyzed medical records for coronavirus patients and categorized 84% of cases as non-severe. Age and baseline health were identified as factors in the severity of the illness.

While the chart claims that 80.9% of cases are mild, it is important to consider that different age groups may experience varying levels of severity. However, studies published by the World Health Organization and the CDC indicate that mild cases account for approximately 75-80% of cases. Overall, the statement in the chart is mostly accurate but may require additional clarification or information.

1,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Senator Tom Coburn that under President Obama, all healthcare in the country will eventually be run by the government. The article states that this claim is incorrect and rates it as false. It explains that while Obama's plan does seek to expand the private healthcare system to cover the uninsured, it does not propose a government-run healthcare system. The plan aims to increase eligibility for programs like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, create insurance pools for individuals to buy cheaper insurance, and implement strategies to reduce costs such as electronic medical records and preventive care. Obama himself has stated that if people have insurance and doctors they like, they should be able to keep them and just pay less for care. The article acknowledges that Obama's plan would result in closer regulation of the healthcare system, with provisions to cover pre-existing conditions and require more transparency from health insurance companies. It also calls for evidence-based healthcare standards to ensure that government programs like Medicare only pay for treatments that yield good results. However, the article emphasizes that Obama's plan is different from European-style health systems where the government owns clinics and employs doctors. The article concludes that while Coburn may have his own opinion on the likely consequences of Obama's plan, it is incorrect to suggest that Obama is promoting a government-run healthcare system.

2,"### Context: Local officials in Texas have dismissed reports of vote switching as voter error and have found no evidence of widespread election fraud. Rumors of voting machines automatically switching votes for Donald Trump to votes for Hillary Clinton began circulating on social media when early voting opened in Texas. However, officials at the Randall County Elections Office and Potter County Judge Nancy Tanner have attributed these reports to user error, stating that voters may accidentally select a different party. Tanner described one incident in Randall County where a voter's straight ticket vote flipped parties, but the machine was found to be functioning properly. Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos, a Republican, also rejected claims of widespread voter fraud, stating that it is highly unlikely in the state due to the numerous protocols in place at local offices where votes are counted. Cascos acknowledged that voter fraud does occur but is uncertain about its frequency and significance. In conclusion, while there were a few reports of vote flipping in Texas, local officials attribute them to voter error rather than rigged voting machines. There is no substantial evidence to support the claim of widespread vote switching or fraud in Texas.

3,"### Context: The claim that Hillary Clinton was gravely injured in a plane crash during a secret mission to Iran in 2012 is false. The claim originated from a fabricated article published by the conspiracy-mongering website WhatDoesItMean.com in 2012. The article falsely stated that Clinton had been injured and a top US Navy Seal Commander had been killed in a plane crash in Iran. The article was later reprinted by the European Union Times website, gaining some traction among US military personnel and Department of State staffers.

The fake article was included in the archive of 30,322 emails sent to and from Hillary Clinton's private email server while she was Secretary of State, which were released by WikiLeaks in 2016. After Clinton collapsed at a 9/11 memorial service in 2016, rumors about her health resurfaced, and fringe political sites picked up on the fake article, claiming that it proved Clinton was covering up a serious plane crash injury. However, the article was a complete fabrication and had no basis in reality.

The original fake news piece claimed that Clinton was on a secret mission and traveling with members of SEAL Team 4 when the plane crash occurred. It also falsely stated that Commander Job W. Price, who had actually died by suicide in Afghanistan, was killed in the crash. The article's contents were solely based on the fabricated claims of WhatDoesItMean.com, a website known for publishing sensational and unreliable conspiracy theories.

In summary, the claim that Hillary Clinton was gravely injured in a plane crash during a secret mission to Iran in 2012 is false. The claim originated from a fabricated article published by a conspiracy-mongering website and gained traction when it was included in the release of Clinton's emails by WikiLeaks.

4,"### Context: The article discusses a potential new drug for AIDS derived from a Chinese herb called syzigium claviforum. The drug, called bevirimat, is currently being tested in clinical trials and is at least three years away from being on the market. The article mentions that the drug has generated excitement among researchers and has a great safety profile, but does not provide any hard data to support these claims. The potential side effects of the drug and its impact on survival or quality of life are not discussed in the article. The possibility of negative interactions with other HIV drugs or co-existing medical conditions is also not mentioned. The article notes that the drug would be taken in combination with current antiretroviral therapies and places it in the context of other drugs that interrupt HIV replication. The article also mentions that bevirimat is a novel treatment and discusses how it may improve current treatment regimens. The prevalence and incidence of HIV in America are provided in the article, but the global prevalence of HIV is under-reported. The article questions whether the therapy would be made available to millions of people infected with HIV in developing countries if it is approved. The article includes perspectives from researchers and physicians who work with HIV/AIDS therapies, some of whom are paid consultants for the pharmaceutical company developing bevirimat. The article concludes with a quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, providing some balance. Overall, the article lacks hard data and does not provide information on the potential cost of the drug or its efficacy and safety.
Claim: Chinese herb may yield drug for AIDS
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story is about bevirimat, a new drug for late stage HIV. While there is interesting background on the current stage of HIV/AIDS drug development in the story, it has several important flaws. The story provides no evidence on the safety or efficacy of this drug, despite the drug company president’s comments that bevirimat “. . .looks potent and has a great safety profile”. What is the evidence? The story does not discuss the potential side effects of this new drug, and it does not provide a caveat that the drug may not live up to its predicted effect in humans. The story mentions that this new drug would be taken in combination with current antiretroviral therapies. But there is no discussion of any possible negative interaction(s) with other HIV drugs, or with drugs for co-existing medical conditions. Researchers and physicians who work with HIV/AIDS therapies are cited to provide perspective on this potential new treatment in the context of current therapies. Sources who are also paid consultants for Panacos Pharmaceuticals are appropriately noted. Some appropriate attempt at balance is provided by the concluding quote from Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. There is one error in the article: “People who started AIDS therapy in 2003 lived an estimated 13 years longer than people diagnosed with AIDS in 1988.” Presumably they meant that people starting treatment in 2003 are EXPECTED to live 13 yrs longer. The story provides appropriate prevalence and incidence data on Americans living with HIV. If anything, the story under-reports HIV prevalence worldwide. The story might have aked the question: If this therapy is approved, would it be made available to the millions infected with HIV in developing countries? Finally, the story does not provide any projections of what the drug might cost. But the story was able to estimate annual sales of the drug for Panacos Pharmaceuticals. If you can give the latter, you should be able to provide the former.",Chinese herb may yield drug for AIDS,This is a story about a new drug for AIDS that is currently in clinical trials.

5,"### Context: The Department of the Interior plans to conduct a lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by the end of the year, but environmental groups are prepared to challenge these plans in federal court and through public opinion. They argue that the environmental review was rushed, incomplete, and biased, and that it only presents a fraction of the long-term damage that will occur if drilling rigs are allowed in the wilderness area. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) defends its analysis, stating that it was developed with input from various stakeholders and that it is in line with the mandate received from Congress. The refuge, located in Alaska, was created in 1960 and expanded in 1980. While a significant portion of the refuge is designated as wilderness, Congress ordered a study of the coastal plain for natural resources. The coastal plain is an important habitat for pregnant polar bears and the Porcupine Caribou Herd. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the plain holds 10.4 billion barrels of oil. Drilling in the area is supported by Alaskan politicians due to the potential job creation, oil production, and revenue for the state. The lease sales provision was included in President Donald Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. The BLM spent a year on an environmental review, which environmental groups argue is flawed. They claim that the review fails to adequately consider the impacts on polar bears and greenhouse gas pollution. The groups have formed a coalition to protect the Arctic Refuge and have warned potential bidders of legal challenges and reputational damage if they participate in the lease sale. Environmental attorneys argue that there are many grounds for a lawsuit due to the deficiencies in the final environmental impact statement. The ultimate goal for these groups is to change the law that requires lease sales in the refuge. They also aim to hold oil companies, financial institutions, and insurance companies accountable for their involvement in bidding on the leases.

7,"### Context: Rio state Health Secretary Luiz Antonio Teixeira Junior has stated that there have been no recent urban cases of yellow fever in Rio and that the risk of contagion in touristic parts of the city is ""nearly zero."" He advised visitors to avoid forests, bushes, and waterfalls, as these are the areas where the mosquitoes that transmit the disease live. Brazil is currently vaccinating more than 20 million people against yellow fever in an effort to control the outbreak, with Rio state alone having vaccinated over 8 million people. The World Health Organization also recommends that visitors to Rio get vaccinated.

As of Tuesday, Brazil's Health Ministry has confirmed 213 cases of yellow fever across the country, with 81 deaths. This is fewer than the number of cases and deaths confirmed during the same period in the last outbreak, which was unusually large. Despite concerns from tourism agencies, Rio state Tourism Secretary Nilo Felix believes that the disease will not have a significant impact on tourism during the high season. He expects 1.5 million visitors in the city in the next couple of weeks, which is similar to the number of visitors in 2017.

James Story, the U.S. consul general in Rio, has not heard of any American concerns about yellow fever directly and believes that the outbreak will not affect tourism in the coming weeks. He stated that Carnival is an international festival with people from all over, and he is confident that this time will be no different. Alfredo Lopes, the head of Rio's hotel association, mentioned that there have been some concerns about yellow fever, but there have been few cancellations so far.

In summary, Rio state is urging Carnival visitors to stick to urban areas as there have been no recent urban cases of yellow fever and the risk of contagion in touristic parts of the city is low. The government is conducting a massive vaccination campaign, and the number of cases and deaths in the current outbreak is lower than in the previous outbreak. Officials and tourism representatives believe that the outbreak will not have a significant impact on tourism during the high season, and they expect a similar number of visitors as in the previous year.

While there was skepticism surrounding the authenticity of the images, the article provides reasons to believe that they are genuine. The condition depicted in the images is called ulnar dimelia, which is a rare congenital anomaly of the upper limb characterized by the duplication of the ulna, absence of the radius, and polydactyly. Ulnar dimelia is classified as the mirror-hand and falls under the third group of congenital hand malformation. The condition has been documented in several cases, including one by Dr. Rupesh Namdev in Bilaspur, India, where a seven-year-old girl had a similar condition with eight fingers on one hand. Radiographic images of the wrist joint showed polydactyly, duplication of the ulna, duplication of the ulnar side of carpal bones, metacarpals, and phalanges, absence of the radius, and absence of the thumb. The images of the hand with eight fingers can also be found on Radiopaedia.org and the National Center for Biotechnology Information.

9,"### Context: The Taal volcano near Manila, Philippines erupted on Sunday, causing clouds of ash to reach the capital city and forcing the shutdown of the main airport. Over 500 flights were canceled, but the airport partially reopened on Monday after the ashfall eased. There were no immediate reports of deaths or major damage directly caused by the eruption, but a truck accident in Laguna province resulted in the death of the driver and injuries to three others, possibly due to slippery conditions caused by the ash. More than 30,000 villagers in Batangas and Cavite provinces fled their homes, and officials expected the number to increase. Some residents were unable to leave due to a lack of transportation and poor visibility, while others refused to evacuate to protect their livelihoods. The mayor of Balete town appealed for troops and police to prevent people from returning to their villages. The main airport was partially reopened and President Rodrigo Duterte's aircraft was able to land in Manila on Monday. The Taal volcano erupted suddenly on Sunday, sending steam, ash, and pebbles up to 10 to 15 kilometers into the sky. The ash and steam column reached a height of 2 kilometers on Monday, with lava fountains spewing from the main crater and another vent north of it. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology raised the danger level around Taal to Level 4, indicating a hazardous eruption within hours to days was possible. The volcano's last major eruption occurred in 1965, resulting in over 200 deaths. Fishing villages on the small island where the volcano is located were evacuated, and there is a call for a total evacuation of endangered communities within a 14-kilometer radius of Taal. Government work and schools were suspended in several towns and cities, including Manila, due to health risks from the ash. Taal is one of about two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines, which is prone to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and typhoons.

10,"### Context: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has declared an ""unusual mortality event"" after a high number of dead dolphins have washed up on the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. About half of the dolphins found were newly born or stillborn calves. The death toll has now reached at least 82, which is significantly higher than the normal mortality rate for dolphins along the Gulf Coast at this time of year. While there are no outward signs of oil contamination, suspicions have arisen about the petrochemicals that polluted the Gulf waters after the BP drilling platform explosion in 2010.

Last year, scientists were already investigating the discovery of nearly 90 dead dolphins, mostly adults, when they became alarmed at the surge in dead baby dolphins found in January. Some experts speculate that oil ingested or inhaled by dolphins during the BP oil spill has had a delayed impact, possibly leading to dolphin miscarriages. This spike in deaths, particularly among premature infants, has occurred during the first dolphin calving season in the northern Gulf since the BP blowout.

Scientists at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama suggest that unusually cold water temperatures in the Gulf may be a contributing factor. Water temperatures abruptly dropped from the upper 50s to the 40s in January, just before the first two stillborn calves were found. A second wave of dolphin carcasses washed ashore after temperatures dipped again. However, NOAA officials dismiss the significance of cold weather, citing a similar cold snap in February 2010, months before the oil spill, which resulted in higher-than-normal mortality among various wildlife species.

Both sides of the argument agree that if frigid weather is to blame, the end of the die-off is likely as warmer temperatures return. However, NOAA experts anticipate that the number of deaths will increase further as the bottlenose dolphin calving season reaches full swing in the coming weeks. Typically, 2,000 to 5,000 dolphins in the region give birth during this time of year.
Claim: Scientists debate cause of dolphin deaths.

12,"### Context: The claim that ""Love bugs"" are the result of a genetic experiment gone wrong at the University of Florida is false. Love bugs, also known as the ""honeymoon fly,"" are a type of fly in the Bibionidae family that are a nuisance to motorists in Florida. They do not bite or sting, but their sheer numbers can be overwhelming. They splatter on windshields, lights, grills, and radiators of vehicles, and their dried remains can be difficult to remove. Suicidal pairs of love bugs have even caused overheating of motors when drawn into cooling systems.

Contrary to the claim, love bugs are not man-made or the result of a genetic experiment. They are native to Central America and arrived in the United States as undiscovered stowaways on ships that arrived in Galveston or New Orleans around 1920. They migrated into Florida in 1947 from Louisiana and decided to stay. Their natural capacity for reproduction led to their population explosion.

The claim that love bugs were created at the University of Florida by crossing a fly and a mosquito to combat the mosquito problem is also debunked. Love bugs do not eat mosquitoes, and they were not bio-engineered as a solution to the mosquito problem. The idea that the University of Florida's mad scientists created love bugs is dismissed by Philip Koehler, an endowed professor in UF's entomology department, who states that if they had created them, they would be orange and blue.

In conclusion, love bugs are not the result of a genetic experiment gone wrong at the University of Florida. They are a natural species of fly that migrated to the United States and settled in Florida. The claim of a genetic experiment is debunked by an entomology professor at the University of Florida.

13,"### Context: The claim that a judge ruled that girls in an Illinois school district ""must shower with boys"" and had no right to privacy is misleading and inaccurate. The article explains that the claim originated from a deceptive article published by The Cube News, which redirected readers to spammy pages. The article was copied and pasted from a right-leaning website called The College Fix.

The article oversimplified a complex legal dispute that lasted for six years in a Chicago-area high school district. It began when a transgender female student filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in 2013. The OCR concluded that the school had accommodated the student's gender identity in various ways but had denied her access to girls' locker rooms. In 2015, the school district and the OCR signed an agreement allowing the student to use the girls' locker rooms with privacy curtains installed.

In 2016, a group called ""Students and Parents for Privacy"" filed a lawsuit, claiming that the Department of Education had exceeded its authority by redefining sex discrimination to include gender identity. They also argued that the locker room policy violated their constitutional rights to bodily privacy and religious expression. The lawsuit included the Illinois Safe Schools Alliance and three other transgender students as intervenors.

In 2019, Judge Jorge Alonso ruled partly in favor of the motion to dismiss the claims against the school district. However, he did not rule that girls have no right to privacy or that they must shower with boys. The article misrepresents his ruling. Alonso recognized the constitutional privacy protections available to individuals but also established the limits of those privacy rights.

The claim that girls must shower with boys is flawed for several reasons. Firstly, the locker room policy applies to both transgender females and transgender males. Secondly, the transgender females in question identify and live as girls, and they are officially recognized as female students by the school district. Describing them as ""boys"" based solely on their birth-assigned sex is misleading. Lastly, Alonso's ruling did not come to a definitive conclusion about the gender-affirming locker room agreement.

In summary, the claim that a judge ruled that girls in an Illinois school district ""must shower with boys"" and had no right to privacy is inaccurate and misleading. The article it originated from was deceptive and copied from another website. The legal dispute involved a transgender student's access to locker rooms and included arguments about sex discrimination, constitutional rights, and religious expression. The judge's ruling did not support the claim made in the headline.

14,"### Context: Zambia's Health Minister, Chitalu Chilufya, has stated that there has been a significant reduction in the number of new cases in the cholera outbreak that has claimed over 70 lives since October, with most of the deaths occurring in the capital city, Lusaka. The government is implementing various preventive measures, including providing fresh water, educating the public on waste disposal and personal hygiene, and administering vaccinations. The World Health Organization (WHO) is assisting with the vaccination of Lusaka residents, with plans to vaccinate another one million people in cholera hotspots across the country later this year. The United States has provided chlorine drops to purify 120 million liters of water, and a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with local health officials in Zambia. Additionally, a medical team from Israel's Sheba Medical Center has been treating cholera victims at an emergency clinic in a Lusaka stadium.

Last week, the Zambian military was deployed to the densely populated Lusaka slum of Kanyama after residents rioted over the removal of market vendors, a measure aimed at improving hygiene. The military intervention was necessary as the police struggled to control the rioters who caused property damage and looted shops. The cholera outbreak has resulted in the closure of schools and the curtailment of public gatherings, although the government plans to ease these restrictions.

In response to the outbreak, Zambia's religious affairs minister declared a week of prayer and fasting to ""kick out cholera from the land."" However, some Zambians believe that this observance is a distraction from the alleged failures of the government to address issues such as the lack of public toilets in slums, inadequate garbage collection systems, and water shortages in Lusaka.

Cholera is caused by consuming contaminated food or water and can be fatal within hours if left untreated. The government and international organizations are working together to contain the outbreak and provide necessary assistance to affected areas.

16,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by U.S. Rep. Ted Poe that the medical device tax in the Obamacare law has led to the loss of thousands of jobs in the U.S. The tax is a 2.3 percent levy on the sale of most medical devices, excluding items like eyeglasses and bandages. The tax was implemented in 2013 as a way to offset the costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured.

Poe's claim is supported by news stories that cite examples of job cuts in the medical device industry attributed in part to the tax. For example, Smith & Nephew cut nearly 100 jobs in Memphis and Andover, Massachusetts, citing the tax as a reason. Kalamazoo-based Stryker expected to lay off about 1,000 employees worldwide, with the tax being named as one reason for the cuts. Welch Allyn announced 120 buyouts and layoffs in Central New York, also citing the tax as a reason. Boston Scientific increased planned job cuts by 900 to 1,000 positions, with the tax playing a role. Cook Medical Inc. halted plans to build five plants, citing the tax as a reason. Medtronic's CEO predicted that the tax would cost his company 1,000 jobs, and the company announced 1,000 cuts worldwide in 2012 and 2,000 cuts worldwide in 2013.

The article also mentions a study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) that predicted the tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, resulting in the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs. However, the study was deemed not credible by Bloomberg Government.

The article includes a statement from Brian Johnson of MassDevice.com, who says that it is difficult to determine if the tax alone was the cause of layoffs or if companies used the tax as a cover for layoffs that were already planned. He also mentions that the tax disproportionately harms young, innovative start-up companies and that the industry is skeptical of predictions that business will boom as more people join the healthcare system.

Overall, the article concludes that Poe's claim is partially accurate, as news stories indicate that more than 2,000 job cuts were planned or made partly because of the tax. However, it also highlights the difficulty in determining if the tax alone was the cause of layoffs and the context of the industry's concerns about the tax.

Trump claims that Israel profiles based on ethnicity and does it successfully. However, the article argues that Trump's claim is misleading. While Israel does practice both predictive profiling and ethnic profiling, it also has other security measures in place that are crucial to its success in deterring terrorism. Israeli security now considers a much more comprehensive and specific set of indicators to locate potential threats. The article also highlights that Israel's security infrastructure is much more comprehensive than just profiling. The vigilance of the Israeli public, the coordination and specialization of its intelligence gathering agencies, and the rigorous selection process for security officers are all factors that contribute to Israel's effective security. Additionally, the article points out that the United States does allow profiling based on race in security screenings, and it has attempted to adopt Israeli-style behavioral profiling in the past with limited success. The article concludes that while Israel does take ethnicity into consideration in its security screenings, profiling is not the sole reason for its success in deterring terrorism.

The town's Food Services Committee, consisting of parents, school officials, and town officials, is working to improve the menu and explore the possibility of outsourcing food production. The committee is considering the logistics and costs of implementing larger-scale changes. A petition created by a parent received almost 600 signatures in support of better food and sustainable, eco-friendly food wares. The school board has discussed the option of outsourcing food production to companies like No Fuss Lunch and Brigaid, with the latter proposing to consult with the district on introducing more on-site cooking. The committee is also drafting a healthier menu with the help of volunteer nutritionists and the Food Services Department. The call for waste reduction comes after the Environmental Committee of the Connecticut General Assembly voted in favor of legislation banning Styrofoam trays, which contain harmful elements.

Claim: FDA approves new psoriasis drug
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The US Food and Drug Administration just approved a new drug to treat psoriasis, a common skin condition that can form thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. Siliq (brodalumab) is mainly intended for patients who don’t respond to other forms of treatment, like anti-inflammatory topical medications and light therapies. The “last resort” recommendation may be due to the four completed suicides that took place during the clinical trial, leading the FDA to believe that Siliq may be correlated to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior — especially in patients with a history of depression. As a result, the FDA is requiring Siliq to be sold with a “boxed warning” (the strictest warning put in the labeling of prescription drugs) and only through a restricted program. The FDA news release devotes a significant chunk to the drug’s potential harms and makes clear who should or shouldn’t be taking Siliq. What’s mainly missing from the release are any numbers to give a sense of the scope of potential benefits and harms. Regarding the drug’s potential benefits, the release uses only vague, comparative wording (“more patients… had skin that was clear or almost clear.”). We don’t know how the participants were selected, how long they were followed up and how their improvement was assessed. Furthermore, a clinical trial was stopped for a period of time due to safety concerns, which was then continued by another drug manufacturer. Although not explicitly stated, it is fair to assume that drug manufacturers also funded these clinical trials. These are study limitations that were never disclosed by the news release. We did find a 90-page FDA briefing document online from 2016, which includes some efficacy data. Curiously, this document mentions five clinical trials instead of three. We’re not sure why the FDA release didn’t include the two other clinical trials that compared Siliq (brodalumab) to ustekinumab. We also reviewed TIME.com’s coverage of this new drug. Specialty drugs treating skin conditions like psoriasis can be expensive. The main competitors to Valeant’s Siliq may be Novartis’ Cosentyx and Eli Lilly’s Taltz — both of which cost at least $16,600 for one dose. Although some of this could be covered by insurance, patients could still be responsible for co-pays, which could amount to thousands of dollars. In addition, if patients have exhausted all existing treatment options and are desperate to clear up their psoriasis, they may be willing to try riskier therapies. If there is a new alternative that is FDA-approved and cost-effective, then it certainly deserves to be reported — as in this case, with strong caveats.",FDA approves new psoriasis drug,"This news release from the drug manufacturer Vyera Pharmaceuticals announces the FDA’s approval of a new drug for psoriasis, apremilast (marketed as Siliq). The news release does a good job of describing the potential harms of the drug, including an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. The release also mentions other side effects associated with the drug. However, the release doesn’t provide any information about the cost of the drug, and it doesn’t provide any numbers to help readers understand the magnitude of the benefits of the drug. The release also doesn’t provide any information about the quality of evidence in the trials, and it doesn’t disclose the funding sources for the clinical trials.

The news release also neglects to mention that the drug is a last-resort treatment option for patients who have not responded to other therapies. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the skin and joints. It is estimated to affect 125 million people worldwide. The disease is characterized by raised, red, scaly patches that can be itchy and painful. It can also cause joint pain and swelling. The disease is a lifelong condition that varies in severity. There is no cure for psoriasis, and treatment options include topical medications, phototherapy, systemic medications, and biologic agents.

20,"### Context: South Dakota recently launched a campaign to combat methamphetamine addiction with the tagline ""Meth. We're On It."" The state spent $449,000 on an advertising campaign promoting a treatment and education program. The slogan, although it received attention and some ridicule on social media, is a truncated version of a remark made by Governor Kristi Noem in a public service announcement. The campaign aims to address the growing meth crisis in the state, which is impacting every community and threatening the success of the next generation.

The initiative includes over $1 million in funding for meth addiction treatment services and more than $730,000 for school programs aimed at preventing addiction among students. While the tagline may have generated laughs, the seriousness of the drug's impact on the state cannot be ignored. In August 2019, state Corrections Secretary Mike Leidholt informed lawmakers that 83 percent of court admissions in South Dakota involved offenses related to controlled substances. Furthermore, 28 percent of male prisoners and 64 percent of female prisoners for drug-related offenses were involved with methamphetamines in some capacity, compared to national averages of 14 percent for males and 24 percent for females.

The article highlights the discrepancy between the humorous tagline and the severity of the methamphetamine problem in South Dakota. While the slogan may have attracted attention, it is crucial to recognize the urgent need for addressing addiction and providing support for those affected. The state's investment in treatment services and prevention programs demonstrates a commitment to tackling the issue.

In conclusion, South Dakota's campaign against methamphetamine addiction, with the tagline ""Meth. We're On It,"" has garnered attention and sparked discussions on social media. However, the seriousness of the state's meth crisis cannot be overlooked. The campaign includes significant funding for addiction treatment services and prevention programs in schools. The high percentage of drug-related offenses involving methamphetamines among prisoners in South Dakota emphasizes the urgency of addressing the issue.

23,"### Context: French physicist Serge Haroche and American physicist David Wineland have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in quantum physics. They have found ways to manipulate the smallest particles of matter and light to observe strange behavior that was previously only imagined in equations and thought experiments. Their achievements have been praised for bringing to life the wildest dreams of science fiction. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded them the prize, stated that their work has opened the door to a new era of experimentation with quantum physics. The hope is that quantum computers, which can conduct far more complicated calculations and hold vastly more data than classical computers, will change our everyday lives in the same radical way as classical computers did in the last century.

Haroche and Wineland have managed to measure and control very fragile quantum states, which were previously thought to be inaccessible for direct observation. They have developed ingenious laboratory methods that allow them to examine, control, and count individual quantum particles. Haroche uses electrons to control and measure photons, while Wineland uses photons to measure and control electrons. Their work has demonstrated the strange properties of quantum mechanics, such as particles acting as if they are simultaneously in two locations, known as a ""superposition.""

Wineland's ""parlour trick"" involves hitting an atom with laser light, which has a 50 percent chance of moving it, and observing the atom at two different locations. This experiment shows that particles can behave as if they are in more than one position at the same time. This is a key concept in quantum computing, where switches can be in multiple positions simultaneously, allowing for faster and more efficient calculations.

While both scientists work in the field of quantum optics, they have used opposite approaches to the same problem. Wineland uses light particles to measure and control particles of matter, while Haroche uses electrons to control and measure photons. Their work has demonstrated the direct observation of individual quantum particles without destroying them, which is crucial for the development of quantum computers.

Wineland and Haroche's achievements have been described as some of the most incredible experimental tests of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics. They have shown just how strange the quantum world really is and have opened up the potential for new technologies that were previously unimaginable.

26,"### Context: In 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker called a special session to introduce legislative initiatives aimed at creating jobs. Health care advocate Robert Kraig criticized some of the bills, claiming they curbed the rights of injured people to sue corporations for damages. Kraig specifically mentioned a bill proposed by Senator Rich Zipperer that would grant immunity to drug companies and medical device manufacturers from liability for injuries and deaths caused by their products, as long as they were approved by the FDA. However, the bill does have exceptions, such as if FDA approval was obtained through fraud or if the manufacturer failed to follow the approved design in the manufacturing process. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families, stated that the bill would likely apply to all drugs but may have less immunity for medical devices, depending on the interpretation of the word ""approved"" in the bill. Kraig initially admitted that his statement was overbroad and should have included the qualification that the bill only covers FDA-approved drugs and medical devices. However, he argued that the bill is still dangerous because the FDA's regulatory powers have been weakened in recent years, making its approval less protective. Kraig cited a report critical of a similar Michigan law that grants immunity to drug manufacturers and a national report on problems with FDA-approved drugs and medical devices as evidence. The fact-checker concludes that while Kraig's statement was overbroad, the bill does aim to grant immunity to drug and device manufacturers, with some exceptions.

28,"### Context: The claim that the Obama administration legalized bump stocks is false. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ruled multiple times between 2008 and 2017 that certain models of bump stocks could not be prohibited under existing gun laws. Bump stocks are devices that can be attached to a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot rapidly, simulating the firing speed of a fully automatic weapon. The legality of bump stocks depends on whether they meet the definition of a ""machinegun"" under federal firearm laws. The ATF determined that certain models of bump stocks did not meet this definition and therefore were not regulated as firearms. This ruling was made during both the Obama and Trump administrations. 

In response to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October 2017, where the shooter used rifles with bump stocks, President Trump directed the Department of Justice to propose a rule to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns. The proposed rule seeks to classify all bump stocks as federally banned weapons and would require those who possess, sell, or make bump stocks to destroy them or surrender them. However, the rule has not been finalized and is still open for public comment until June 27, 2018.

It is important to note that some bump stocks have been deemed illegal. The ATF ruled in 2006 that the Akins Accelerator, a specific type of bump stock, converted a weapon to shoot automatically and was therefore classified as a machinegun. However, devices like the Slide Fire stock, which require continuous multiple inputs by the user for each shot, were not classified as restricted firearms.

Gun rights groups and advocates argue that any final rule banning bump stocks could be challenged in court, as they believe that changing the definition of a machinegun can only be done by Congress. Senator Dianne Feinstein and other Democratic senators have introduced a bill to ban bump stocks and similar devices, but it has not yet received a vote.

In conclusion, the claim that the Obama administration legalized bump stocks is false. The ATF ruled that certain models of bump stocks were not regulated as firearms under existing gun laws, and this ruling was made during both the Obama and Trump administrations. The Trump administration has proposed a rule to ban all bump stocks, but the rule has not been finalized and is still open for public comment.

29,"### Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is spending $270 million on research projects to determine the risks of e-cigarettes before more Americans become hooked on them. However, the final results may not be available until 2018. The slow pace of science is contributing to a regulatory vacuum, allowing e-cigarette makers to sell their products virtually unchallenged. The e-cigarette industry argues that the FDA must wait for the results of the research before issuing any regulations, or manufacturers risk being driven out of business by unproven fears about their products. The FDA believes it will not take many years to create the regulatory framework once it has the basic authority to regulate e-cigarettes, which could happen next year. The missing science includes basic questions such as what compounds are in the vapor produced by e-cigarettes, whether flavors entice children to vape, and whether e-cigarettes will reduce the number of smokers or produce new nicotine addicts. The FDA began funding e-cigarette research in 2012. The FDA’s proposed e-cigarette rules would give it the power to regulate the ingredients in the vaping liquid, but are silent on the plumes of vapor produced when the liquid is heated. According to research at Virginia Commonwealth University, a form of e-cigarettes called tank systems can get so hot the vapor can contain the carcinogen formaldehyde and other toxic compounds. The FDA wants to know what’s in the emissions, not just the ingredients. The FDA is under pressure to get moving on regulations.

Tecfidera will be the third oral MS drug available in Europe and is likely to surpass sales of Novartis' Gilenya and Sanofi's Aubagio. In the United States, Tecfidera has consistently exceeded sales forecasts and is on track to make over $1 billion in sales in its first year on the market. The drug is also approved for sale in Canada and Australia. The introduction of Tecfidera in Europe will begin in the coming weeks, with a full roll-out expected over the next year as Biogen negotiates reimbursement on a country by country basis. Germany will be the first country to launch the drug. Tecfidera's prospects in Europe were uncertain due to concerns about protection against generic copies, but this issue was resolved in November when Biogen won 10 years of regulatory exclusivity. There are approximately 400,000 people in Europe with multiple sclerosis. Biogen declined to comment on the market share Tecfidera is likely to capture in Europe. Analysts forecast 2014 Tecfidera sales outside the United States to reach $291 million, and annual worldwide sales of the drug to reach $6 billion by 2019, with over a third of that coming from Europe and other non-U.S. markets.

31,"### Context: The article discusses the death of a 46-year-old Indonesian doctor from COVID-19 and highlights the challenges faced by healthcare workers in Indonesia during the pandemic. The country has the highest death toll in Asia after China, with 3,293 infections and 280 deaths. The deaths of 26 doctors and nine nurses have raised concerns about the country's healthcare system, which is ill-prepared to handle the crisis.

The article mentions that Indonesia was not well-prepared at the beginning of the outbreak and lacked personal protective equipment (PPE), leading to the deaths of many doctors. The government has asked industries to produce PPE locally, but the virus is spreading faster than the production of protective gear. Hospitals in Indonesia are also lacking beds, medical staff, and intensive care facilities.

President Joko Widodo has resisted strict lockdown measures and instead urged Indonesians to practice social distancing. However, the article suggests that the government needs to act quickly, especially in regions outside the capital, Jakarta, where there is a shortage of doctors and medical resources.

The article also highlights the personal story of the doctor who died, Purwarini, who was the first doctor in her family. She initially worked in human resources but started treating patients when the outbreak hit. Despite being moved to a hospital with a ventilator, she succumbed to the virus within a week.

The deaths of doctors and nurses have sparked calls for a lockdown from medical professionals in Indonesia. The article concludes with the devastated father of the deceased doctor expressing his grief and questioning the meaning of material possessions when his daughter has passed away.

Overall, the article emphasizes the challenges faced by healthcare workers in Indonesia, including a lack of preparedness, inadequate PPE, and a shortage of medical resources. It also highlights the need for urgent action from the government to contain the spread of the virus, especially in regions outside the capital.

32,"### Context: The claim that SUNY Binghamton is offering a ""Stop White People"" course is not accurate. The controversy began when an optional conference for Binghamton University Residential Assistants (RAs) titled ""#StopWhitePeople2K16"" was held. The conference aimed to facilitate a discussion on diversity, privilege, and society. The title of the conference garnered attention and led to concerns about racism.

Brian Rose, Binghamton University's Vice President of Student Affairs, responded to the controversy by stating that the program was not ""anti-white"" but rather a discussion exploring topics such as reverse racism, the relationship between communities of color and police, whiteness, crime, and segregation. Rose explained that the title of the conference was drawn from a popular Twitter hashtag and was not invented by the program facilitators. He also mentioned that the program was student-led and supported by a young professional staff person.

The university's student-affairs office reviewed the session and confirmed that the program content was not ""anti-white."" The discussion during the conference was student-driven and described as respectful and productive. The university aims to cultivate an environment where students listen to and learn from each other without causing harm.

Despite rumors spreading on social media that Binghamton was offering a full course called ""Stop White People,"" the university's media relations department clarified that the RA-only presentation was student-led and managed. Binghamton has never offered a ""Stop White People"" class as part of its curriculum.

In summary, the controversy arose from an optional conference for RAs at Binghamton University titled ""#StopWhitePeople2K16."" The conference aimed to facilitate a discussion on diversity, privilege, and society.

33,"### Context: The claim that death and disease from leptospirosis is spread by rat urine on soda cans is not supported by evidence. Multiple accounts shared online have spread the tale of deaths supposedly caused by people drinking from soda cans contaminated with rat urine. However, there is no record of anyone dying in this manner. The stories lack specific details and cannot be verified. 

Leptospirosis is a potentially deadly illness caused by bacteria passed along to humans through contact with urine from diseased animals. It can be contracted in rural areas from swimming in contaminated lakes and reservoirs, and in cities from splashing through puddles in areas with a large rodent population. Eating or drinking contaminated food and water is also a risk. Leptospirosis typically causes aches, pains, and fever, but can also lead to more severe symptoms such as jaundice, meningitis, acute kidney failure, and internal bleeding. It is treatable with antibiotics.

Another disease passed on through rat urine is hantavirus, which is transmitted to humans through breathing in particles of an infected rodent's urine, droppings, or saliva. The virus becomes airborne when excrement dries. Early symptoms mimic the flu and can progress to respiratory failure. Since 1993, 21 deaths in the United States have been attributed to hantavirus.

While urine-encrusted soda cans are not likely to be purveyors of these diseases, it is still a good idea to wipe off cans from exposed six-packs or those dispensed from drink machines to avoid picking up any contaminants from human handlers. Most cans of soda are packaged into cardboard boxes on the production line and are not at risk of contamination. Soft drink bottlers also try to get the finished product to consumers quickly, minimizing the opportunity for rodents to use the tops of cans as latrines.

In conclusion, the claim that death and disease from leptospirosis is spread by rat urine on soda cans is not supported by evidence. While it is important to take precautions to avoid contracting diseases from contaminated food and water, the specific scenario described in the claim is not substantiated.

34,"### Context: The article analyzes a TV ad attacking Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, claiming that she is a ""rubber stamp"" for the ""Washington liberal agenda."" The ad accuses Heitkamp of supporting amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants, including domestic violence perpetrators and child abusers. However, the bipartisan immigration bill that Heitkamp supported would have toughened green card requirements, barring those convicted of domestic or child abuse who served a year or more in jail or had two or more convictions for those offenses. She did oppose a proposed amendment that included a provision that would have gone even further, blocking those with only one misdemeanor conviction for domestic or child abuse. The ad also claims that Heitkamp voted along with Trump's agenda only 55 percent of the time, which is the second highest percentage among Senate Democrats, according to FiveThirtyEight.

The article explains that the ad is from the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, and is aimed at expanding the Republican majority in the Senate. It also mentions that Heitkamp voted against the Cornyn amendment, which would have set ""triggers"" for eligible immigrants to pursue a path to citizenship, and voted for the Gang of Eight bill, which toughened the law with regard to domestic violence and child abuse. The ad overestimates the number of people who would have gained legal status under the bill by 3 million and misleadingly claims that they would have been granted ""amnesty."" The bill would have required immigrants seeking citizenship to pay fines and back taxes, prove gainful employment, complete criminal background checks, learn English and civics, and go to the back of the line behind legal immigrants who had already applied for citizenship.

The article also mentions that Heitkamp voted against bills that would have cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities, but it does not provide evidence to support the claim that she supported sanctuary cities like San Francisco. It notes that Heitkamp voted for Kate's Law, which sought to increase penalties for immigrants who return to the U.S. after being deported, and that she has voted in sync with Trump's position 55.3 percent of the time, making her one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate.

In conclusion, the article challenges the claims made in the TV ad against Heidi Heitkamp, providing evidence to counter the accusations of supporting amnesty and the Washington liberal agenda. It also highlights Heitkamp's voting record, which shows that she has voted in line with Trump's position more often than most Democrats.

35,"### Context: Merck, a pharmaceutical company, has announced that around 44,000 people have submitted the necessary documents to qualify for an interim payment in the program to resolve heart attack and stroke claims related to their arthritis pill, Vioxx. The drug was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 after research revealed that it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who took it for at least 18 months. As a result, Merck faced tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits from more than 20 million people who had used the drug.

In November, Merck reached a settlement agreement with individuals alleging injury from Vioxx. The agreement requires the company to meet an 85 percent threshold for receiving enrollment documents in various claims categories. If this threshold is met, Merck is obligated to pay $4.85 billion in installments into a resolution fund. Currently, around 5,500 eligible claimants alleging death due to heart attack and stroke have initiated enrollment, along with over 26,500 eligible claimants alleging more than 12 months of use. Additionally, the eligibility of another 5,000 claimants who have sought to enroll is yet to be determined. However, Merck expects to meet all enrollment thresholds.

To cover the cost of the settlement agreement, Merck recorded a pretax charge of $4.85 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Despite this, the company's shares were only slightly affected, with a decrease of 7 cents to $44.23 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Overall, Merck has seen thousands of people file for payments related to their arthritis pill, Vioxx, which was withdrawn from the market due to its increased risk of heart attack and stroke. The company has reached a settlement agreement and expects to meet all enrollment thresholds, obligating them to pay $4.85 billion in installments into a resolution fund.

36,"### Context: The article discusses a news segment that reports on a new weight-loss procedure called VBLOC. The segment mentions that the price of the procedure is speculative due to it being in the early stages of testing. However, it fails to provide sufficient details about the early research, such as the number of patients involved and the benefits experienced. The segment focuses on the efficacy of the treatment but downplays safety concerns and risks. It states that the treatment has few side effects, but fails to mention potential risks associated with blocking the vagus nerve or the possibility of the treatment becoming ineffective over time.

The segment is based on early results from clinical trials of the VBLOC procedure, but it does not provide enough information about the type and rigor of the trials or the number of participants involved. It claims that the procedure has shown impressive results in Australia but does not provide evidence to support this claim. The article criticizes the segment for not including comments from independent researchers or clinicians familiar with obesity treatments to provide better context.

The article also points out that the segment should have noted that the trials are being funded by the device maker. It suggests that the segment should have compared the VBLOC treatment to other weight-loss methods such as gastric banding, drug treatments, and diet and exercise, as information about their efficacy, safety, and costs is widely available.

The segment correctly states that the VBLOC treatment is in clinical trials and not yet available in the US. It explains that the treatment works by suppressing hunger through blocking the vagus nerve, which is a novel approach to weight loss.

The article concludes by suggesting that the news segment may have relied heavily on a news release and criticizes the inclusion of only one physician who is an investigator in the trials, as they have a vested interest. It suggests that the segment could have been stronger if it had included information from a company press release about the results of the clinical trials.
Claim: Scarless weight-loss surgery: pacemaker for your hunger
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This TV segment focuses on an experimental obesity treatment: vagal blocking (VBLOC). The treatment involves implanting an electrical device which intermittently blocks the vagus nerve, which is involved with feelings of hunger and satiety. The segment does a few things well:   It introduces a patient who, one month into the therapy, has had promising but not spectacular results. It repeatedly mentions that the procedure is experimental, not yet available and unapproved for use in the U.S. It makes clear that VBLOC appears to be less effective than gastric bypass surgery, with possible weight loss of 20 percent at six months compared to 50 percent for bypass. But the segment could have been stronger:   It should have included at least one fully independent expert who could put the technique into perspective It should have provided more detail about the state and quality of the research upon which the promising results are based It should have emphasized the potential harms of the treatment, not the least of which is that it might not work for some people. For a treatment with a price tag of $15,000 to $20,000, that’s a significant risk. It’s worth noting that the host and reporter at the end of the piece discuss the fact that controlling physiological hunger is itself not a complete solution. People overeat for many reasons, including emotional ones. This is a responsible way to end the piece–with the thought that VBLOC may eventually be a useful treatment, but not a complete cure for obesity. But the piece also raises a larger question: Is it responsible to report on the VBLOC technique at this time? The current trial is on a small number of people. A larger trial has begun, but none of the data have been peer-reviewed or published. It may have been more prudent to wait until the research is published (if indeed it will be) before doing a story on this obesity treatment.",Scarless weight-loss surgery: pacemaker for your hunger,"This was a story about a new weight loss procedure that is in the early stages of clinical trials.

Local news channels reported that officers from the Daphne Police Department had entered the restaurant but were refused service by employees. Five Guys responded by stating that they were actively investigating the situation and were committed to fair and equal treatment for all customers. The police department clarified that the officers involved were wearing face masks at the time of the alleged incident. Some social media users called for a boycott of all Five Guys restaurants based on the false premise that the company had a policy of refusing service to police officers. On July 10, Five Guys announced that some employees had been fired and others suspended. The restaurant temporarily closed for further education and customer service training with a representative from the police department. Five Guys emphasized that the actions of a few employees did not represent the company or the local franchisee. An unnamed police source confirmed that several officers had been refused service and claimed that the employees had turned their backs towards them. However, neither the police department nor Five Guys provided specific details about what had occurred in the restaurant. Snopes obtained a statement from a police department spokesperson, who confirmed that the officers were refused service by two employees responsible for taking orders.

39,"### Context: The Chicago Department of Water Management has been providing lead-testing kits to residents upon request due to concerns about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan and a 2013 study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Chicago homes. The kits include three sample bottles for testing water at different stages. According to a Chicago Tribune analysis, nearly 70 percent of the almost 2,800 homes tested over the past two years had detectable levels of lead. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration limits lead concentrations in bottled water to 5 parts per billion, but tap water in 30 percent of homes exceeded this limit. Lake Michigan water is typically lead-free when it leaves the city's treatment plants, but it becomes contaminated as it passes through service lines and internal plumbing made of lead. Until 1986, Chicago required the use of lead service lines to connect street mains and homes, and individual property owners are responsible for maintaining these lines. City and EPA officials recommend flushing household plumbing for up to five minutes when water hasn't been used for several hours. However, tests conducted since January 2016 found that about 20 percent of Chicago homes still had high levels of lead even after running water for three minutes. The EPA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that it is unsafe to consume lead at any level. Ingesting lead can cause brain damage in children and contribute to health problems such as heart disease and kidney failure in adults.

40,"### Context: Robyn Benson, a brain-dead Canadian woman, was kept on life support for several weeks in order to save her fetus. Benson collapsed on her bathroom floor at 22 weeks pregnant and was later declared brain-dead due to a hemorrhage. Her husband, Dylan Benson, made the decision to keep her body alive for up to 7 more weeks to give their baby, named Iver Cohen Benson, a greater chance of survival. The goal was to wait until the fetus reached 34 weeks before delivering him via cesarean section. The baby would then spend his first few weeks in the hospital. After the birth, the family would take the mother off life support, setting up a bittersweet deadline for the family. Benson expressed his difficulty in knowing that their son would grow up without his mother and that he would have to say goodbye to her shortly after seeing their baby for the first time.

This case differs from a controversial case in Texas where a brain-dead pregnant woman, Marlise Munoz, was removed from life support at her husband's request. Unlike the Benson baby, Munoz's fetus had already suffered oxygen deprivation and appeared to have deformed lower extremities. The Texas authorities fought to keep Munoz on life support, sparking a debate over the rights of a fetus versus the right to die.

The Benson family's situation has gained attention and support from people across Canada and around the world. Donations on their fundraising site have exceeded their goal of C$36,000, reaching over C$85,000. The funds were intended to cover medical bills, baby supplies, and allow Dylan Benson to spend more time at home with his new son after the birth.

A spokesperson for the Vancouver Island health authority confirmed that Robyn Benson was in the intensive care unit at Victoria General Hospital but could not provide further details due to privacy issues.

The study did not provide information on the cost of the Decipher test, but a New York Times article suggests that similar genomic tests for prostate cancer cost around $3,000 or more. The release states that the Decipher test has the ability to change the minds of urologists and radiation oncologists and get them to agree on the best course of action for patients after prostate gland removal. However, the release does not provide information on the number of patients with recurrent cancer or metastasis, the effectiveness of radiation or other therapies after prostatectomy, or the effectiveness of the Decipher test in saving lives. The release also does not explain the risks that patients face from adjuvant therapies or the reliability of the Decipher test. The study had a small sample size of clinicians and patient cases, and the release lacks context on these limitations. The release does not disclose the funding source or potential conflicts of interest, unlike the study itself. The release also does not mention any alternatives to the Decipher test. The authors of the study provided clinicians with information about risk groups, PSA, and pathology of the cancer, but it is unclear if the initial decisions followed accepted practice. The release mentions that Decipher is commercially available and can be covered by Medicare, but it does not provide clear information on the independent value added by the test.

Claim: New Study Published on Cover of Urology Finds that Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier Reduces Conflicting Treatment Recommendations between Urologists and Radiation Oncologists
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"In this news release, we’re introduced to a world of confusion among doctors about what to do with a man after they remove his cancerous, walnut-sized prostate gland. And the release offers something that can allegedly reduce that confusion: GenomeDx Biosciences’ Decipher, a test that sniffs out 22 different genetic signals of how a cancer case might play out. Next we’re told about the struggle between urologists and radiation oncologists. The former group is less likely than the latter to prescribe “adjuvant therapy,” typically radiation, after removing a prostate gland. Missing high-risk cancer cases and not treating them is a problem, of course, but so is treating men who probably don’t need it. (Although we’re never really told why that’s an issue.) According to the release, Decipher has the ability to change the minds of both urologists (45%) and radiation oncologists (35%), and get more of them to agree what or what not to do with a patient after removal of his cancerous prostate gland. That’s potentially an important advance, but we aren’t provided with crucial context — notably that it’s unclear if the decisions made because of Decipher were actually better decisions that would lead to a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. We’re also never cautioned about the small size of the study, given cost information about the test, or told about potential harms. Among cancers in men, prostate cancer is the second-most common – about 1 in 5 men in the U.S. will get a diagnosis in their lifetimes. It’s also the second-most deadly: Of the more than 200,000 men diagnosed each year in the U.S., nearly 30,000 die. (At least twice as many more black men succumb to prostate cancer as other ethnic groups.) Testing prostate cancer for how likely it is to grow quickly and migrate (metastasize) might save a lot of men from unnecessary follow-up treatments and unwanted side effects. So, a reliable tool to help clinicians make informed choices – and with a consensus of opinion among the doctors a patient sees – stands to help everyone while reducing costs associated with prostate cancer.",New Study Published on Cover of Urology Finds that Decipher® Prostate Cancer Classifier Reduces Conflicting Treatment Recommendations between Urologists and Radiation Oncologists,"This news release describes a study of 100 urologists and radiation oncologists in the U.S. who were asked to make treatment recommendations for 100 hypothetical patients with prostate cancer.

The author criticizes the news release for not mentioning the high cost of the drug, which is estimated to be around $12,600 per month. The release also fails to address whether health insurance would cover the cost. The author points out that the patients' response to the treatment was modest, with only five out of 18 patients showing a response. The release does not mention potential harms of the drug, such as fatigue, low white blood cells, and decreased appetite. The author argues that the release should have explained how the reduction in tumor size or other treatment responses would translate into quality of life and survival rates for patients. The release mentions that final clinical results will be reported at a conference, but does not provide details on when or what additional data will be released. The author also criticizes the release for not being transparent about financial backing and potential conflicts of interest among the researchers. The release does not mention that immunotherapy may offer a less toxic alternative to traditional chemotherapy. It also neglects to mention that the HPV vaccine has been proven to prevent anal precancerous lesions. The release describes nivolumab as one of the drugs in the growing arsenal of immunotherapy therapies, but does not specify if it has FDA approval for anal cancer or any other application. The author suggests that the release could have clarified whether this is the first trial of any immunotherapy drug for anal cancer and how it contributes to the body of evidence on immunotherapy drugs. The author also criticizes the use of the word ""encouraging"" in the release without a quote from a researcher to support it. The study abstract only mentions potential correlations between immunological biomarkers and clinical outcomes to nivolumab.
Claim: First-ever nivolumab study to treat aggressive anal cancer appears promising
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"As the nation’s largest cancer center, MD Anderson made a splash in 2012 with its ambitious announcement of a multi-billion dollar Moon Shots Program, which it called an unprecedented effort to rapidly convert scientific discoveries into life-saving advances. This news release, about a phase II clinical trial of the immunotherapy drug nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) for one type of anal cancer, is decidedly more down to earth. The news release refrains from hype but still falls short of the mark when it comes to describing costs, potential harms, and comparisons with existing treatments. While calling results “encouraging,” the news release would be more helpful if it provided a meaningful assessment of whether this therapy might advance the Moon Shot’s directive of saving lives. Anal cancer is relatively rare. The American Cancer Society projects 8,080 new cases and 1,080 deaths in 2016. The number of new anal cancer cases has been rising. It is found mainly in older adults, with an average age in the early 60s. The risk of being diagnosed with anal cancer during one’s lifetime is about 1 in 500, with women at slightly higher risk. Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is the most common form of anal cancer and is linked to infection by the human papilloma virus (HPV), the same virus that causes cervical cancer. The chemotherapy and radiation protocols that have been used to treat anal cancer have remained little changed since the 1970s, and there is no FDA-approved chemotherapy drug specific to anal cancer, according to the HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation.

43,"### Context: The article discusses the death of an anti-seat belt law advocate named Derek Kieper in a car accident. Kieper had written an editorial in 2004 opposing mandatory seat belt laws, arguing that they infringed upon individual rights. However, in January 2005, Kieper died in a car crash where he was ejected from the vehicle because he was not wearing a seat belt. The accident occurred on an icy section of Interstate 80, and the Ford Explorer Kieper was a passenger in rolled several times in a ditch. The driver and another passenger sustained non-life threatening injuries and were wearing seat belts at the time of the accident. The article also mentions another incident in July 2011, where a motorcyclist participating in a protest against mandatory helmet laws was killed in a similar manner. Philip A. Contos, the motorcyclist, lost control of his bike, hit his head on the pavement, and died. State police stated that Contos would have survived if he had been wearing a helmet as required by law.

The article highlights the irony of these incidents, as both individuals who opposed safety regulations ultimately lost their lives in accidents where the use of seat belts or helmets could have saved them. It emphasizes the importance of seat belts and helmets in preventing injuries and fatalities in car accidents. The article indirectly supports the claim that there is a group of drivers and passengers who refuse to wear seat belts due to various reasons, including discomfort, skepticism about their effectiveness, and opposition to government intrusion. However, it also serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the potential consequences of not wearing seat belts or helmets.

44,"### Context: Pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has announced positive results from a trial of its drug belantamab mafodotin in treating multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. The trial found that two doses of the drug helped subdue the disease in adults who had received three prior treatments. GSK plans to seek market approval and submit data from the trial to regulatory bodies this year. Belantamab mafodotin targets a protein linked to multiple myeloma known as BCMA. GSK's Chief Scientific Officer, Hal Barron, stated that the company is on track to file for approval of the drug later this year and is continuing to investigate how it could help more patients with the disease. The details of the trial will be presented at a medical conference in the future. The positive results of the trial are seen as a sign of GSK's successful turnaround in cancer treatment research. GSK has been building its oncology pipeline, including a deal to acquire US firm Tesaro for $5.1 billion last year and an agreement with Germany's Merck KGaA for the rights to a next-generation immunotherapy. In another recent win in oncology, GSK's drug Zejula was shown to slow the progression of ovarian cancer. The positive results of the belantamab mafodotin trial further support the use of antibody drug conjugates (ADC), a class of molecules that the drug belongs to. ADCs are antibodies with a cell toxin attached, allowing chemotherapeutic agents to be delivered to cancer cells at higher doses than conventional chemotherapy. GSK's shares rose following the announcement of the trial results. Multiple myeloma is the second most common form of blood cancer, and while it can be treated, there is currently no cure. The disease is expected to cause 13,000 deaths in the US in 2019. The BCMA protein targeted by belantamab mafodotin is also being used as a target in cell therapies developed by other pharmaceutical companies.

45,"### Context: The article discusses the ONCOblot test, which is used for early detection of 26 different cancers. The article criticizes the fact that the company selling the test does not disclose its price. Some clinics list the test cost at $850 or $1000, but it is unclear how often the test would need to be repeated for people exposed to asbestos. The article also points out that the press release about the test lacks important information such as accuracy, sensitivity, sample size, and duration of the study.

The article raises concerns about the potential harms of overdiagnosis if the test produces false positives. It mentions that early treatment for mesothelioma, a cancer caused by asbestos exposure, can have damaging side effects such as hair loss, mouth sores, loss of appetite, and lung damage. The article argues that while early detection may offer a small survival advantage, it comes at a cost.

The article criticizes the small sample size of the study, which included only 17 cancer patients and 15 people exposed to asbestos but not diagnosed with cancer. It highlights the need for validation in a larger, independent cohort of patients and prospective sampling.

The article also questions the implication in the press release that the test could be useful for anyone exposed to asbestos, noting that most people exposed to asbestos never get mesothelioma. It points out that the only person quoted in the press release is the company's vice president of business development, not a researcher.

The article mentions that there are alternative methods for detecting mesothelioma, such as repeat chest CT scans, but these have not been verified in a clinical trial. It also notes that basic primary care and watchfulness are alternatives.

Overall, the article criticizes the press release for creating false hope and not providing enough information about the test's usefulness and potential risks. It suggests that the test may be useful for researchers planning clinical trials of early treatment for mesothelioma, but it is not exciting for individuals concerned about their personal risk of developing the disease.
Claim: The test that reveals cancer sooner
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release describes findings from a retrospective study on a blood test marketed for the early detection of cancer, in this case asbestos-related malignant mesothelioma. The test screens for the presence of the protein ENOX2 which researchers say exists only on the surface of a malignant cancer cell. The MorNuCo company is “elated to share” news about this “exciting” ONCOblot cancer marker blood test. To make sure you don’t miss the “exciting” point, the word is used three times in a release that is only nine sentences long. The release falls short on data and relies on fear-mongering to engage people worried about cancer risk because of exposure to asbestos. The release flogs the myth that early detection is always a good thing, thus raising false hopes. To give powerful cancer treatments too soon, or even unnecessarily, does enormous harm, justified only if the potential benefit is clear. Not only does this study of the ONCOblot test fail to provide any evidence that early detection could provide a benefit to people exposed to asbestos (most of whom will never get mesothelioma), the retrospective study of a few people who have been diagnosed with mesothelioma cannot even demonstrate that the test could reliably predict who is likely to develop the disease, something that will have to be tested by prospective studies. The authors of the study noted the following in their conclusions: “As with all biomarker studies, these observations require validation in a larger, independent cohort of patients and should include prospective as well as retrospective sampling.” The news release failed to communicate that message.",The test that reveals cancer sooner,"This news release describes a blood test that detects a protein called soluble mesothelin related peptide (SMRP) that is elevated in people with mesothelioma, a rare cancer of the pleura.

46,"### Context: In 2011, key state legislators in Wisconsin approved a multifaceted amendment to cut the budget and make changes to the University of Wisconsin System. One of the lesser-known aspects of this amendment was item number 27, which dealt with changes in the state statute regarding ""crimes against animals."" The amendment aimed to provide liability protections for scientific researchers to protect their vital research from potential lawsuits or criminal prosecutions by animal rights activists.

The Wisconsin Humane Society protested this amendment, claiming that it would exempt scientific researchers from all state animal cruelty laws. The executive director of the Humane Society argued that Wisconsin law already exempted bona fide scientific researchers from animal mistreatment and poisoning statutes, but the budget bill amendment would exempt researchers from the entirety of Chapter 951, the criminal laws relating to animal cruelty.

The amendment was inserted into the budget bill without public hearing or discussion. It grew out of concerns about legal liability for researchers following criminal investigations into the use of sheep and mice in experiments at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2009, the university researchers were found to have violated the crimes against animals law, but no charges were filed. In 2010, animal rights groups sought criminal charges against university officials, but a special prosecutor determined that no laws were broken.

The proposed changes in the amendment would exempt university researchers from the state statute providing criminal penalties for animal cruelty. Supporters of the change argue that federal laws, such as the Animal Welfare Act, and the university's own ethical standards are sufficient to ensure research is conducted within legal standards.

The amendment was sought by a coalition of bioscience researchers, including the Medical College of Wisconsin, UW Health, and UW Madison. They argued that the change would remove the threat of criminal prosecutions for bona fide researchers.

The Wisconsin Humane Society expressed concerns about the amendment, including the potential loophole in the language that did not explicitly distinguish between public and private educational institutions. They also argued that local district attorneys would be more inclined to listen to complaints than federal authorities, making state statutes more meaningful.

In conclusion, the amendment inserted into the state budget in Wisconsin exempted scientific researchers from all state animal cruelty laws. There is disagreement about the impact of this change, with supporters arguing that federal laws and ethical standards would still apply. The Wisconsin Humane Society raised concerns about potential loopholes and the importance of state statutes in addressing animal cruelty.

47,"### Context: The poisoning occurred in Laguna and Quezon, two provinces south of Manila, and all had consumed lambanog, a drink popular in provinces and consumed widely during holidays and celebrations. Many were admitted to hospitals on the urging of mayor Vener Munoz in Rizal, Laguna, where the deaths occurred between Thursday and Sunday. Two people who had been in critical condition were improving, he told local radio. The coconut wine that was consumed had been made in his town, he added. Blood tests and samples of leftover lambanog would be collected and analyzed on Monday, the Department of Health said. “All had a sad history of lambanog ingestion,” the department said, referring to those poisoned. “Some bought for leisure drinking and birthday party, while others were donated by local officials during their Christmas party.”  Unregulated production and sales of lambanog are common in the Philippines, and it is often made illegally with dangerous additives. The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously warned about the dangerous and prohibited use of methanol as an additive in home brews. A year ago, the FDA and police were deployed to locate and confiscate unregistered lambanog that was being openly sold to the public, and threatened to prosecute sellers. Twenty-one people died after consuming lambanog last year, media reported.

48,"### Context: The article addresses various claims and rumors surrounding the 2017 total solar eclipse over North America. One claim suggests that the eclipse was calculated for the wrong year, but NASA astrophysicist C. Alex Young dismisses this as a hoax. The article provides information about the path of totality, which is a thin ribbon that will cross the US from west to east. It also mentions that around 10 million people live along this path, with many more traveling to areas where the eclipse will be visible. The article emphasizes that watching the eclipse through a livestream on a laptop or desktop computer will not cause eye damage. It also explains that the eclipse is not harmful to health unless one looks directly at the sun before or after totality without the appropriate protective glasses. The article warns against using regular sunglasses or camera filters to view the eclipse, as they do not offer sufficient protection. It mentions that Amazon issued a recall for certain counterfeit viewing glasses, but legitimate and verified eclipse viewing glasses were also caught up in the recall. The article states that eclipse glasses do not expire as long as they are not damaged, and it clarifies that pets are not in immediate danger of eye damage during the eclipse. The article refutes the claim that the eclipse will cause earthquakes or damage infrastructure, but it does mention that there may be traffic increases and shortages of necessities due to the number of people traveling to view the eclipse. The article confirms that NASA will launch bacteria-filled balloons during the eclipse as part of the Eclipse Ballooning Project. It also mentions that some observatories and event planners are selling tickets to specific viewing areas and festivals, but it clarifies that there is no need to buy a ticket unless one wants to share the experience with others. The article addresses a press release from a group claiming to be associated with the coal industry, stating that they plan to protest the eclipse. However, the article expresses skepticism about the legitimacy of the press release. Finally, the article dismisses the claim that personal electronics such as cellphones pose a danger during the eclipse due to cosmic rays or gamma rays.

",mixture,"Eclipses only occur if the Moon is located within 0.5 degrees of the plane of the ecliptic, on a line that passes through the center of the Sun and the Earth. The Moon travels along an orbit that is inclined by 5 degrees to the ecliptic plane, so there are only two opportunities each month when it passes through the plane of the ecliptic. These points are called the ascending and descending nodes. Eclipses of the Sun only occur if new moon occurs when the Moon is near of one of these nodes. A similar argument explains why lunar eclipses do not occur every full moon at the node opposite the Sun from the Earth.",We check an assortment of claims about the 2017 total solar eclipse over North America.,"The 2017 total solar eclipse over North America is a rare and exciting event, but it won’t cause earthquakes, damage to your eyes, or infrastructure."
49,"### Context: Mobile clinics are becoming increasingly popular in the United States as a way to control the rising cost of healthcare. These clinics, like the Family Van in Boston, provide free checks of blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels to low-income individuals. The goal is to catch health problems early or help manage existing conditions, such as diabetes. The Family Van, which is affiliated with Harvard University, visits six low-income neighborhoods in Boston each week. There are approximately 2,000 mobile clinics in the United States, and their numbers are growing.

Advocates argue that mobile clinics can help reduce healthcare costs by keeping people with chronic diseases out of the emergency room, which is often the first choice for inner-city residents. The United States spends $2.5 trillion on healthcare each year, which is considerably higher than any other developed economy. The mobile clinics are mostly nonprofit and provide general medical care, although some specialize in dentistry or mammography. Urban clinics often rely on healthcare educators and students as staff, referring patients to doctors or hospitals when necessary. Rural clinics, on the other hand, typically have doctors and nurses on board to serve communities without healthcare facilities.

The Family Van estimates that every dollar it spends on operations results in $36 in economic benefits. The average visit to the Family Van costs $117, compared to $923 for a nonemergency visit to a hospital emergency room. These clinics can also help reduce overall healthcare costs by identifying health problems before they become critical. However, it is important to note that clinics staffed by educators cannot provide the same level of care as a visit to a doctor.

Even in Massachusetts, where almost every resident is required to have health insurance, many inner-city residents still turn to hospital emergency rooms first. This issue may become more prevalent across the United States with the implementation of the healthcare reform law, which aims to extend health insurance to 32 million uninsured Americans. The Family Van's executive director, Jennifer Bennet, explains that while everyone may have a doctor on paper, they may not be able to get in to see them due to a lack of available doctors.

In conclusion, mobile clinics are seen as a way to cut the U.S. health bill by providing accessible and affordable healthcare to underserved populations. These clinics can help control costs by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and catching health problems early. However, they are not a substitute for comprehensive medical care provided by doctors.

The announcement came on November 8, 2017, and the game will allow players to learn spells, explore their real-world surroundings, and team up with others to fight legendary beasts and powerful enemies. Niantic will be partnering with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and WB Games San Francisco's development team to bring the magical world of Harry Potter to life in a new way. The game will leverage the Niantic Platform and will also pioneer new technology and gameplay mechanics. 

The article also mentions that rumors of a Harry Potter version of Pokémon Go, called ""Harry Potter Go,"" had been circulating since the summer of 2016. These rumors started as speculative memes and petitions, but eventually gained traction and reached news media outlets. Some articles reported that Niantic had announced the development of the game, citing an interview with Niantic's senior developer Marcus Figueroa. However, it was later revealed that the interview and the announcement were fake, and no plans for ""Harry Potter Go"" were in the works at that time.

The article concludes by stating that while the rumors of a Harry Potter version of Pokémon Go turned out to be false in 2016, the announcement of ""Harry Potter: Wizards Unite"" in 2017 shows that a Harry Potter game is indeed being developed by Niantic.

51,"### Context: According to an article, House Speaker Dean Cannon stated that one-third of the 120-member House in Florida consists of freshmen lawmakers, while two-thirds of the chamber have two years of experience or less. This turnover is a result of term limits for state representatives and senators in Florida. The article also provides some background on term limits, stating that they were implemented in 1992 as a response to scandals in Congress. The article mentions that term limits can bring fresh faces and new ideas to the legislature, but they are also blamed for various issues such as myopia among legislators and the influence of special interest money and lobbyists.

To verify Cannon's claim, the article provides information on the number of freshmen and relatively new members in the 2011 Legislature. According to Cannon's spokeswoman, there are 82 freshman or sophomore legislators, with 44 of them being freshmen. The article then breaks down the number of members elected in each year from 2007 to 2010, totaling 82. It also mentions that three members had previous experience in the House, and two were elected in special elections. The article discusses different ways to define ""freshmen"" and calculates that the freshmen class represents about 32-37% of the House, depending on how certain members are counted. 

Regarding the claim about two-thirds of the members having two years of experience or less, the article counts the number of members elected in 2008, 2009, and 2010, totaling 77. This represents 64% of the House, or 62% if the three lawmakers with previous experience are not counted. The article also mentions a suggestion from Cannon's spokeswoman to count five lawmakers who won special elections in 2007 as sophomores, but the article disagrees with this classification.

In conclusion, the article verifies House Speaker Dean Cannon's claim that one-third of the 120-member House in Florida consists of freshmen lawmakers, and two-thirds of the chamber have two years of experience or less.

52,"### Context: The article discusses the growing international trade in waste tires, particularly to developing countries like India and Malaysia. The global trade in waste tires has nearly doubled in the past five years, with Britain being the largest exporter, followed by Italy and the United States. India is the biggest buyer, accounting for 32% of global imports last year, up from 7% five years ago.

While many tires are sent to recycling operations that comply with regulations, there is also a significant trade to backyard pyrolysis operations that do not comply with emissions and waste disposal regulations. This trade in waste tires is causing pollution in the communities that host them, according to local authorities and health experts.

The trade in waste tires has been driven by the cheaper cost of shipping them abroad compared to recycling them domestically in developed countries. The demand for industrial furnaces in countries like India, the availability of inexpensive Chinese pyrolysis equipment, and weak regulations worldwide have also contributed to the trade.

Pyrolysis, the process of burning tires to make fuel, is seen as a relatively clean way of disposing of tires and turning them into useful fuel. However, controlling emissions and processing waste residue from the burning of tires is expensive and difficult to make profitable on a mass scale. Many pyrolysis plants in India and Malaysia do not comply with environmental standards and expose workers to pollution.

The environmental impact of pyrolysis has led some exporting countries to take notice. Australia, a major exporter of tires to Southeast Asia and India, has announced plans to ban waste exports, including tires. Burning tires without adequate emissions controls can release toxic chemicals and gases into the environment, causing short-term effects like skin irritation and lung infections, and long-term effects like heart attacks and lung cancer.

The article also highlights the role of Britain in the trade, as many of the tires that end up in Indian villages are imported from Britain. Unlike most European countries, Britain does not have requirements for tire collection and treatment, making it easier for small firms to obtain licenses to collect waste tires and sell them abroad.

India is considering banning all but the most sophisticated pyrolysis operations in response to backlash from environmental groups and residents. However, there are still numerous unlicensed pyrolysis businesses operating across India, contributing to pollution and health issues in local communities.

55,"### Context: The article discusses a study that found a new motivational intervention called FIT (Functional Imagery Training) can significantly boost weight loss. The study involved 141 participants who were overweight and were randomly assigned to either receive FIT or Motivational Interviewing (MI) sessions. FIT involves helping individuals create mental images of their desired goals and the steps needed to achieve them, while MI focuses on exploring and resolving ambivalence towards change. 

The study found that participants who received FIT lost an average of 4.11 kg at six months and 4.43 kg at twelve months, compared to 0.74 kg and 0.67 kg for the MI group. Additionally, the FIT group also experienced greater reductions in waist circumference. The study did not evaluate the weight loss methods used by participants, but focused on the extent to which they were motivated to make changes based on the intervention.

The article highlights some limitations of the study. It mentions that the cost of the sessions and follow-up consultations was not mentioned, which is important considering the multiple sessions required. It also notes that the starting weight and waist circumference of the groups were not provided, making it difficult to determine if one group found it more difficult to lose weight. The article suggests that it would have been valuable to include language encouraging people to consult a healthcare provider before making abrupt lifestyle changes.

The study design is described fairly well in the article, but some crucial information is missing. It is unclear if the FIT and MI groups had comparable numbers of men and women, if they were comparable in age, or if they were comparable in terms of overall health. The article suggests that it is important to know what weight loss methods the groups used, as this could account for the difference in outcomes.

The article also raises questions about the definition of ""overweight"" used in the study, as having a BMI of 25 puts individuals on the borderline between ""normal"" and ""overweight."" It suggests that weight loss is not inherently good and that health should be assessed beyond just BMI.

The funding source of the study is identified and there are no apparent conflicts of interest. However, the article suggests that it would have been stronger if it directly addressed conflicts of interest. It also mentions that it would be valuable to see how effective FIT is when used in conjunction with proven weight loss techniques.

The article does not provide information on the availability or widespread use of FIT, and it notes that the term ""novel"" used to describe FIT may not be accurate since researchers have been publishing on FIT since at least May 2016. The article suggests that the study should have placed the work in context with other research in the field.

Overall, the article provides a summary of the study on FIT and its impact on weight loss, but also highlights some limitations and areas where more information would have been valuable.
Claim: Weight loss can be boosted fivefold thanks to novel mental imagery technique
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The news release focuses on a study reporting that overweight individuals who engaged in functional imagery training (FIT) were more successful at losing weight than individuals who engaged in a type of talk therapy called motivational interviewing (MI). However, the release does not answer many questions that are relevant to determining how useful FIT is for weight loss. For example, because the study does not appear to have collected information on diet or exercise, it’s not clear whether the difference in outcomes stems from differences in lifestyle choices made by study participants. It would have been helpful if the release (and study) had analyzed specifically how increased motivation and lifestyle choices can result in weight loss. The published study notes that data relating to “participants’ experiences and process variables, including frequency of motivational cognitions, self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, self-reported diet and physical activity” were collected but that the results would be reported separately. When comparing the efficacy of MI and FIT, it’s important to know what sort of lifestyle changes study participants made. If a significant percentage of participants who engaged in FIT also joined a for-profit diet program, that support system might explain the differing results. By the same token, it’s not clear if the MI group and the FIT group were matched for initial weight, sex or age — any of which could influence how much weight was lost. Without knowledge of those details, it is difficult or impossible to say how much more effective FIT was than MI (if at all). According to the published research, there were some differences in full-time employment and the range in baseline weight that weren’t addressed in the limitations section of the study and which could affect the reliability of the data.",Weight loss can be boosted fivefold thanks to novel mental imagery technique,"This news release describes a study that compared the effectiveness of two types of motivational interventions for weight loss: functional imagery training (FIT) and motivational interviewing (MI). The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it could have been improved by providing more detail on the limitations of the study, and by placing the work in context with other research in the field. The release also could have been improved by addressing conflicts of interest, and by providing more detail on the cost and availability of FIT. Obesity is a major health problem in the U.S. and other developed countries. It is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. A number of interventions have been shown to be effective in helping people lose weight, including dietary changes, exercise, and behavioral interventions. Motivational interviewing is a well-established behavioral intervention that has been shown to be effective in helping people make changes in their lives. Functional imagery training is a newer intervention that has been shown to be effective in helping people make changes in their lives. The study described in this release found that functional imagery training was more effective than motivational interviewing in helping people lose weight."
56,"### Context: The article discusses a new breast reconstruction technique that claims to provide better outcomes and less discomfort for women recovering from breast cancer. However, the article criticizes the lack of specific information and evidence to support these claims. The article questions the quantification of the benefits of the procedure, such as reduced pain, faster recovery time, improved mobility, and aesthetic outcome. It also highlights the lack of information about the risks and necessity of mastectomy and reconstructive breast surgery, as well as the potential complications of implants. The article emphasizes the need for more research and studies to evaluate the procedure's effectiveness and identify the best candidates for it. It also suggests that the patient's positive comments may be influenced by compensation from the hospital. The article criticizes the lack of information about alternative reconstructive breast surgeries and the one-size-fits-all approach to breast cancer reconstruction. It questions whether the hospital plans to perform the surgery again for qualifying patients. The article also notes that the technique is not new and is only new within a specific corner of New Jersey. It criticizes the use of hyped terms like ""innovative"" and phrases such as ""game-changer"" without sufficient evidence to support them. Overall, the article highlights the lack of specific information, evidence, and context in the article about the new breast reconstruction technique.
Claim: New Breast Reconstruction Technique Provides Better Outcomes, Less Discomfort for Women Recovering From Breast Cancer
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"It’s hard to ignore a news release that claims a reconstructive breast surgery technique is “innovative” and “has the potential to be a ‘game-changer,'” as does this one from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, New Jersey. The release focuses on the outcome of one 43-year-old woman who received the hospital system’s first attempt at the surgery and is quoted extensively in the release. The procedure in question is available to some women who get a mastectomy following diagnosis, yet want an implant to recreate the appearance of their breast or breasts. After the breast tissue is removed, a balloon-like sac is temporarily placed in the void left behind and gradually filled with fluid. This prepares the skin and muscles nearby for a permanent implant, which is typically inserted a couple of months later for “an excellent aesthetic outcome.” This all sounds wonderful, but our review team (which includes a breast surgeon) thought the release was nearly devoid of crucial context. It doesn’t adequately discuss costs, risks, evidence, or alternatives, and it doesn’t make clear how this procedure differs from similar, more common implant techniques. It also trumpets the outcome of one woman, whose experience with the procedure — while extremely positive — may not hold true for many women who elect to have mastectomies. At best, this release is an incomplete advertisement. Electing to have breast surgery is often an extraordinarily difficult decision: Every patient’s cancer, her risks, and her needs are different. And while it’s nice to have options for reconstructive breast surgery — a topic that’s important to women affected by breast cancer — the advantages or disadvantages of one procedure over another seems to become less clear as more techniques become available. That’s why it’s increasingly important for medical institutions that promote the latest-and-greatest cosmetic procedure make clear its place in a cornucopia of alternatives, and adequately discuss the risks of surgeries that may have little or no bearing on survival or other critical outcomes.","New Breast Reconstruction Technique Provides Better Outcomes, Less Discomfort for Women Recovering From Breast Cancer","This story is about a new technique for breast reconstruction that is supposedly less painful and has a faster recovery time. The story is a rehash of a news release from Hackensack University Medical Center, which announced that it was the first hospital in New Jersey to perform the procedure. The story is a word-for-word rehash of the news release, and it suffers from the same problems. The story doesn’t provide any evidence to support the claim that the procedure is less painful and has a faster recovery time. It also doesn’t provide any information about the costs of the procedure, or the risks. The story also doesn’t provide any information about the evidence behind the procedure, or how it compares to other breast reconstruction procedures. The story also doesn’t provide any information about the patient who is profiled in the story. The patient is identified as “Mary,” but we don’t know anything about her. We don’t know her age, or her medical history. We don’t know if she had a mastectomy because she had breast cancer, or if she had it for another reason. We don’t know if she had a single-stage or a two-stage procedure. We don’t know if she had a latissimus dorsi flap procedure, or if she had a DIEP flap procedure.

57,"### Context: According to James Rockall, CEO of the World LPG Association, more people die from indoor air pollution than from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis combined. This claim was made during a speech at Stanford University and was based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Rockall's group represents the interests of the liquified petroleum gas industry, which burns more cleanly than wood or coal.

To fact-check this claim, the article compared the 2012 estimates of deaths from indoor air pollution to the 2012 mortality estimates for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The numbers showed that deaths from indoor air pollution totaled 4.2 million, while the combined deaths from the three diseases were 3.7 million. Rockall used different underlying estimates to reach a total of 2.9 million deaths due to the three diseases, but the article found no estimates that contradicted his basic point.

However, counting deaths from indoor air pollution is more complicated than tracking deaths from infectious diseases. Mark Wilson, a professor of epidemiology, explained that it is easier to identify someone with HIV/AIDS, malaria, or tuberculosis, whereas defining how someone dies from indoor air pollution is more challenging. Various physiological, immunological, and toxicological processes can compromise someone's health, making it difficult to attribute the cause of death solely to indoor air pollution.

The WHO study on indoor air pollution made assumptions to link diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ischemic heart disease to indoor air pollution. While the article acknowledges that there is a greater chance of uncertainty in these assumptions compared to counts of deaths from infectious diseases, it concludes that deaths from indoor air pollution still surpass those from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined.

In summary, the claim that more people die from indoor air pollution than from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis combined is supported by the data. However, it is important to note the complexities involved in attributing deaths solely to indoor air pollution and the assumptions made in the WHO study.
Claim: More (people) die from indoor air pollution than from malaria, HIV/AIDS and TB combined.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Rockall said more people die of indoor air pollution than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. We compared 2012 estimates of indoor air pollution deaths to a range of estimates for the three infectious diseases for 2012 and later. No matter how we did it, the deaths due to indoor air pollution trumped those due to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. But an epidemiologist offered the caveat that the indoor air pollution study relied on assumptions that introduce a greater chance of uncertainty than counts of deaths from the leading infectious diseases.

58,"### Context: The article provides a summary of a controversy surrounding a speech given by Kamala Harris in 2010. Some commentators claimed that Harris was ""boasting"" and ""laughing"" about prosecuting a homeless single mother for truancy in the speech. However, a closer examination of the speech reveals that Harris was actually discussing her anti-truancy program and the positive outcomes it achieved. The program aimed to reduce truancy rates by providing services and resources to parents, rather than prosecuting or jailing them. In the case of the homeless single mother, the program helped her find stable housing and get her children back in school. Harris was celebrating the success of the program in avoiding the need for prosecution or jail time for the mother. The article argues that it is a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the facts to claim that Harris was ""boasting"" about prosecuting parents or that she targeted a specific homeless mother for intimidation. While the threat of prosecution was a component of the anti-truancy program, its ultimate goal was to improve attendance and reduce the risk of future criminality for the children involved. The controversy surrounding the speech arose from a misunderstanding of the program's mechanics and purpose.

59,"### Context: The Great Salt Lake in Utah is experiencing record-low water levels due to years of below-average precipitation and record heat. Lawmakers recently visited the lake to witness the problems firsthand and explore ways to help. The lake is crucial to the state's economy and ecosystem, with an estimated economic effect of $1.32 billion. It is home to over 250 species of birds and is a source of salt and other minerals used for various purposes. The lake's shrinking water levels are threatening the ecosystem and the livelihood of brine flies and brine shrimp, which are harvested for their eggs. The low water levels stress the shrimp, resulting in fewer eggs and impacting the industry. Companies that rely on the lake, such as the Great Salt Lake Brine Shrimp Cooperative and Compass Minerals, are facing challenges due to the receding shoreline and the need to dredge the harbor and extend canals. Lawmakers have approved spending $1.5 million to dredge the lake and create a passable channel for boats. They are also considering efforts to remove an invasive weed that consumes a significant amount of water. Additionally, concerns have been raised about major water pipeline projects diverting fresh water from rivers that flow into the lake. The article emphasizes the urgency of addressing the lake's declining water levels and the need for stewardship and active involvement in preserving its ecosystem.

The rumor started with a video posted on a YouTube channel dedicated to Clinton conspiracy theories. The video shows a slow-motion close-up of Clinton's eyes while she spoke at an event in Philadelphia. Clinton did postpone a fundraising lunch planned in North Carolina, but no reason was given by her campaign. The notion that Clinton suffers from strabismus (crossed eyes) dates back to a head injury she suffered in 2012, but the video does not show any signs of strabismus. The video is zoomed in and plays in slow motion, making Clinton's eye movements appear strange. A full video of the speech shows that Clinton's eyes do not look unusual when played in real time. It is not clear why Clinton canceled her North Carolina fundraiser, but the video does not support the claim of ""bizarre eye movements.""

The shop's owners argue that they are state-licensed legitimate businessmen and should be allowed to operate like other businesses. Since the legalization of recreational marijuana in Washington state in 2012, many municipalities have passed laws restricting or banning the operation of pot shops. The opening of The Gallery has set up a potential showdown with authorities in Pierce County, where the shop is located. The county has visited the shop for inspections and advised the owners that they lack proper permitting. Noncompliance and cease-and-desist orders could be issued, resulting in daily fines of up to $1,000. The state's top lawyer has stated that local governments are allowed to ban pot businesses, but state regulators do not consider local laws in their review process for granting licenses. The owners of The Gallery argue that it is unfair to ban tightly regulated retail establishments while allowing medical pot businesses to operate unchecked. State lawmakers are considering proposals to license medical-use stores to ensure product safety and level the regulatory playing field. The opening of The Gallery could potentially embolden others to open in defiance of local bans or create positive publicity for the shop. The shop offers a variety of marijuana products and has a nondescript entrance. Patrons include individuals who use marijuana for relaxation and a former U.S. Army medic battling insomnia and anxiety.

62,"### Context: A new combination laser-ultrasound device has been developed that could potentially revolutionize laser-based dermatological procedures. The device aims to improve the safety and effectiveness of laser treatments for removing birthmarks, port-wine stains, and tattoos. However, the article highlights several concerns and limitations with the device and the claims made in the press release.

The article criticizes the lack of evidence and data to support the claims made in the press release. The researchers did not test the safety or clinical effectiveness of the device in the experiment highlighted in the release, making it premature to make claims of benefits. The level of risk presented by the new device is also not mentioned, despite safety concerns of existing laser devices being referenced.

The article also points out that the only result reported in the conference abstract and draft journal article is an increase in the amount of light that went through pig skin in the lab. There is no data presented about the actual ability of the device to remove birthmarks, port-wine stains, or tattoos. The lack of information about eye damage risk or skin heating, discoloration, or burning is also noted.

The article praises the inclusion of a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device itself. However, it is mentioned that commercialization of the device would benefit the careers of the researchers.

The article criticizes the lack of details about how the experimental device is better than existing dermatological lasers and the failure to mention other methods, such as applying glycerol or mechanical vibration, to improve laser light transmission through the skin. The confusion caused by the references to ""open-air transmission"" and ""sonoillumination"" is also highlighted.

Overall, the article concludes that the claims made in the press release are not supported by evidence and that the device is still in the early stages of development. Clinical trials have yet to be performed, and there is no support for the claim that the device will be available widely in the near future.
Claim: Laser-Based Dermatological Procedures Could Be Revolutionized with New Techniqu
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release claims that a device being developed at the University of Missouri could revolutionize treatment to remove tattoos, birth marks and port-wine stains based only on a test on some pig skin…and that pig didn’t even have any tattoos or other markings. The release quotes a researcher who hopes “the procedure will be available widely in the near future.” But there’s no evidence to support that statement either. While the release is peppered with claims that this device that combines laser light with ultrasound pulses will be safer and more effective, that’s not what the experiment tested. The researchers showed only that their device was able to push more laser light through a piece of pig skin than a conventional laser. Their assumption that increasing transmitted optical power will improve clinical effectiveness has yet to be tested. Neither benefits nor harms are put in numerical context. Alternatives are not mentioned. We applaud the release writers for including a link to a patent application, which provides more detail about the device and highlights potential benefits to the researchers. The release notes that the work was funded by a program to support commercialization of academic research. There are objective statements about research results, and then there are marketing statements in support of a product. This research was supported by a University of Missouri’s FastTrack grant. According to the university’s web site, such grants “are not to be used for basic research, but to evaluate the commercial potential of existing research.” But when journalists and others receive a news release from University of Missouri Health they should be able to trust that academic standards hold more sway than marketing interests.",Laser-Based Dermatological Procedures Could Be Revolutionized with New Techniqu,"The news release describes a new experimental device that uses ultrasound to improve the transmission of laser light through the skin.

The claim originated from a blog post titled ""Why I Kicked My Keurig to the Curb"" and has been circulating on alternative health and wellness websites since 2014. The author of the post implies that Keurig water reservoirs cannot be emptied, leading to the growth of mold and bacteria. However, when an ABC news affiliate tested three Keurig machines for mold and bacteria, the results showed that the inside of the machines were clean. The bacteria found on the outside of the machines were mostly from human touching. A microbiologist from Harrisburg University School of Science and Technology explained that the internal piping of Keurig machines cannot be cleaned or completely drained. While the water coming out of the machine was clean, there is a chance that bacteria or mold could seep into the coffee. However, this is true for other types of coffee makers and kitchen appliances as well. In fact, a study conducted in Spain found that potentially harmful bacteria grows in most types of coffee makers, but the coffee itself acts as an antibacterial agent. The study also found that coffee machines consistently reach temperatures of up to 96°C, which helps to kill bacteria. Therefore, while it is true that mold and bacteria can grow on Keurig coffee makers, the health risks and warnings associated with it have been overblown.

Most of the non-government participants had worked for talc companies, including Johnson & Johnson (J&J), and had served as expert witnesses and consultants for these companies. The symposium focused on witnesses for J&J in lawsuits alleging that their Baby Powder was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos. The article reveals that the FDA has a history of downplaying the risk of asbestos contamination in talc powders and cosmetics, despite concerns raised by outside experts and consumers. The agency has often relied on industry assurances and has not issued warnings or imposed safety standards.

The FDA has stated that its resources and authority to regulate the cosmetic industry are limited. The agency lacks the power to ensure the safety of cosmetics before they are sold or to force companies to recall products when potential hazards are discovered. The FDA has commissioned tests that found asbestos in talc-based cosmetics, including Johnson's Baby Powder, leading to a recall of 33,000 bottles. The agency now recognizes that there is no known safe level of asbestos.

The article also discusses the FDA's previous decisions regarding asbestos warnings on talc powders. In 1986, the FDA rejected a petition for an asbestos warning, stating that the quality of cosmetic talc had improved and that even when asbestos was present, the levels were too low to pose a health hazard. The FDA rejected another petition in 2014, stating that the science wasn't strong enough to support a cancer warning.

The FDA has faced criticism for its handling of talc safety concerns and its reliance on industry experts. The agency organized the ""Asbestos in Talc Symposium"" and invited industry consultants and witnesses, while excluding medical experts who had questioned the safety of talc powders. The symposium resulted in reports that embraced industry positions on what fibers should be counted as hazardous, which contradicts the views of other public health officials.

The article concludes by highlighting the need for the FDA to involve consumers and their advocates in the discussion on talc safety. The agency is under increasing pressure to ensure that talc powders and cosmetics are free from asbestos.

65,"### Context: According to a report by the Trust for America's Health, younger adults in the United States are not getting vaccinated against the flu at high rates. The report states that the most prevalent flu strain this season is H1N1, the same strain that caused the 2009 pandemic. The flu is now widespread in 35 states, with particularly high rates in 13 states in the South and Southwest. The report highlights the low vaccination rates among younger adults as a concern, as they are more at risk than usual for the effects of the H1N1 strain. 

The analysis found that overall, 45 percent of all Americans received a flu shot during the 2012-2013 season, a slight increase from the previous season. However, among adults aged 18-64, only 35.7 percent received a flu shot during that season. In comparison, 56.6 percent of children aged 6 months to 17 years and 66.2 percent of seniors aged 65 and older were vaccinated. 

The report also provides information on vaccination rates by state. Massachusetts had the highest vaccination rate at 57.5 percent, while Florida had the lowest at 34.1 percent. Only 12 states had vaccination rates of 50 percent or higher. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all Americans aged 6 months and older get vaccinated against the flu each year. However, the report highlights the need for increased vaccination rates among younger adults, who are currently not getting vaccinated at the same rates as other age groups.

This news comes after Gordon announced on Twitter that he was stepping away from football to focus on his mental health. He thanked the Patriots for their support and expressed his intention to work his way back. The Patriots team officials stated that they support Gordon in his efforts to focus on his health and that they will respect his decision.

Gordon has a history of suspensions by the NFL for drug policy violations, and he missed the entire 2015 and 2016 seasons. In a 2017 interview, he admitted to drinking or using marijuana before games throughout his career. He also revealed in a mini-documentary that he took Xanax, cocaine, marijuana, and other narcotics.

Despite his suspension, Gordon still has support from his teammates in the Patriots locker room. Special teams captain and receiver Matt Slater expressed his concern for Gordon as a person and said he would continue to support him. Safety Devin McCourty also emphasized that Gordon's well-being is more important than football.

New England officials had been working to help Gordon acclimate to the team's culture and had limited his interactions with reporters. Coach Bill Belichick praised Gordon's progress on the field, stating that he was learning the offensive system and developing chemistry with quarterback Tom Brady.

Gordon had previously expressed that he felt at home with the Patriots and appreciated the welcoming atmosphere. He credited the organization and facility for helping him settle in smoothly.

67,"### Context: The claim that ""half of all adults have a pre-existing condition"" is supported by various studies and estimates. The Affordable Care Act prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined five studies on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions and found estimates ranging from 20% to 66% of American adults potentially at risk. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also came up with a similar range of 19% to 50%. 

The Heritage Foundation notes that projections of the scope of the problem can be inaccurate, as the number of people who actually run into the problem of being denied coverage is not estimated. However, a limited analysis from the House Energy and Commerce Committee found that four of the country's largest private insurers denied coverage to one out of seven people based on pre-existing conditions during a three-year period. 

The Kaiser Family Foundation's monthly tracking polls reported that 49% of adults said they or a family member have a condition that triggers an issue with insurance companies. Within that group, about a fourth reported that coverage had been denied or higher premiums had been charged due to a pre-existing condition. While this survey is not a perfect fit with other studies, it does indicate that the problem is substantive and relatively widespread, although not as broad as the higher estimates in other studies. 

Overall, the claim that half of all adults have a pre-existing condition is supported by the range of estimates and studies. The mid-range estimate from the GAO of 32% is a significant fraction of the adult population.

The device is implanted in the eye and works by magnifying images onto the healthy parts of the retina, allowing patients to regain some of their lost vision. The article highlights the potential benefits of the procedure, stating that findings from clinical trials show that the telescope does improve vision for the majority of patients. However, there are concerns about corneal damage as the telescope is relatively large inside the eye. The treatment is not suitable for those who have had cataract surgery or for those who catch the disease early on. The article provides absolute numbers and percentages to explain the evidence, such as 75% of patients experiencing major improvements in their vision and 10 out of 219 patients experiencing corneal problems after the surgery. It also mentions that the vision improvement measurement method is not explained. The article mentions that while the procedure could potentially help millions of people globally, not all of them would be candidates for this surgery. It suggests that a more realistic number of potential beneficiaries should have been provided. The article heavily relies on the insights of Dr. George Williams, a retinal surgeon associated with the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and Dr. Kathryn A. Colby, one of the principal investigators in the study. It compares the new surgery to existing surgeries and drug treatments, explaining their procedures and effectiveness. The article suggests that the reporter should have included comments and context from at least one more source besides Dr. Williams. It mentions that the procedure is experimental and that the FDA plans to monitor side effects for five years, but it is unclear why the article was published now since the FDA approved the device at the beginning of the month. The availability of the procedure is also not made clear. The article concludes by stating that the procedure should be placed in the context of other devices that improve vision, although it does not provide further information on this. Overall, the article provides information on the potential benefits and concerns of the new surgical procedure involving a tiny eye telescope for macular degeneration.
Claim: Tiny Eye Telescope Brings Back A World Of Sight
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The story starts with a gee whiz hook but then gives readers the necessary context. It also uses independent voices, spends nearly as much time talking about the potential harms as the benefits and provides a solid exploration of the alternatives to surgery. Perhaps the best part of the story is the very end where it provides the audience with a clear message on what they should do with these study results. The short answer: get your vision checked because this is just one of many new ways you might be able to save or restore your eyesight. Everyone starts to lose some vision as they age, and macular degeneration, in particular, affects millions of people. This story serves as both a nice piece of hope for a subset of these people and as a reminder to everyone else that there are multiple ways to treat the disease.",Tiny Eye Telescope Brings Back A World Of Sight,This is a story about a new medical device that has been approved by the FDA for use in treating a common eye disease.

69,"### Context: An investigation by the Associated Press has found that millions of medical masks, gloves, gowns, and other supplies being used in hospitals across the US are counterfeit, putting lives at risk. The investigation discovered that a shipment of masks that arrived in late March, which were believed to be authentic, were actually counterfeits. The masks had ear loops instead of bands that stretch across the back of the head, which is a telltale sign of counterfeits. The masks were stamped as if approved by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had issued a warning the day before stating that all Shanghai Dasheng N95 masks with ear loops were counterfeit. The CDC has been in talks with Shanghai Dasheng about the authenticity issues. Shanghai Dasheng is one of the largest manufacturers of authentic N95 masks in the world and one of only a few in China certified to make NIOSH-approved, US medical-grade N95 masks. However, in the rush of the pandemic, cheaper masks are proliferating. The investigation also found that even for those looking out for fakes, it has been difficult to keep up with changing federal guidelines for medical-grade masks. The US Food and Drug Administration relaxed standards in March due to an acute shortage of N95 masks, but most newly arrived models were found to be substandard. As a result, millions of inadequate masks have entered the US and are now in use. State and local governments, hospitals, private caregivers, and well-wishers have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on these flawed masks. The article highlights the case of Direct Relief, an international humanitarian aid organization, which received a shipment of Shanghai Dasheng ear loop masks and initially believed they were the wrong model. However, after reading the CDC's warnings, they reported the masks as counterfeit. The investigation also reveals that some masks were purchased by charities or community members who held online fundraisers, and even healthcare professionals themselves were caught off guard by the counterfeit masks.

70,"### Context: London has implemented a ban on junk food advertisements on public transport in an effort to combat child obesity. Research conducted for Britain's parliament revealed that almost 40 percent of children aged 10 and 11 in London are overweight or obese. London Mayor Sadiq Khan stated that child obesity in the city is a ""ticking timebomb"" and that bold steps need to be taken to address the issue. The ban will target food retailers, such as McDonald's, that sell products high in fat, salt, or sugar. McDonald's has faced criticism in the past for allegedly encouraging unhealthy eating habits among children. In 2011, the company won a lawsuit in the US allowing it to continue including toys in Happy Meals. Coca Cola and Pepsi, as part of the American Beverage Association, also faced scrutiny in 2011 due to concerns about the health effects of sugar-sweetened drinks. Food and drink advertising contributed around £20 million ($27 million) to Transport for London's revenue in the 2016-17 financial year, with about two-thirds of this coming from high fat, salt, and sugar products. The National Centre for Social Research and Cancer Research UK found that advertising of unhealthy foods, especially when targeted at children, puts additional pressure on families when making food choices. The ban on junk food ads on public transport is part of the mayor's draft London Food Strategy and is similar to initiatives implemented in Amsterdam this year. Mayor Khan called on the government to join the fight against child obesity and emphasized his determination to help Londoners make healthy food choices for themselves and their children.

71,"### Context: California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. However, it appears that Newsom mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. According to figures provided by the Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention, the gun death rate in California dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013. This rate includes homicides, suicides, and accidental shooting deaths. The figures do not include data from 2014, 2015, and 2016. 

When looking specifically at the gun murder rate, California saw a larger drop of 65 percent from 1993 to 2014, according to a review of fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 compared to 1993. 

Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people. Since then, the rate has remained relatively flat. 

In conclusion, Newsom's claim that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since the 1990s is accurate but needs clarification. While the gun death rate dropped 56 percent, the gun murder rate dropped by a larger percentage of 65 percent. The statement is accurate, but it is important to note the distinction between the two rates.

Newsom’s overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws. We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated.

However, the claim is a misrepresentation of what O'Donnell actually said. In a radio interview, O'Donnell expressed her disagreement with two women who were criticizing a marathon runner's decision to run without wearing a tampon. O'Donnell compared their remarks to Donald Trump's misogynistic comments about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly. O'Donnell argued that such demeaning comments contribute to a wider ""war on women"" in America. She stated that women fought for abortion rights and equality, and now those rights are being taken away. O'Donnell emphasized that there is still shame associated with periods, particularly perpetuated by men. She expressed her frustration with people engaging in menstrual shaming and suggested that if she still had her period, she would write ""You're all assholes"" with her menstrual blood and smear it on some people's faces. However, the context of her remarks indicates that she was targeting those who engage in menstrual shaming, not specifically Christians or pro-life advocates.

73,"### Context: The article addresses claims that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to include abortion funding in the bill to combat the coronavirus. The claim originated from an anti-abortion website called ""Life News"" and was flagged by Facebook as potentially misleading. The claim was based on a report by the Daily Caller, which cited unnamed ""senior White House officials"" alleging that Pelosi tried to lobby for provisions that would set a precedent for health spending without protections outlined in the Hyde Amendment. The Hyde Amendment prohibits the federal government from covering the costs of abortions, except in rare cases. The concern raised was that the bill's original draft didn't explicitly include language to ensure that reimbursement of laboratory claims couldn't apply to abortion services, potentially creating a loophole for abortion service providers to be reimbursed with federal funds in the future. However, Pelosi's staff declined to comment on the matter. 

The article clarifies that the claim of Pelosi trying to include abortion funding in the bill is inaccurate. A ""manager's amendment"" was submitted on March 12, which stated that reimbursement funds could only be used for COVID-19 related costs and would be limited to uninsured individuals not eligible for other COVID-19 testing and services assistance included in the bill. The bill did not have any funding for abortion in it.

In summary, the claim that Nancy Pelosi was caught trying to include abortion funding in the bill to combat the coronavirus is unfounded. The concern raised was about the bill's language potentially creating a loophole for abortion service providers to be reimbursed with federal funds, but no draft of the legislation included funding for abortion.

In 1973, the Department of Justice sued the Trump Management Corporation, of which Donald Trump was president at the time, for racially biased housing policies that violated the Fair Housing Act. In 1989, Trump took out a full-page ad in the New York Daily News calling for the death penalty for the ""Central Park 5,"" a group of black teenagers accused of rape and assault. The Central Park 5 were later found to be innocent and released from prison. In a 1991 book written by a former Trump casino executive, Trump was accused of making racial slurs against black people. The book described a conversation in which Trump expressed dislike for a black financial executive and made derogatory comments about black people. Trump's business, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, also faced allegations of removing black dealers from tables at the request of a high roller, resulting in a $200,000 penalty. Therefore, the claim that Trump was never accused of racism before running for president is false.

75,"### Context: The claim that one out of three U.S. homeless men is a veteran is based on outdated data and is not entirely accurate. The claim originated from a statement made by Ericka Walmsley, a Texas Veterans Commission employment representative, who referred to a web page maintained by HelpUSA, a group that provides housing and support services for the homeless. The HelpUSA web page states that one out of every three homeless men on the street is a veteran. However, the data on the web page is from 1996 and does not indicate how the ratio was reached.

According to a report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), veterans accounted for 11 percent of the nation's sheltered homeless adults in 2009, down from 13 percent in 2007. The report also states that a check of homeless individuals, both in shelters and not, on one night in January 2009 suggests that 13 percent were veterans, compared to 15 percent in previous years. The report attributes homelessness among veterans to issues such as lack of affordable housing, inadequate income and savings, and the lingering effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse.

A speech by Eric Shinseki, the U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, estimates the number of homeless veterans at 107,000, down from 131,000 two years earlier and 250,000 a decade ago. However, the 1-in-3 ratio is considered outdated and not relevant by current data collection and reporting standards.

Experts agree that it is difficult to determine the exact number of homeless men who are veterans. While some caution that the claim is based on obsolete data, others argue that the 11 percent figure from the HUD report justifies the claim. The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, which advises President Barack Obama and Congress, considers the 107,000 count of homeless veterans to be a reasonable figure.

In conclusion, the claim that one out of three U.S. homeless men is a veteran is based on outdated data and is not entirely accurate. The most recent data suggests that veterans account for 11 percent of the nation's sheltered homeless adults.

76,"### Context: After a group of migrants attempted to breach the U.S. border at Tijuana, with some throwing rocks and border agents responding with tear gas, there were conflicting reports about injuries sustained during the incident. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan stated that there were no ""reported serious injuries on either side of the border."" However, President Donald Trump claimed that ""three Border Patrol people yesterday were very badly hurt through getting hit with rocks and stones."" The White House and the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to requests for clarification on the president's claim.

The incident occurred at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, the main border crossing between Tijuana and San Diego. Over 5,600 Central American migrants, who had traveled in caravans through Mexico, are currently housed in a Tijuana sports complex. Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum has declared a humanitarian crisis.

On November 25, during planned protests in Mexico, some migrants attempted to cross into the U.S. at the port of entry and then tried to enter through fencing along the border. The port of entry was temporarily closed, and the incident involved ""over 1,000 individuals who sought to enter the U.S. unlawfully in large groups,"" according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. McAleenan confirmed that some individuals threw rocks or other projectiles at U.S. border personnel, but no serious injuries were reported. Four agents were hit with rocks but were wearing protective gear and did not suffer serious injuries.

Video and images showed tear gas being used to disperse the crowds. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen thanked the officers and agents in San Ysidro for their professionalism and restraint in ensuring that no one was injured as they were attacked.

President Trump also claimed that there are ""over 500 people that are serious criminals and gang members"" among the migrants in the caravan. Nielsen echoed this statement, saying that there are ""over 600 convicted criminals traveling with the caravan flow."" However, there is no evidence to support either claim, and requests for more information from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have gone unanswered.

Trump also mentioned that the wall is being built, stating that the breach occurred in an area where the wall was not yet completed. However, the funding approved by Congress for the fiscal 2018 omnibus spending bill only includes money to replace existing fencing in San Diego, not the concrete wall Trump had promised during his campaign. The approved funding is a fraction of the $25 billion the president had requested.

77,"### Context: The claim states that there have been warnings about a computer virus disguised as a Hallmark postcard email, with McAfee or Norton identifying it as the most destructive ever. The claim also mentions that there were no new threats or viruses identified by McAfee or Norton in May 2017 when the warning began circulating again. 

The article confirms that warnings about a postcard virus have been circulating on social media since the early 2000s. These warnings claim that McAfee or Norton has identified the postcard virus, which is deemed as the most destructive ever. The virus is said to destroy hard drives and can send itself to everyone in the recipient's email address book. The earliest versions of these warnings date back to 2001.

The article mentions that there have been credible email postcard virus warning threats in the past. McAfee issued consumer virus alerts about a postcard phishing scam in 2005 and a postcard virus worm in 2001. The postcard warning seems to be based on the 2001 threat alert, which described a ""worm virus"" that could be spread via email and self-replicate.

The article also states that the postcard warning evolved over time. In 2007, the term ""postcard"" was used instead of ""a virtual card for you"" in the subject line. Some versions even used the phrase ""Hallmark postcard"" and included previously debunked warnings. These Hallmark postcard versions of the rumor went viral again in 2010 and 2017, but there were no credible threats at the time.

The article concludes that the claim is mostly fiction. While there were some virus warnings in the past that matched some aspects of the postcard virus warning, there were no new threats or viruses identified by McAfee or Norton in May 2017. However, it is always important to be vigilant about viruses spread via email and take steps to enhance email security, such as scanning attachments before downloading, avoiding emails from unfamiliar senders, and not providing personal information via email.

78,"### Context: The article discusses a new device called TBIcheck that claims to diagnose brain injuries with just a single drop of blood. The device is being developed by the University of Geneva and will be marketed by a company called ABCDx starting in 2019. The device measures the level of a protein called H-FABP and claims to be able to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one-third of patients. However, the rest of the patients would still need to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.

The article raises several concerns about the device. Firstly, it criticizes the news release for not discussing the cost of the device, which is important considering that CT scans, the standard way of diagnosing brain injuries, can cost over $1,000. It also questions whether insurance companies would be willing to cover the cost of the device if it does not improve outcomes.

The accuracy of the test is not described in the news release, and it is unclear if the test actually improves care in any way. The article also points out that important long-term outcomes such as disability and difficulty concentrating were not part of the study, so any claims made about these outcomes would be inappropriate.

The article also highlights the lack of information about potential harms of the test. It questions whether the test could miss an injury due to a false negative or lead to unnecessary follow-up tests and treatments due to a false positive result. The news release does not provide data on the accuracy of the test or explain what actions are taken as a result of the test.

Furthermore, the article notes that the test has not been studied in a randomized clinical trial, so there is no evidence that patients who use it would have better outcomes or reduced costs compared to current practices. The news release also fails to mention that another blood test to evaluate concussions has already been approved for marketing in the U.S.

Overall, the article raises concerns about the claims made in the news release and highlights the lack of evidence and information provided. It suggests that the benefits of the test may be exaggerated and that it is not clear if the test will actually improve outcomes for patients.

The goal is to avoid unnecessary medical exams and CT scans. The research behind the device, which is similar to a pregnancy stick test, was published in PLOS One. The news release relates that the test will be marketed next year and allows that the test is not 100% reliable. However, it oversimplifes how concussions are diagnosed, doesn’t give cost data, and relies on some sensational language. Most importantly, it skirts the lack of evidence that patients who use this device will have better outcomes or lower costs than those who don’t. We’d all like to see better ways to diagnose the millions of concussions that occur each year. But it’s a complicated business, and there’s danger in oversimplifying the clinical decision-making process as companies rush to market devices that haven’t been rigorously tested in clinical trials.

Gaza, which is under a blockade led by Israel, has reported 13 cases of coronavirus infection, all of whom are in quarantine facilities. However, officials are concerned that a shortage of critical equipment and medical supplies could lead to a rapid spread of the virus among the enclave's two million people. The health ministry has appealed to international organizations for testing kits, ventilators, and beds for intensive care units. Hamas, the ruling party in Gaza, has implemented measures such as closing schools, mosques, and wedding halls, as well as banning large street gatherings, but has not imposed a lockdown on the population. Israel, which controls movement in and out of Gaza, has linked any coronavirus aid it might offer to progress in recovering two Israeli soldiers lost during the 2014 war. Last week, Norway, which chairs a major donor group to the Palestinians, called for more funding to help prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

80,"### Context: An FDA advisory panel has voted in favor of approving Merck's blood clot-preventing drug, Vorapaxar, which would be sold under the brand name Zontivity. The panel voted 10-1 in favor of the drug, with results from a trial known as TRA 2P being described as ""robust"" and justifying approval for patients who had suffered a heart attack. However, the panel agreed with the company that the drug should not be used in patients with a history of stroke due to an increased risk of bleeding in the brain. Vorapaxar works by preventing blood cells from clumping together and forming clots in the arteries. The drug increased the overall risk of bleeding in clinical trials, but the risk did not outweigh the drug's benefit in patients who had not had a stroke. Merck has proposed that the drug's label urge caution when prescribing it for patients who weigh less than 60 kilograms, as the risk of bleeding appears to be higher in these patients. The panelists could not reach a consensus on how lower-weight patients should be treated. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Merck's drug is seen as addressing an unmet medical need, as each year about 190,000 Americans have a second heart-related event. Standard therapy to prevent a second episode often includes treatment with aspirin and Plavix, but Vorapaxar would be given in addition to standard treatment. Merck is now awaiting the FDA's final ruling on the drug.

81,"### Context: A new test may help predict the risk of recurrence for colon cancer patients, according to a study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. The test, called the ColoPrint, analyzes the genetic makeup of a tumor to determine the likelihood of it coming back after surgery. The study found that patients with a high-risk score on the test had a 50% chance of recurrence within three years, while those with a low-risk score had only a 10% chance. The test could potentially help doctors decide which patients would benefit from chemotherapy after surgery. However, the test is not yet available and its exact cost is unknown. The article mentions that the high cost of the test may not be worth the expense. It also points out that the test does not predict whether an individual would actually benefit from chemotherapy, which could lead some people to undergo unnecessary treatment. The article does not provide information on the baseline average risk of recurrence or the potential benefit in terms of improved survival. It also does not describe any potential harms of the test. The strength of the evidence supporting the use of the test is not discussed, and it is noted that the results presented at the meeting are not rigorously peer-reviewed. The article does not exaggerate the seriousness or prevalence of colon cancer and clearly states that the test is targeted towards colon cancers that are large but have not spread beyond the colon. Multiple experts are quoted in the article, suggesting that it does not solely rely on a press release for information. However, it is noted that the news release from the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting is driving the story, raising questions about the timing of the article before the actual presentation of results or publication of a peer-reviewed paper. Overall, the article provides an overview of the potential benefits and limitations of the test, but lacks certain details and context that could have been included.
Claim: Test may help predict colon cancer recurrence risk
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Whether to give chemotherapy after surgery for localized colon cancer is controversial. Chemotherapy has significant side effects and the survival benefit is small. As is currently done for breast cancer, to be able to predict whether the tumor is likely to return after surgery would help guide treatment decisions about chemotherapy. This story reports on new results on a gene test for colon cancer tumors to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. Unfortunately the new test was only modestly able to predict colon cancer recurrence and failed to predict response to chemotherapy. Future research is clearly needed. This story adequately represents the novelty and availability of the test. It does not engage in disease mongering and is clear on the target of the test – colon cancers that are large but have not spread beyond the colon. It quotes multiples sources and is clear to point out who is invested in the development of the test. The story could have been improved by describing what is currently done to determine need for chemotherapy (i.e. pathology and/or imaging tests), by providing the baseline average risk of recurrence as a comparison to the predicted risk from the  test, and by describing potential harms of the test. Finally, the story doesn’t really give any details on the current study or the overall strength of the evidence to support the use of the test. Although the story points out that the results will be presented at a meeting, it should have made the point that these studies are not rigorously peer-reviewed and evaluated prior to presentation, which makes it more difficult to evaluate the study at this time.",Test may help predict colon cancer recurrence risk,"This story reports on a new test that may help predict the risk of recurrence for colon cancer patients.

82,"### Context: The World Health Organization on Tuesday updated its treatment guidelines for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis, which together infect more than 200 million people every year. It’s the first such WHO update since 2003, partly due to low past budgets and priority levels, and growing scientific data. Medical officer Teodora Wi called gonorrhea a “very smart bug” that repeatedly adapts to new antibiotics. It can infect the genitals, rectum, and throat. Chlamydia can cause ailments like burning sensations while urinating. WHO says mother-to-child transmission of syphilis resulted in over 200,000 early fetal deaths, stillbirths or neo-natal deaths in 2012.

83,"### Context: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released six one-page ""decision tool"" documents that provide guidance on reopening schools, workplaces, camps, childcare centers, mass transit systems, and bars and restaurants. However, the CDC did not release a document for churches and other religious facilities, which was originally included in early versions of the guidance. The faith-related guidance was removed after the White House expressed concerns about the recommended restrictions. The Trump administration official also stated concerns about the government making specific dictates to places of worship. The CDC had drafted the reopening guidance over a month ago but it was initially shelved by the administration. The agency also prepared a longer, more extensive guidance document that has not been posted. This longer document would provide organizations with specific instructions on how to reopen while still limiting the spread of the virus. Some health experts and politicians have been pushing for the CDC to release as much guidance as possible to help businesses and organizations make informed decisions. The decision tools have undergone review and editing by federal officials, resulting in changes and the removal of certain language. The edited guidance provides more flexibility and includes phrases such as ""as feasible"" when recommending certain measures. The release of the guidance comes after the Trump administration issued a phased-in reopening plan on April 17. U.S. Senator Charles Schumer has called for the release of all the documents related to reopening, but a resolution to encourage their release was blocked by Republicans.

This claim is true. Three-quarters of receipts made from thermal paper are thought to contain bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupter that has been linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Environmental Research.
Claim: Some grocery store receipts contain chemicals linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers.

",true,"To determine the extent of BPA and its chemical cousin, bisphenol S (BPS), in thermal paper, a team of researchers from the University of Granada (UGR) analyzed more than 100 receipts and tickets collected from Brazil, Spain, and France — an admittedly small sample size. More than 90% of the receipts collected in the former two countries were shown to contain BPA, compared with about half of those obtained in France. However, many receipts in France contained higher concentrations of BPS, which may also impact the endocrine system.",Some grocery store receipts contain chemicals linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers.,"What's true: A 2019 study found that 75 percent of receipts made from thermal paper contained bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupter that has been linked to infertility and hormone-related cancers. What's false: The study did not find that all grocery store receipts contained BPA."
85,"### Context: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Adam Hasner released an internet ad attacking his GOP opponent George LeMieux by linking him to former governor Charlie Crist and President Barack Obama. The ad accuses LeMieux of defending Obama's stimulus package, fighting for taxpayer-funded bailout of Big Sugar, and being the architect of an Obama-style cap and trade plan for Florida. It also claims that LeMieux falsely attacked Marco Rubio and compared him to Obama. 

To fact-check these claims, the article examines a St. Petersburg Times article from November 2009, which Hasner's ad cited as the source for LeMieux comparing Rubio to Obama. At the time, LeMieux was supporting Crist over Rubio, who was still running as a Republican. LeMieux's comments were made in the context of criticizing Rubio for opposing stimulus money that Crist accepted. LeMieux argued that it was easy for Rubio to criticize when he was no longer in the legislature, just like Obama opposing the Iraq war when he wasn't in the Senate or White House. 

The article points out that LeMieux's comments were not comparing Rubio and Obama on a stance or issue but making a general point about candidates opposing something they didn't have to vote on. The ad fails to provide this context and misrepresents LeMieux's statement. 

Furthermore, the article highlights that LeMieux actually supported Rubio's campaign after Crist left the GOP. LeMieux hosted a fundraiser for Rubio, campaigned with him, and introduced him at events. He also endorsed Rubio and donated to his campaign. The ad fails to acknowledge LeMieux's support for Rubio, further undermining its claim. 

Lastly, the article notes that comparing Rubio, a Republican, to Obama, a Democrat, does not necessarily have to be negative. Some publications have referred to Rubio as the ""Republican Obama,"" and a conservative figure even praised Rubio's potential presidential run, noting that he would have more experience than Obama had when he ran for president. 

In conclusion, the article rates Hasner's claim that LeMieux ""even compared Marco Rubio to Barack Obama"" as Barely True. The ad misrepresents LeMieux's statement and fails to acknowledge his support for Rubio.

86,"### Context: In a landmark ruling, the Constitutional Court of South Korea has declared the country's ban on abortion unconstitutional. The court also ruled that a law making doctors liable to criminal charges for performing abortions with the woman's consent is also unconstitutional. The ban, which dates back to 1953, has not changed significantly since its implementation. The court's decision was supported by seven of the nine justices, while two dissented.

The ruling reflects a growing trend towards decriminalizing abortion in South Korea, as the number of criminal prosecutions for illegal abortions has decreased in recent years. In 2017, only eight new cases were prosecuted, compared to 24 in 2016. Of the 14 cases decided in lower courts in 2017, 10 postponed a ruling on the condition that no crime be committed for a fixed time.

A survey conducted by polling firm Realmeter showed that over 58 percent of South Korean respondents favored scrapping the ban, while just over 30 percent wanted it retained. The ruling has sparked dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse, highlighting the persistent divisions in public opinion on the issue.

The court's decision is seen as a victory for women's rights and the right to self-determination. A lawyer representing the plaintiff, a doctor charged with conducting 69 illegal abortions, stated that the ruling ""frees women from shackles."" Supporters of the ruling argue that it ensures pregnancy remains a personal choice.

The abortion ban will remain in effect until the end of 2020 to allow time for its revision. The government has stated that it will respect the court's decision and take steps to comply. The law currently prescribes jail time and fines for women who undergo abortions, as well as penalties for medical professionals who provide abortions at the woman's request.

Abortion numbers in South Korea have been declining, with 49,764 estimated cases in 2017, compared to 342,433 in 2005 and 168,738 in 2010. This decrease is attributed to the spread of birth control measures and a decline in the population of women in the reproductive age range.

President Moon Jae-in, a liberal, has not explicitly stated his position on the law but has called for further discussions to build consensus.

87,"### Context: The article discusses how Barack Obama voted ""present"" on seven votes involving abortion rights in the Illinois Legislature. The article explains that in the Illinois Legislature, members can vote ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""present,"" and a vote of ""present"" counts the same as a ""no."" The seven votes were on bills that sought to restrict abortion, including outlawing late-term procedures, requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortions, and implementing ""born alive"" legislation. Obama's defenders argue that his ""present"" votes were a tactical move to disrupt legislation that could be used against Democrats in swing districts. However, critics argue that he should have voted ""no"" on these bills and that his ""present"" votes allowed him and other Democrats to take political cover. The article also mentions that Obama has received positive ratings from organizations that promote abortion rights, including the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood. Clinton has also received endorsements from these organizations, but Obama has high-profile endorsements as well. The article concludes by stating that there are different interpretations of the significance of Obama's ""present"" votes, but it acknowledges that he did make them.

Story explains that those with fatal cancers were 63% less likely to have ever taken a statin, but then goes on to explain that “it’s also possible that statins don’t prevent certain cancers at all.” Good job briefly mentioning statin side effects of muscle pain, nausea, gas, and liver dysfunction. The story is very clear about the potential holes in the study results and what it would take to actually prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer. No disease mongering here. Ends with “Researchers agreed that until there’s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn’t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.” Important perspective added by independent expert from Duke who was not involved in the study. Final line of the story quotes an independent expert saying “that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.” The story states that about one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks.

89,"### Context: The claim that Jim Morrison has been found alive in Paris is false. The rumor was started by a fake news website called The Nevada County Scooper. The website published a report claiming that a Paris beat reporter named Belda Sauve broke the story after investigating Morrison's death for 45 years. The report stated that a nurse from an assisted living hospital for the infirmed contacted Sauve and informed her that she was caring for a patient named Jacques Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec who claimed to be the grandson of the famous French artist. The patient told stories of rock concerts, sexual orgies, and drug usage that seemed to match those in Morrison's biography. Sauve interviewed the patient and had conversations about various topics, but when she mentioned Pamela Courson, Morrison's soul mate, he became quiet. The story quickly spread on social media, but The Nevada County Scooper is a satirical website and not a credible news source.

There have been persistent questions about Jim Morrison's death, but there is no conclusive evidence to disprove that he died of heart failure in July 1971. In 2007, a former Paris nightclub manager claimed that Morrison actually died of a heroin overdose in a toilet stall of the club. Another theory is that Morrison mistook a pile of heroin for cocaine and died after snorting it. However, there is no hard evidence to support these theories. No autopsy was performed on Morrison, and Paris prosecutors have stated that it is unlikely that a new investigation into his cause of death will be opened.

90,"### Context: According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide is a global public health issue that affects all ages, sexes, and regions of the world. Hanging, poisoning, and shooting are the most common methods of suicide. The WHO urged governments to adopt suicide prevention plans to help people cope with stress and reduce access to suicide means. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 29, after road injury. Among teenage girls aged 15 to 19, it is the second biggest killer after maternal conditions, while in teenage boys, it ranks third behind road injury and interpersonal violence. Overall, close to 800,000 people die by suicide every year, surpassing the number of deaths caused by malaria, breast cancer, war, or homicide. Global suicide rates have fallen by 9.8% between 2010 and 2016, but the decline is not consistent across all regions. In the Americas region, suicide rates rose by 6% during the same period. The report also highlighted that in wealthy countries, nearly three times as many men as women die by suicide, while in low- and middle-income countries, the rates are more equal. The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, emphasized that suicides are preventable and called on all countries to incorporate proven suicide prevention strategies into national health and education programs. The report identified restricting access to pesticides as one of the most effective ways to reduce suicide numbers quickly. Pesticides are commonly used and highly toxic, often resulting in death, especially in remote areas where medical help is not readily available. The WHO cited studies in Sri Lanka, where bans on pesticides led to a 70% decrease in suicides and an estimated 93,000 lives saved between 1995 and 2015.

91,"### Context: The municipality of La Pintana in Chile has implemented a successful recycling program, despite being an impoverished area with high levels of poverty and crime. The program collects 140 tons of plant waste from homes every week, making it one of the highest rates in the country. The initiative has been praised for its level of penetration and effectiveness, with other municipalities being encouraged to replicate it. The program not only benefits the environment but also has economic advantages by reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills, which incur charges. The initiative was initially implemented in 2005 as a way to generate savings and reduce spending on waste management. The recycling process involves separating food waste, paper, and cardboard, which are collected by the municipality. The waste is then taken to a composting and vermiculture plant, where it is transformed into dark earth with the help of worms. This earth is used as fertilizer for a nearby municipal nursery, where trees are grown for the community's green areas. The nursery also conducts research on species that are best suited to climate change and dry weather. The success of La Pintana's recycling program has brought the community together, with residents not only discussing environmental issues but also social problems and concerns. The program has been recognized as a positive aspect of the community, which has historically been neglected by the state and lacks essential services and infrastructure. Chile, as a whole, is striving to implement further environmental initiatives, including reducing single-use plastics, cutting emissions, and increasing recycling rates. The country is already considered an environmental leader in Latin America due to its use of renewable energy and creation of national parks. The success of La Pintana's recycling program serves as an example for other municipalities and contributes to Chile's efforts to address climate change.

92,"### Context: The claim suggests that there is a canine coronavirus vaccine that has been around for years, questioning why a vaccine for humans hasn't been developed. However, this claim is misleading. The canine coronavirus vaccine is not for COVID-19 and is only for dogs, not humans.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, was discovered in 2019 and had not been previously identified in humans. Therefore, no vaccine for it could have been developed before that. The vaccine in the photo shared on Facebook is real, but it is for canine coronavirus disease (CCoV), not COVID-19. Merck Animal Health manufactures the vaccine and clarifies on its webpage that CCoV is not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19.

Canine coronavirus is a highly infectious intestinal infection in dogs, especially puppies. It is part of the Coronaviridae family, which includes various types of coronaviruses that affect different animal species, including humans. However, CCoV does not affect people and causes gastrointestinal problems in dogs, not respiratory disease.

VCA Animal Hospitals, a network of nearly 800 animal hospitals in the U.S., confirms that CCoV is not the same virus as SARS-CoV-2. They emphasize that the canine coronavirus vaccine is for preventing gastrointestinal issues in dogs, not for preventing COVID-19 in humans.

In summary, the claim that the existence of a canine coronavirus vaccine casts doubt on the absence of a vaccine for humans is incorrect. The canine coronavirus vaccine is not for COVID-19 and is only intended for dogs to prevent gastrointestinal problems. The development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, was not possible before its discovery in 2019.

93,"### Context: A study conducted by researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has shown promising results for a new gel that could help prevent the transmission of HIV in women. The gel contains the drug tenofovir, which is already used to treat HIV, and is the first potential microbicide to use a licensed AIDS drug. The study involved 200 sexually active HIV-negative women in the United States and India.

The researchers found that the gel was safe to use and well tolerated by the women. This is an important finding as it sets the stage for larger studies to determine if tenofovir can effectively prevent HIV infection. The gel was found to be acceptable to women, with 80% of those instructed to use it within two hours of having sex reporting that they had done so. Additionally, 12% of the women said that the gel made sex more pleasurable, while none reported that it made sex less pleasurable.

Microbicides are products, such as gels or creams, that can be applied vaginally or anally to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, previous studies have shown mixed results, with some microbicides not protecting women from infection and others actually increasing the risk of infection. The tenofovir gel appears to be a safe option, according to the researchers.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and was a phase II clinical trial designed to assess the safety of the gel, not its effectiveness. However, the researchers believe that these findings are a step in the right direction for HIV prevention. Women make up 46% of the 33.2 million people infected with the AIDS virus, making it crucial to develop effective prevention options for them.

One potential concern raised by the researchers is the duration of tenofovir in a woman's vagina. While it is not clear how long the drug stays in the vagina, there are encouraging studies suggesting that even when it is gone, the drug remains in the vaginal tissue.

Overall, the study provides hope for the field of microbicides and the prevention of HIV transmission in women. The next step will be larger studies to determine the effectiveness of tenofovir in preventing HIV infection.

94,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Heidi Heilman, director of New England field development for Smart Approaches to Marijuana and president of the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, that today's marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than in the past. The article examines the validity of this claim by analyzing data from various sources.

The article first mentions that the potency of marijuana has increased over time and that Heilman's claim is more specific than previous statements made about the potency of marijuana. To investigate the claim, the article looks at a graph provided by Heilman that shows the ratio of THC in marijuana from 1960 to 2011. The graph indicates that THC levels have increased by 5,700 percent, which is well outside the range cited by Heilman.

However, the article questions the reliability of the graph as it is based on a study published in 2010 that only covers a 16-year period ending in 2008. The study found that THC concentrations had risen by about 171 percent during that time, which is below the 300 to 800 percent increase mentioned by Heilman.

To further investigate, the article contacts the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, who refer them to the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi. The researchers at Ole Miss provide reports and test results that confirm Heilman's claim. The data shows that in 2012, the average THC concentration in marijuana was 12.3 percent, which is 300 percent higher than 1992 levels and 800 percent higher than the average level in 1976.

The article concludes that long-term testing supports Heilman's claim that today's marijuana is three times more potent than pre-1993 marijuana and eight times more potent than marijuana seized in 1976 and earlier. The highest THC content recorded was 37.2 percent.

In summary, the article confirms Heilman's claim that today's marijuana is 300 percent to 800 percent more potent than in the past, based on data from the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi.

The article highlights the importance of a healthy diet and the benefits of consuming more fiber, such as reducing the risk of obesity, chronic inflammation, heart disease, and cancer. However, it also mentions that many healthy sources of dietary fiber may be unaffordable or unavailable to young women from low-income backgrounds living in food deserts. The article suggests that journalists should press their sources to provide absolute risk numbers to help readers understand the impact of changing dietary behaviors. The study does not report absolute risks, but it is possible to calculate them based on the data provided. The article also mentions that increasing dietary fiber consumption is just one mechanism to reduce breast cancer risk, and other factors such as exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, getting sufficient sleep, and limiting alcohol consumption can also help. The article does not address conflicts of interest, but there do not appear to be any conflicts of interest to report. The study is not the first to examine the link between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, but there is no discussion of previous research in the article. Overall, the article provides valuable perspective from multiple independent sources and emphasizes the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle in reducing the risk of breast cancer.
Claim: Teen eating habits may help cut breast cancer risk
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story focuses on a recent study from the journal Pediatrics, which found that women who ate more dietary fiber during adolescence and young adulthood had a lower risk of developing breast cancer. The story does a nice job of addressing the strengths and weaknesses of the study — as does a competing story we reviewed from NPR. However, as with the NPR story, this story would have been even better if it had explained that the 16% lower risk of cancer was a relative risk reduction, and that the absolute difference was a mere 0.2 percentage point. Moreover, the story would have been improved by the use of more appropriate language in the headline — this type of study can’t tell us whether fiber “may help cut breast cancer risk,” and the story should’ve reflected that uncertainty in its headline description. According to the CDC, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, with more than 224,000 new cases reported in 2012 alone. Findings that early life experiences (diet and behavior) affect later chance of malignancy and heart disease are beginning to emerge. This should be intuitive, but is hard to show in studies because of the very long periods between the early life experiences and later health outcomes.",Teen eating habits may help cut breast cancer risk,"This is a story about a study that found a link between a high-fiber diet in adolescence and a lower risk of breast cancer. The story does a good job of explaining the study and the limitations of the study. The story also does a good job of explaining the benefits of a high-fiber diet. However, the story does not address the costs of a high-fiber diet, which is a significant issue. A high-fiber diet is a healthy diet, but it can be expensive.

This has caused outrage among allies such as France and Germany. The competition for medical supplies has intensified as the global cases of COVID-19 surpass one million and the outbreak explodes in the United States. President Donald Trump has recommended that Americans wear cloth face coverings, but the guidance does not recommend wearing medical-grade masks. The White House has ordered multinational company 3M to stop all shipments to Canada and Latin America of respirators manufactured in the United States, despite the ""significant humanitarian implications"" of this decision. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized this move, warning that it could backfire as Canadian healthcare professionals go to work in the United States every day. In another incident, an order of 200,000 masks bound for Germany from a 3M factory in China were confiscated in Bangkok, leading to accusations of ""modern piracy."" A U.S. Department of Homeland Security official has revealed that the United States has been paying above market price for much of the gear purchased overseas and will continue to do so until they have an excess supply. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has acknowledged that disasters often lead to price increases for essential commodities. In Brazil, China reportedly ditched some Brazilian equipment orders when the United States sent cargo planes to buy the same products. Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that many of their purchases were dropped, but Brazil has finally succeeded in placing an order for equipment. In France, regional leaders have reported that the United States is outbidding them for mask orders, paying three or four times the market price.

97,"### Context: The article discusses a Russian reality show called ""Game2: Winter"" that allegedly allows contestants to commit crimes, including rape and murder. However, it is important to note that the show's rules state that all crimes committed on the show are prosecutable, and contestants who commit crimes will be arrested. The contestants are required to sign a waiver acknowledging that they may not survive the nine-month Siberian wilderness challenge and that they could be maimed or killed. The show is set to begin on July 1, 2017, and run through April 1, 2018, with 24/7 coverage worldwide. The show's creator, Yevgeny Pyatkovsky, is investing 1 billion rubles ($16.2 million) in the series, which will be aired in multiple languages. As of November 18, 2016, there were already 32 people who had signed up to participate, including one American. The show has received criticism for its controversial concept, but Pyatkovsky has stated that all potential contestants sign waivers acknowledging the risks involved. The Siberian Times has reported on the show, citing a July 1, 2017 start date for pre-filming activities. However, it is important to note that the show's creator has stated that they will not be responsible for any claims made by participants, even if they are killed or raped. The show aims to test contestants' survival skills in the harsh Siberian taiga, where temperatures can reach as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius.

98,"### Context: Wildfires continue to ravage Australia, with firefighters battling flames fueled by strong winds and lightning strikes in New South Wales and Victoria. However, conditions were milder on Saturday and are expected to remain relatively benign for the next week. Authorities are assessing the damage, and while there were some injuries, officials are relieved that the fires were not more destructive overnight. One man suffered serious burns while protecting a home and was airlifted to a hospital in Sydney for surgery. Several firefighters also sustained minor burns and one experienced shortness of breath, but they did not require hospitalization.

The article highlights that a massive blaze, covering an area of 640,000 hectares, is expected to burn for weeks as heavy rain is not forecasted. Since September, the fire crisis in Australia has claimed the lives of at least 26 people, destroyed over 2,000 homes, and scorched an area larger than the U.S. state of Indiana. The government has faced criticism for its response to the fires, with accusations that it needs to take more action to counter climate change, which experts believe has exacerbated the situation.

Protests took place in Sydney and Melbourne, with demonstrators calling for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to be fired and for Australia to take stronger action on global warming. The protesters carried placards expressing their frustration with the government's negligence and the devastating impact of the wildfires on the environment and air quality.

The article also features the story of Evan Harris, a resident of Burragate in New South Wales, who chose to stay and defend his home despite evacuation orders. Harris lives off the grid in a remote cottage made from mud bricks, using batteries for electricity and a small wood burner for heating water. He believes that if his house survives, it will serve as a wake-up call for people to adopt more sustainable building practices instead of constructing extravagant homes.

Harris emphasizes the importance of paying attention to the more sustainable ways in which indigenous Australians previously lived and criticizes the human species for demanding too much from the environment, resulting in the current wildfires.

Overall, the article provides an update on the ongoing wildfires in Australia, the damage caused, and the public's response to the government's handling of the crisis.

99,"### Context: The claim that the American ambassador in Libya was raped and murdered during an attack on the U.S. Consulate is not supported by the information provided in the article. The article states that Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed when a mob attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Ambassador Stevens was raped before being killed.

According to U.S. news accounts, Ambassador Stevens was alive when brought to a hospital and died of smoke inhalation from the fire started in the attack on the consulate. The article also mentions that an image circulated purporting to show Ambassador Stevens in the hands of his killers, but the authenticity of the image is not confirmed.

The chaos of the attack is described, with a video showing Libyans attempting to rescue a still-alive Stevens from the burned-out consulate building. The video does not provide evidence of rape or murder, but rather shows the efforts to save the ambassador's life.

The circumstances of Ambassador Stevens' death are still under investigation, and the FBI has opened an inquiry into the attack and the deaths of the three individuals. An autopsy will be carried out to determine the cause of death.

In summary, the claim that the American ambassador in Libya was raped and murdered during the attack on the U.S. Consulate is not supported by the information provided in the article. The article states that Ambassador Stevens died of smoke inhalation and there is no evidence to suggest that he was sexually assaulted before being killed.

100,"### Context: A study conducted by researchers from the University of Essex has found that engaging in a ""green activity"" such as walking, gardening, cycling, or farming for as little as five minutes can improve mood and self-esteem. The study, led by Jules Pretty and Jo Barton, aimed to determine how much time needed to be spent on outdoor exercise for the benefits to show. The researchers analyzed data from 1,252 individuals of different ages, genders, and mental health statuses taken from 10 existing studies in Britain. Activities such as walking, gardening, cycling, fishing, boating, horse-riding, and farming were considered. The study found that the greatest health changes were observed in the young and mentally ill, but people of all ages and social groups benefited. The largest positive effect on self-esteem was seen after a five-minute dose of ""green exercise."" All natural environments, including parks in towns or cities, were found to be beneficial, but green areas with water had a more positive effect. The researchers believe that there would be significant benefits to individuals, society, and healthcare costs if more people engaged in green exercise as a form of self-medication. Outdoor exercise has been shown in many studies to reduce the risk of mental illness and improve overall well-being. However, until now, the specific amount of time required for these benefits was unknown. This study provides evidence that even a short duration of green activity can have a positive impact on mental health and self-esteem.

101,"### Context: Malawi has become the first country to immunize children against malaria. The vaccine, known as Mosquirix, was developed by GlaxoSmithKline and was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2015. Although the vaccine only protects about one-third of children who are immunized, those who receive the shots are likely to have less severe cases of malaria. The parasitic disease kills about 435,000 people every year, with the majority being children under 5 in Africa.

Pedro Alonso, director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) malaria program, stated that similar vaccination programs will begin in Kenya and Ghana in the coming weeks, with the aim of reaching about 360,000 children per year across the three countries. Alonso acknowledged that the vaccine is flawed but emphasized that the world cannot wait for a better option, as progress against malaria has stalled. Resistance to malaria medicines is growing, mosquitoes are becoming more resistant to insecticides, and funding for malaria efforts has plateaued.

The vaccine was found to be about 30% effective in children who received four doses, but the protection waned over time. Reported side effects include pain, fever, and convulsions. GSK, the developer of the vaccine, is donating up to 10 million vaccine doses in the current vaccination initiatives and is working with partners to secure funding for potentially broader vaccination programs.

Some experts have raised concerns that the vaccination programs should not divert limited public health funds from other proven tools to curb malaria, such as bed nets and insecticides. However, others believe that the vaccine, despite its imperfections, will save many lives and could kick-start further research efforts.

One of the challenges health officials may face is convincing parents to bring their children for repeated doses of a vaccine that only protects about a third of children for a limited amount of time. Unlike more commonly used vaccines, such as those for polio and measles, which work more than 90% of the time, the malaria vaccine has lower efficacy.

In conclusion, the vaccination program in Malawi marks a significant milestone in the fight against malaria. While the vaccine is imperfect and has limited efficacy, it has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives, particularly by reducing the severity of malaria cases. The rollout of similar vaccination programs in Kenya and Ghana is expected to follow, aiming to reach a significant number of children in these countries.

102,"### Context: A jury in New Brunswick, New Jersey has rejected claims by Rosalind Henry and her husband that her mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure, was caused by Johnson & Johnson's talc products. The company is currently facing over 10,600 liability lawsuits across the United States regarding its talc products, with most claims alleging that they caused ovarian cancer and that the company concealed the associated risks. Johnson & Johnson, based near the courtroom where the case took place, expressed satisfaction with the unanimous jury verdict and stated that its talc has been extensively tested and found to be safe and asbestos-free. Henry's lawyers argued during the trial that the company had known about asbestos fibers in its talc for decades but concealed the evidence from regulators and consumers.

Johnson & Johnson has been involved in talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but recently the litigation has expanded to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim that asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. The company lost its first trial over these allegations in April, with a jury awarding $117 million to a man suffering from mesothelioma and his wife. Another trial in May resulted in a $25.7 million award to a woman diagnosed with mesothelioma. Both decisions are currently being appealed. Since then, there have been four mistrials in similar cases due to jurors being unable to reach a verdict or because the plaintiff passed away. In July, a Missouri jury delivered a massive $4.69 billion verdict against Johnson & Johnson in the first trial alleging that asbestos contamination caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. This decision is also under appeal.

Overall, the jury's verdict in the New Jersey talc cancer case is a win for Johnson & Johnson, as it continues to face numerous lawsuits across the country. The company maintains that its talc products are safe and free of asbestos, despite the allegations made by plaintiffs.

103,"### Context: The article titled ""Prozac Failed Anorexic Women in Study"" discusses a study that examined the effectiveness of fluoxetine (Prozac) in treating anorexia. The article highlights several important points related to the claim.

Firstly, the article mentions that the study did not show any statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving fluoxetine and the placebo group. This means that there was no apparent benefit from using fluoxetine to treat anorexia.

The article also notes that the study was conducted on patients who had been suffering from anorexia for an average of four years and were recruited from eating disorders treatment centers. This suggests that the results may not be generalizable to patients at earlier stages of anorexia or those who are less acutely affected.

Furthermore, the article mentions that only a small number of patients completed the study, raising questions about the reliability and generalizability of the findings. It also highlights that one teenage study participant attempted suicide, which has been linked to certain antidepressant medications, including fluoxetine.

The article points out that the study did not list any negative side effects of fluoxetine, but it argues that it is still important to discuss potential harms and side effects in a balanced story. It also mentions that the lead author of the study receives funding from Eli Lily, the maker of fluoxetine, and that the company provided medication for the study. This potential conflict of interest should be taken into consideration.

Additionally, the article mentions that fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of bulimia, but not anorexia. Its use in clinical settings for anorexia is off-label and typically for co-existing depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The article emphasizes that fluoxetine has been effective in treating symptoms of bulimia nervosa, but not anorexia.

The article provides prevalence statistics from The National Eating Disorders Association and includes information from researchers and clinicians not affiliated with the study. It also mentions that the study participants received psychotherapy in addition to medication.

Overall, the article highlights the lack of effectiveness of fluoxetine in treating anorexia, the limitations of the study, potential side effects, and the off-label use of the medication. It emphasizes the need for a balanced discussion of the topic and raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest.
Claim: Prozac Failed Anorexic Women in Study
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story reports the results of a small study of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Fluoxetine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of bulimia nervosa; evidence for fluoxetine as a treatment for anorexia is less clear, and results from this study suggest no apparent benefit. The story mentions that fluoxetine is â€œoften used to treat anorexiaâ€, but this is an off-label use, which is not mentioned. It’s an important fact to include. The medication is more commonly prescribed for anorexic patients to treat depression and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder, common co-existing mental illnesses in these patients. The story partially describes the study design, but does not mention it was a double-blind, randomized study. The story provides absolute numbers of patients who completed the year-long study and maintained their weight. The story also appropriately notes that the difference in weight maintenance and time to relapse between the fluoxetine group and placebo group was not statistically significant. This was a small study, with less than half of the patients completing treatment, so the results may not be generalizable, especially for patients at earlier and less acute stages of anorexia. The patients in this study were recruited from eating disorders treatment centers and had been suffering with anorexia for several years (average was 4 years). The story mentions that one teenage study participant attempted suicide. Adolescent suicide has been linked to certain anti-depressant medications, including fluoxetine. No other harms or side effects of the drug are mentioned. Even though the source journal article did not list negative side effects of fluoxetine, that doesn’t remove the obligation to discuss these as part of a complete and balanced story. Lastly, the story provides several sources of information from researchers and clinicians not affiliated with the study to provide perspective on this study and the available treatment options for anorexia, a mental illness that some consider treatment-resistant. The story mentions behavioral treatments for anorexia, which have been somewhat effective, and notes that the study participants received psychotherapy (in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy) and medication.",Prozac Failed Anorexic Women in Study,"This is a story about a small, short-term study of the use of fluoxetine (Prozac) in the treatment of anorexia.

We appreciated the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) thresholds for clinical response and remission, the subjects’ baseline CDAI scores, and the explanation of what a 100-point drop feels like to patients. Bravo for including these points and for mentioning that the study met its ‘primary goal.’ Great facts for readers to consider that are often left out of news coverage.

106,"### Context: The article discusses the final trial results of an Ebola vaccine and its effectiveness in providing protection against the disease. The news release does not mention the cost of the vaccine, which is important, especially in developing countries where it is likely to be used in large quantities. The study found that among participants who were vaccinated immediately, no Ebola cases were identified 10 days or more after vaccination, compared to 23 cases among individuals who were assigned to delayed vaccination. The data also suggested that the vaccine reduced Ebola risks for unvaccinated individuals in contact with vaccinated individuals, but further research is needed to confirm this ""herd immunity"" effect. The release could have explained more clearly that the vaccine does not affect the virus during the 10-day incubation period. However, the fact that both the vaccinated and delayed vaccination groups had equal numbers of cases during this period suggests that the two groups were equally exposed to the virus. The release accurately quantifies the side effects of the vaccine, including mild symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and muscle pain, as well as two serious negative reactions and a flu-like illness that may have been caused by the vaccine. The study involved 5,837 people who received the vaccine and 6,004 who did not, and no patients in the vaccination group developed Ebola, indicating the vaccine's effectiveness. The statistical significance of the results suggests that the outcome was unlikely to occur by chance alone. However, the fact that the study was stopped early raises the possibility that a longer study may have found a smaller difference between the two groups. The news release acknowledges the seriousness of Ebola but does not sensationalize the risks. It also identifies the funding sources for the study and the organizations associated with the research team. The release briefly mentions another Ebola vaccine candidate being developed by a Chinese organization, which showed declining effectiveness after six months. The news release provides detailed information about the next steps in the vaccine approval process and the commitment of the manufacturer, Merck, to make doses available in case of an outbreak before approval is gained. It also mentions that no other Ebola vaccine is currently available and summarizes the results of a trial of an alternative vaccine. The release does not use sensational language but the statement about the dramatic effect of the vaccine suggests that it may be too good to be true.
Claim: Final trial results confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This news release discusses the results of a World Health Organization-led study of an experimental Ebola vaccine manufactured by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme. The study tested the effectiveness of the vaccine (currently referred to as rVSV-ZEBOV) among individuals who had come in contact with people diagnosed with Ebola within three weeks prior to the diagnosis, including contacts of those contacts, using a “ring vaccination” approach similar to that used to fight smallpox in the mid- to late 20th century. Among the 5,837 individuals who were vaccinated immediately after assignment to the study, none developed Ebola 10 days or more after being enrolled. In comparison, there were 23 Ebola cases identified 10 days or more in the group of 4,507 assigned to either a delayed vaccination (16 cases) or no vaccination (7 cases). The release delivers a good description of harms, is written in a balanced and non-sensational tone, and provides an overview of next steps for the vaccine. The release would have been improved with some reference to cost and the other Ebola vaccines under development by major pharmaceutical competitors. Health organizations worldwide have been scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Ebola since the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa which killed more than 11,300 people. Merck received “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” status in 2016 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and “PRIME” status from the European Medicines Agency for this closely watched vaccine. The “breakthrough” and PRIME status speeds up the review process for the vaccine once it is submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and/or the European Medicines Agency for approval.",Final trial results confirm Ebola vaccine provides high protection against disease,"This news release from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) describes the results of a large clinical trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, which is being developed by Merck.

107,"### Context: The article discusses a news release that claims to show the reversal of memory loss in Alzheimer's patients through a complex intervention. However, the article highlights several issues with the news release.

Firstly, the cost of the intervention and genetic testing for Alzheimer's is not discussed, making it difficult to assess the feasibility of the protocol. The news release mentions various interventions such as diet, brain stimulation, exercise, pharmaceuticals, and vitamins, but does not provide specific details or the total number of patients enrolled in the study.

The news release only provides information about three patients who had the most dramatic improvements, without mentioning the rest of the participants or any potential drop-outs. The self-reported improvements by the patients may be biased by their expectations of benefit from the program.

The news release also fails to mention any potential risks associated with the protocol, as well as the unknown duration of observed improvements. It acknowledges that the study is small and needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites.

The protocol involves 36 potential interventions, making it difficult to conduct a rigorous clinical trial. The news release suggests that the protocol can transform Alzheimer's disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition, which may be an exaggeration.

The funding sources for the study are not fully disclosed, and the researcher stands to benefit from sales of a book about the program. The news release also fails to acknowledge that previous single-drug therapies for Alzheimer's have been unsuccessful.

While some interventions in the protocol may be readily available, the intensiveness of the approach may make it financially and logistically challenging for most people.

Overall, the article concludes that the news release is unsatisfactory and misleading, as it implies that the protocol can reverse memory loss in Alzheimer's patients based on limited evidence from a small, uncontrolled study.
Claim: Pre and Post Testing Show Reversal of Memory Loss From Alzheimer’s Disease in Ten Patients
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This is a news release about an update of a small 2014 study on a program to reverse cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The program includes as many as 36 interventions which must be followed. Right out of the starting gate the release misinforms by using the terms mild cognitive impairment, subjective cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease interchangeably. They are not the same. The study reports “unprecedented” improvement in 10 patients with “early Alzheimer’s (AD) or its precursors” who adhered to the protocol, dubbed “metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration,” or MEND, for five to 24 months. All but one of the patients had genes (APOE) associated with Alzheimer’s. The news release provides data on just three of the cases in the study and does not discuss costs or potential challenges of adhering to this protocol. The news release reveals that the developer of the program, University of California, Los Angeles neurology professor Dale Bredesen, M.D., has a deal to publish a book for lay readers in 2017. Moreover, researchers say their findings are strong enough to warrant widespread genetic testing so those at risk for the disease can receive preventive measures. The book deal and the recommendation of genetic testing are troubling since there are just a handful of case studies to back up the program. Bredesen himself is quoted in the news release acknowledging the need for large-scale clinical trials. But the minor use of cautious language in describing the study as “small” and the call for future larger trials do not make up for the intentional muddying of the symptoms of age-related memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease. As the news release points out, Alzheimer’s disease is a huge and growing problem, affecting 5.4 million Americans and creating an economic burden on the health care system. No medications are available to stop its progress. There’s evidence that non-drug interventions that are designed to fight inflammation and improve blood sugar regulation like those in the MEND program could be effective. The MEND program includes the elimination of processed foods, regular exercise, yoga and medication to reduce stress, melatonin to extend sleep, supplements such as fish oil, vitamins D3 and B12, and hormone replacement therapy. However, the MEND treatment protocol involves so many factors it may be difficult to determine which ones are effective. To date nothing has been proven to prevent Alzheimer’s. Medications are available but they are expensive, may delay progression marginally, and have side effects.",Pre and Post Testing Show Reversal of Memory Loss From Alzheimer’s Disease in Ten Patients,"This news release describes a complex intervention program that was developed to treat a single patient with Alzheimer’s disease. The program includes 36 different interventions, ranging from dietary changes to brain stimulation to vitamin supplementation. The release claims that the program has been shown to reverse memory loss in 10 patients. However, the release does not provide any quantification of the benefits of the intervention, and it does not mention any potential harms. The release also does not provide any information about the study design, the quality of the evidence, or the costs of the intervention. The release is also misleading in that it implies that the intervention can reverse memory loss in all Alzheimer’s patients, when in fact the study only involved 10 patients. The release does not mention that the study was uncontrolled, and it does not acknowledge that the study was small and needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites. The release also does not mention that the study was funded by the same researcher who stands to benefit from sales of a book about the program. The release does not provide any context about the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, and it does not mention that the study was conducted by a single researcher. The release also does not mention that previous single-drug therapies for Alzheimer’s have been unsuccessful. Overall, the release is unsatisfactory and misleading."
108,"### Context: The town of Paradise in California faced the devastating Camp Fire, one of several recent ""megafires"" fueled by drought, erratic winds, and overgrown forests. The fire moved at an unprecedented speed, making the town's evacuation plans ineffective. The town attempted a staggered evacuation using their CodeRED alert system, but due to power outages and network congestion, only about 60 percent of the alerts were delivered. Additionally, only 25 to 50 percent of residents had signed up for the system, meaning that at best, only 30 percent of households received alerts. As a result, officials abandoned the phased evacuation and told everyone to evacuate immediately. Some residents criticized the town's alert system, suggesting that an old-fashioned siren system would have been more effective. Despite efforts to widen and pave roads after a previous fire in 2008, the Camp Fire burned across all escape routes, rendering the flow plan ineffective. The fire moved faster than expected, throwing embers up to 2 miles ahead of the flames. The mayor of Paradise stated that it would be nearly impossible for any city or town to evacuate their entire population simultaneously without overwhelming their roadway structure. Residents fought to escape the town, with some loading patients into their own vehicles when ambulances were not available. Firefighters and volunteers faced difficulties entering the town due to contraflows set up by the police to speed up the evacuation. One resident credited his decision to buy cattle after the 2008 fire, as they grazed on grass that would have otherwise fueled the fire. One of the key lessons learned from the Camp Fire was that residents facing a megafire might be better off sheltering in open spaces, such as road intersections, rather than trying to outrun the flames.

109,"### Context: The article discusses the use of hip resurfacing as a treatment for hip arthritis in relatively young individuals. It mentions that the implant alone costs significantly more than a traditional hip implant. The article does not provide any quantitative estimates of the benefits of hip resurfacing or compare it to other treatments for hip arthritis. It mentions that hip resurfacing may not be suitable for those with poor bone quality or kidney problems, but there are other concerns as well. Some studies suggest that the procedure impairs blood supply to the bone, increases fracture rates in the thigh bone, and generates an increase in metal ions. The article also mentions alignment changes that could put patients at greater risk of impingement and abnormal wear patterns. The uncertainty lies in how long the implants will hold up, as there is limited evidence for a device designed to substitute for total joint replacements with successful track records of up to 15 to 25 years. The article relies on the testimonials of orthopedic surgeons who view hip resurfacing favorably, but it does not provide information about their potential conflicts of interest. The article explains that total hip replacement is the major alternative to hip resurfacing but does not mention the potential disadvantages of resurfacing, such as its brief track record. It also does not provide information about nonsurgical alternatives for arthritic hips. The article mentions that the first hip resurfacing system was approved by the FDA and that competitors' systems are in trials. It notes that few orthopedic surgeons in the US are trained in this procedure. Overall, the article provides an overview of hip resurfacing and its potential benefits but lacks information on costs, quantitative estimates of benefits, potential disadvantages, conflicts of interest, and nonsurgical alternatives.
Claim: Hip resurfacing aimed at boomers
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The AP news story does a nice job of explaining what hip resurfacing is and how it fits into the history of hip replacement procedures. It summarizes the current availability of hip resurfacing in the US. However, the story provides virtually no evidence on the efficacy of resurfacing to support the mostly glowing testimonials of the three surgeons it quotes. According to the news article, the FDA “cited studies showing the Birmingham Hip resurfacer lasted at least five years…” What sorts of studies did the FDA analyze? What about the rest of the outcomes that patients value—such as improvements in pain and activity? Are there any randomized trials that compare similar patients who have undergone resurfacing with patients who have undergone total hip replacement? Is there follow-up beyond five years? These questions remain unanswered. The discussion of harms is likewise incomplete. The news article points out that hip resurfacing isn’t for everyone, and mentions two groups in whom it might not be appropriate. But the available research suggests the picture may be more complicated. There is disagreement about whether the procedure impairs the blood supply to bone or generates so much heat that it could cause the death of thigh bone. Bone death (necrosis of the femoral head) is a devastating complication for which there is currently no good solution. Other studies suggest additional potential problems. (For references and more details on potential harms, see “Harms of Treatment” above.) Although it is true that some researchers have found few problems with the devices and reported great success, readers deserve to know where the uncertainties lie. Perhaps the greatest uncertainty has to do with how long the implants will hold up. Though sufficient for FDA approval, survival of “at least five years” is not a strong endorsement. Total joint replacement, by comparison, has a track record extending 15 to 25 years. A closer look at the evidence might have reshaped the take-home message from this news report.",Hip resurfacing aimed at boomers,"This is a story about a procedure that is gaining in popularity in the US, but is still not widely available. The story does a good job of explaining the procedure and its potential benefits.

110,"### Context: According to an article from PolitiFact Oregon, there have been recent claims circulating on websites and blogs that Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio and Rep. Earl Blumenauer, both from Oregon, are socialists serving in the U.S. Congress. These claims are based on a post that has been replicated on multiple websites, stating that there are 70 card-carrying socialists in the House of Representatives. However, the number varies in different posts, with some claiming it's 73 or 76.

The article highlights that the claim is not accurate. The post that originated the claim is from a group called Sovereign Citizens United, and it mentions DeFazio and Blumenauer by name. It also includes a hammer and sickle emblem, suggesting they are socialists. However, the article points out that the list of supposed socialists is fraudulent and not supported by any evidence.

Frank Llewellyn, the former national director of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), states that there is not a single member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Senator Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member of the DSA was Rep. Ron Dellums, who left office in 1998.

Both DeFazio and Blumenauer deny being associated with the DSA and dismiss the claim as a made-up internet rumor. They emphasize their commitment to the Democratic Party and their independent thinking.

The article concludes that the claim of DeFazio and Blumenauer being socialists is false. The list of supposed socialists is taken from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes DeFazio and Blumenauer but is not officially socialist. The article highlights that voicing support for positions embraced by a group does not make a member of Congress a card-carrying socialist. The claim is deemed to be flagrantly false and based on misinformation and smear campaigns.

111,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca regarding a new law in Wisconsin that requires women seeking an abortion to get ultrasound scans. Barca stated that under the law, if a woman is raped and does not report it within the first 30 days, Republicans will force her to have an ultrasound. The article examines the accuracy of this claim.

The law, known as Act 37, was passed by majority Republicans in June 2013 and requires women seeking an abortion to undergo ultrasound scans. The person performing the ultrasound must describe what is being shown and provide the woman an opportunity to see the images, but she cannot be required to view them. The law also requires doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles.

Barca's claim specifically focuses on sexual assault victims and suggests that they would be required to have an ultrasound unless they report the assault to law enforcement within 30 days. However, the article states that there is no specific timetable in the law enforcement reporting provision of Act 37. Victims can report the crime and avoid an ultrasound scan without regard to any time limits.

While it is unknown exactly how many rape victims seek abortions but do not report being assaulted, national statistics show that a large percentage of rapes or sexual assaults against females are not reported to the police. In Wisconsin, evidence suggests that only 19 percent of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement.

In response to Barca's claim, State Senator Mary Lazich, the sponsor of the bill, stated that victims could avoid having an ultrasound by reporting the sexual assault.

In conclusion, the article rates Barca's claim as partially accurate but missing an important detail. While the law does require an ultrasound when sexual assault victims do not report the assault to law enforcement, there is no 30-day deadline for doing so.

The company aims to initially limit its scooter rentals to private land, which is exempt from traffic regulations, and plans to operate on 40 university campuses by the end of 2020. Bolt Mobility is also in talks with regulators to ease restrictions, arguing that its scooters can reduce traffic congestion and emissions. The company plans to expand to 20 cities globally by the end of this year and 50 across eight countries in 2020. E-scooter sharing has become popular for ""last-mile"" commutes in urban centers, but has also created problems such as abandoned vehicles and accidents. Paris has tightened rules on where scooters can be ridden following two deaths and numerous injuries. In Tokyo, e-scooters are treated as low-powered motorcycles under current laws, but there is growing momentum for making them more mainstream. The largest e-scooter company, Lime, has joined the Japanese lobby group Microbility Promotion Council. However, changing regulations may take time due to safety concerns.

The study found that the brain scans were able to accurately identify infants who had an older sibling with autism with 80% accuracy. However, the article points out that this detection does not provide any actual benefit for the children or parents, as the risk factor of having an older sibling with autism was already known. The article also highlights the omission of information regarding the costs of the test and the potential harms, such as parental anxiety and false positives. It mentions that the study is still in its early stages and not ready for use as a screening tool for babies. The article criticizes the lack of comparison to existing diagnostic approaches and the failure to explain why children younger than 2 cannot be accurately screened. It also suggests that the article could have provided more context by referencing other research on autism detection. Overall, the article acknowledges that the study is a novel contribution to the literature but raises concerns about its limitations and the lack of information provided.

114,"### Context: The article titled ""Mammograms Cut Risk of Breast Cancer Death by Half, Study Finds"" discusses a study that claims mammograms can reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. However, the author of the claim argues that the article fails to discuss the costs of mammography and presents confusing language that implies cause and effect. The author also points out that mammography is a screening method and does not prevent or cure breast cancer.

The claim suggests that the article should have cited conflicting evidence about the benefits of breast cancer screening. It mentions two large randomized clinical trials, the Malmo and Canadian trials, which found that women who chose mammography screening had the same breast cancer mortality rate as those who did not. The claim also criticizes the article for not explaining the concept of overtreatment or other potential harms associated with mammography.

The author argues that the article underplays the limitations of the original study. It highlights the absence of crucial details such as how women were invited into the study, how breast cancer deaths were determined, the type of cancer diagnosed, the presence of appropriate treatment, and the effects of lead-time bias. The claim suggests that the article should have emphasized that the study was a case-control study and explained the limitations inherent in such a design.

The claim suggests that the article should have provided statistical references to the number of women diagnosed and dying from breast cancer. It acknowledges that there is no direct evidence of disease-mongering in the article and finds it satisfactory that the source of the study is named and one independent source, Dr. Stephanie Burnik, is cited.

The claim argues that the article should have discussed alternatives to routine mammograms. It mentions the debate about the best schedule and age to begin mammograms but states that the clear alternative is not to be screened.

Finally, the claim states that the study was conducted in the Netherlands, which has a national screening program, and therefore, the information may not be applicable to other countries. It acknowledges that the article clearly states that it is based on a publication in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention from December 6, 2011.

116,"### Context: Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed Senate Bill 719 into law in August 2017, which allows for the temporary removal of gun rights through an ""extreme risk protection order."" The law took effect on August 23 and is modeled after similar measures in Washington and California. Under this law, a family or household member can petition the court for an extreme risk protection order if they can provide evidence that the individual in question has attempted suicide within the last 180 days or has been convicted of offenses such as domestic abuse, drunken driving, stalking, or animal abuse.

For a judge to issue an extreme risk protection order, they must find clear and convincing evidence, based on the petition and supporting documentation, that the respondent presents a risk of suicide or causing physical harm to another person in the near future. The court is not allowed to include any mental health diagnosis or connection between the risk and mental illness in their findings.

Once an order is issued and notice is served, the respondent has 30 days to appeal the decision. If an appeal is filed, a hearing must be scheduled within 21 days for the respondent to present their case. If there is no appeal or if the appeal is denied, law enforcement has the authority to search and seize weapons and ammunition.

Some gun rights groups have referred to this law as the ""Oregon gun confiscation bill,"" but there have been misrepresentations of its key parts. One report claimed that the law violated the 14th Amendment due process rights, but this claim is false. The law does not violate the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizens the right to a formal hearing before their property is seized.

Neumann raised over $643,840 during her campaign and is using some of that money to kick-start the organization. The focus of We Are Montana is to build a strong public health infrastructure in the state to prepare for potential surges in COVID-19 cases and help communities adapt to the new normal. Neumann believes that a strong public health infrastructure is necessary to handle a pandemic without having to shut down the economy. Rural and Native communities in Montana are at acute risk due to challenges such as limited access to healthcare, preexisting conditions, and lack of economic resources. We Are Montana will hold regular meetings on policy and strengthen connections across the state. The organization will also conduct a public health assessment in partnership with the Montana Public Health Association. We Are Montana is collaborating with organizations like Western Native Voice to address the immediate needs of tribal nationals in Montana through a COVID-19 relief fund. The relief fund aims to raise $50,000 to provide personal protective equipment, food, medication, and other supplies to tribal communities. The lack of hot water in homes on some tribal nations has been identified as a pressing need, as hand-washing is crucial during the pandemic. Additionally, medication delivery is a challenge due to restrictions on entering healthcare facilities and the need for self-isolation. Indian Country faces unique challenges from COVID-19, including overcrowded housing and multi-generational living arrangements. The pandemic has highlighted long-term problems faced by Native communities and the need to address the root causes of disparities in public health.

The ad, which contained racist and anti-Semitic messages, was randomly distributed to homes in Colonial Beach, VA. The newspaper reproduced the full, un-redacted version of the ad, leading to criticism from readers who felt that it was giving free advertising to the KKK. Local law enforcement also objected to the inclusion of the ad, as it contained contact information for joining the group. The editor of the newspaper explained that she wanted to show that racism exists in the community. The Westmoreland News did post a disclaimer stating that it does not condone or support the content or message of the flyer or the KKK.

The article also mentions that decisions on how to report the occurrence of KKK flyers in the media have not been consistent in the past. Some newspapers have redacted the group's contact information, while others have reproduced partial photographs of the flyers without contact info. The Huffington Post, for example, used a photograph of a KKK flyer found in British Columbia that included contact information. However, the Westmoreland News' front page image could be mistaken for a paid advertisement, which is why the claim that the newspaper ""ran an ad"" for the KKK is considered a mixture.

At Chelsea Piers Connecticut, a fitness class combines trampolining with rock climbing, providing a workout that engages both the upper and lower body. The class is described as being similar to working a leg press followed by using upper body equipment, but more entertaining. Trampolining is said to be equal in cardiovascular intensity to jumping rope and can enhance balance and spatial awareness. At JumpLife studio in New York City, trampolines are used in a dance-inspired cardio workout called JumpDance, which can burn up to 600 calories. Another class at JumpLife, called JumpGym, incorporates weights and push-ups into the trampoline workout and is popular among men. The founder of JumpLife hopes to attract seniors and children to the classes as well. Crunch fitness centers also offer rebounding classes that pair mini-trampolines with sculpt, Pilates, and interval classes. The bouncing motion of trampolining is described as being gentle on the body and rehabilitative. Trampolining is considered a joint-friendly way to add a cardiovascular component to a group fitness workout. It can vary in intensity from a brisk walk to a run. Trampolines have even been used by NASA to build bone density in astronauts. However, it is important to note that the surface of a trampoline is still unstable, so people with lower-extremity instability should be cautious. Some people also combine trampolining with other activities, such as watching TV. Overall, trampolines are being embraced as a fun and effective way to exercise in group fitness settings.

120,"### Context: The attorney for landowners challenging the recommended permit for the Davis Refinery has argued that the information provided by developer Meridian Energy Group has been vague and contradictory. The water permit is one of several obstacles that Meridian must overcome in order to build the refinery near a popular tourist attraction. The disagreement over the water permit is related to a dispute over the size of the refinery. Meridian initially applied for a permit to draw 645 acre-feet of water per year for a refinery that would process up to 55,000 barrels of oil per day. However, the company later reduced the planned oil capacity to 49,500 barrels, just below the threshold that requires a site permit from the state Public Service Commission. The state engineer's office has recommended issuing a water permit with a corresponding reduction to about 586 acre-feet annually. Landowner attorney JJ England argues that the change to the company's request is illegal and that the application should have been rejected. Other concerns raised by landowners include the potential impact on them, the amount of water wasted during treatment, and how wastewater from the refinery will be handled. Meridian has not applied for a wastewater discharge permit from the state Health Department. The hearing focused on whether Meridian will use all of the water for which it has applied for a ""beneficial"" use. The state engineer's office believes that the information provided by Meridian is enough to warrant a conditional water permit, which can be adjusted after refinery operations begin and the precise water needs are determined. Meridian has already started site work after receiving an air quality permit from the state Health Department. Environmental groups are fighting the permit in state court, with a hearing scheduled for December. The groups are concerned about pollution in the nearby national park, which attracts over 700,000 visitors annually. Meridian claims that the refinery will be the ""cleanest refinery on the planet.""

121,"### Context: The Department of Ecology in Washington state has rejected a water quality permit for the proposed Millennium Bulk Terminals facility near Longview. The department cited concerns about air quality, noise pollution, and potential harm to tribal resources as reasons for the rejection. Millennium Bulk Terminals had hoped to build a facility along the Columbia River to handle up to 44 million tons of coal per year, which would be transported by trains from Montana, Wyoming, and other states and loaded onto ships bound for Asia. The company plans to appeal the decision, claiming bias against the Longview community and a lack of consideration for employment opportunities. Environmentalists, tribes, and other groups have opposed the project due to concerns about global warming, coal dust pollution, and potential damage to fisheries. Supporters of the project argue that it would create jobs, generate tax revenue, and boost the local economy. The governor of Wyoming, a leading coal-producing state, expressed disappointment with the decision but stated that Wyoming would continue to work towards a plan for the safe transportation of coal through coastal ports. An environmental review conducted by Washington's ecology department and Cowlitz County found that 19 out of 23 environmental areas would face harmful effects from the project. The review also noted that coal dust pollution from trains would not be significant, but pollution from locomotives would increase the cancer risk for a low-income neighborhood. The project would result in more noise and traffic delays at rail crossings. Governor Jay Inslee supported the decision, stating that it was based on sound science and in accordance with the law.

122,"### Context: The article discusses the results of genetic and radiological testing performed on the mummies of King Tutankhamen and other members of his family. The tests were conducted between 2007 and 2009 by scientists from Egypt, Germany, and other countries. The results provide new insights into the life and death of King Tut.

The testing revealed that King Tut had contracted a severe form of malaria, which likely contributed to his death. This finding rules out the possibility of murder or another sickness as the cause of his death. The scientists also speculate that Tut was weakened by a broken leg, possibly from a fall. In addition to malaria and the broken leg, Tut had other health issues, including a cleft palate, mild clubfoot in his left foot, and other bone ailments. He and some family members also had a form of Kohler disease, which can cause foot bones to collapse but is not fatal.

The scientists believe that Tutankhamen had multiple disorders that may have weakened his immune system. They describe him as a young but frail king who needed canes to walk. In Tut's tomb, along with priceless gold artifacts, around 130 canes and staves were found, some of which showed signs of wear. This suggests that Tut relied on these walking aids.

The study also identified the mummies belonging to Tut's father, Akhenaten, and his grandmother, Tiye, based on shared blood groups. The scientists debunked speculation that Tut and his ancestors had severe abnormalities, ruling out conditions like Marfan syndrome and another condition that could have led to enlarged breasts. They explain that ancient Egyptian kings were typically represented in an idealized fashion, so it is unlikely that Tut or Akhenaten had significantly bizarre or feminine physiques.

Overall, the study provides important information about the 18th Dynasty, which lasted for 155 years and included Tutankhamen. It sheds light on Tut's health issues and the circumstances surrounding his death. The findings suggest that Tut's reign was cut short due to a combination of malaria and a weakened immune system caused by multiple disorders.

Jones was also the first black female resident at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston after receiving her medical degree from Arkansas in 1952. Born in Mayflower, Arkansas in 1927, Jones decided to pursue medicine after her older sister died from typhoid fever in the 1930s. She enrolled in Knoxville College at 16 and graduated in 1948. Jones chose UAMS because of its low tuition and proximity to her mother, not out of a desire to integrate a previously all-white institution. The school's board of trustees voted to increase the class size by one to ensure that no one could claim Jones had taken a spot from a white applicant. In 1950, she married Dr. James B. Jones, a psychology professor, and they had three children together. Jones established medical practices in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and Houston and completed her residency at Baylor, where she also taught. She was elected the first female president of the National Medical Association in 1985 and was a founding member of the Association of Black Cardiologists. Jones was also an activist and a member of the ""Freedom Four,"" encouraging people to join the civil rights movement. She and her husband often paid for students' tuition at Knoxville College. In the 1990s, Jones sponsored and co-founded a clinic in Haiti, bringing pharmaceutical samples and important drugs into the country past customs. Jones lost one of her eyes in 1988 due to glaucoma but continued working using a prosthetic until she began losing her eyesight in her remaining eye. She reluctantly retired in 2013.

The VA reached an agreement with the contract company to extend Williamson's care for another 60 days, and they will continue to work towards a long-term solution to keep him in his home. Disability Rights Oregon, an advocacy agency, filed the lawsuit on Williamson's behalf, claiming that the VA's actions violated its own regulations regarding offering a choice of providers and continuity of care. Williamson, who is on a ventilator and has a feeding tube, received 100 percent permanent and total service-connected disability benefits after being diagnosed with ALS. New Horizons, the contract company, has provided nurse-directed care for Williamson, but the cost is not specified in the lawsuit. The agreement between Disability Rights Oregon and the VA states that the VA will make efforts to explore other possible arrangements with in-home care providers to allow Williamson to remain in his home. This agreement is seen as a positive step, but the fight is not over, according to Emily Cooper, legal director of Disability Rights Oregon. Cooper believes that having the VA reach out to state-licensed home care providers will benefit not only Williamson but other veterans in Oregon as well. By filing the lawsuit, Disability Rights Oregon hopes to jump-start talks and ensure that the VA upholds its agreement.

125,"### Context: The article discusses a controversial surgical procedure called the ""liberation procedure"" that is being used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The procedure involves opening up blocked veins in the neck and chest to improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms of MS. The article mentions that some patients have traveled to Europe and spent their life savings on the procedure, indicating that it is unlikely to be covered by major insurers or Medicare. The costs of the procedure are said to run into the tens of thousands of dollars or more.

The article criticizes the choice of patient profiled in the opening paragraphs, as the patient did not experience any benefit from the procedure. The article suggests that stories should focus on patients who represent the complicated reality of healthcare instead of promoting best-case scenarios. It also argues that the article should have provided more information about the range of outcomes reported with the procedure and the need for better studies.

The article mentions that the procedure carries risks, including life-threatening blood clots, and quotes an expert who calls it ""unsafe."" However, it notes that there are no statistics on adverse effects available at this point in the development of the treatment.

The article criticizes the lack of discussion about the scientific evidence supporting the procedure and whether it actually improves symptoms in MS patients. It also points out that the patient profiled in the article had an aggressive case of MS, which may not be representative of all patients with the disease.

The article suggests that conflicts of interest should have been disclosed, as the researchers quoted in the article have reported relationships with companies that make drugs to treat MS. It also questions why there are not more doctors performing the procedure in North America and whether there are regulatory or financial issues preventing patients from accessing it.

Overall, the article argues that the story should have provided more information about the financial aspects, range of outcomes, scientific evidence, conflicts of interest, and availability of alternative treatments for MS.

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected. The problem is that in the desperate search for a cure, patients, family and providers can seek out risky and expensive treatments that haven’t been adequately studied.",Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment,"This is a story about a controversial surgical procedure for multiple sclerosis (MS) that is gaining in popularity despite a lack of scientific evidence that it works.

126,"### Context: San Francisco-based plant-based food company, JUST, is experiencing a surge in demand for its products, particularly its plant-based egg substitute called JUST Egg. The growing concern about the environmental impact of meat production and the desire for a healthier diet are driving consumers to seek alternative protein sources. JUST Egg, made from mung beans, is available in the United States, Canada, China, and Singapore, with sales evenly distributed between retailers like Walmart, Safeway, and Whole Foods, as well as restaurants such as Tim Hortons.

To achieve broader acceptance and compete with traditional eggs, JUST aims to reduce the cost of JUST Egg. Currently priced at 22 cents per serving, the company's goal is to lower the cost to 12 cents next year and eventually below five cents. The cheapest non-caged hen eggs in supermarkets cost around 16 cents each. JUST's CEO, Josh Tetrick, believes that achieving lower costs is crucial for the company's success.

After establishing a presence in Europe, Tetrick's next objective is to achieve profitability, potentially leading to a listing to raise funds. JUST has already raised approximately $250 million from investors worldwide, including Mitsui, Temasek, China Construction Bank, Founders Fund, the Benioff family, and the Heineken family. Tetrick plans to launch JUST Egg in European outlets in the coming months.

Investors are taking notice of the growth in plant-based foods, as demonstrated by the success of U.S. startup Beyond Meat, whose stock has nearly tripled since going public in May. Tetrick has hired food industry executive Dave Wagstaff, who has experience with global companies like McCain and free-range egg brand Happy Egg, to lead JUST's European team. The company's partners in Europe include Italian egg company Eurovo, German poultry group PHW, and online food delivery platform Delivery Hero.

Tetrick is confident that JUST can capture a portion of the $260 billion global egg market if executed correctly. The company expects low- to mid-double-digit million dollar revenues this year and anticipates multiplying sales by approximately seven next year. Operating profitability is their primary financial objective, which they aim to achieve within the next year.

128,"### Context: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, William Moerner, and Stefan Hell for their work in using fluorescence to enhance microscopes and allow for the study of molecular processes in real time. The three scientists were able to bypass the resolution limit of traditional microscopes by tagging objects with fluorescent markers and scanning them to create more detailed images. This technique, known as ""nanoscopy,"" is now widely used to visualize the internal machinery of cells and has important implications for understanding diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer. The previous resolution limit of microscopes meant that they could only see objects the size of the smallest bacteria, but not the individual components inside cells. Other techniques, such as electron microscopes, provide greater resolution but require preparatory measures that kill cells, making them unsuitable for observing living processes. The use of fluorescence allows for the observation of living things without destroying the sample. The Nobel laureates' work has revolutionized imaging and has opened up new possibilities for studying the workings of cells and molecular processes. Betzig works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the United States, Moerner is a professor at Stanford University, and Hell is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Germany. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is often overshadowed by the physics prize, but this year's award is well-deserved and has been praised for its significant contributions to the field of imaging.

129,"### Context: U.S. District Judge Michael Simon is expected to make a decision in a long-running case regarding the grazing permit of Hammond Ranches. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management granted a 10-year grazing permit to Dwight and Steven Hammond after they were pardoned by President Trump. However, a coalition of environmental groups sued to challenge the renewal of the permit. In July, Judge Simon limited the areas where the Hammonds could graze their cattle but allowed them to continue using other parts of the public allotments for their ranching operation. 

The Hammonds, a father and son who raise cattle in Oregon, were convicted of arson in 2012 for setting a fire on federal land that burned about 140 acres. Initially, they received minimal sentences and were released, but they were sent back to prison in 2016 after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that they must complete the mandatory minimum sentence of five years for arson. Their rearrest led to a 41-day armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon in 2016, led by two sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy. The standoff ended after authorities shot and killed the protestors' spokesman.

The Western Watersheds Project, the Center for Biological Diversity, and Wildearth Guardians filed a motion earlier this year to revoke the Hammonds' grazing permits, arguing that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke should not have granted the permits due to the Hammonds' past conviction. David Becker, an attorney for the environmental groups, argued that livestock grazing on public lands is a privilege, not a right, and can be revoked if abused.

During their 2012 arson trial, the Hammonds claimed they burned the federal lands to destroy invasive weeds, while prosecutors argued that they burned the land to cover up the illegal killing of a herd of deer.

The decision by Judge Simon will determine the fate of the Hammonds' grazing permit and will have implications for the ongoing legal battle between environmental groups and ranchers over the use of public lands.

131,"### Context: The article claims that a film producer has accused actor Kevin Spacey of drugging and raping musician Justin Bieber. The accusation was made by an anonymous ""production staffer"" who claimed that Spacey has a history of using his power and influence to prey on young, often underage boys in Hollywood. The article also mentions that Spacey has been accused by numerous people of sexual misconduct, some of whom were teenagers at the time of the incidents. Spacey is currently facing felony assault and battery charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.

However, the article points out that the source of this accusation is a junk news site formerly known as Your News Wire, now rebranded as News Punch. The site has a history of inventing sensational quotes and publishing false stories about celebrities and politicians. It often relies on anonymous sources and plays on conspiracy theories about elite pedophile rings. No other reports have suggested that Bieber is one of the people accusing Spacey of sexual assault, and it is unlikely that a serious criminal act would be exclusively reported to a junk news site.

The article also mentions that the News Punch article linked to another false story claiming that Bieber had stated that ""evil pedophiles run the music industry."" This further undermines the credibility of the accusation made against Spacey.

In summary, the article highlights the accusation made by a film producer against Kevin Spacey, alleging that he drugged and raped Justin Bieber. However, it emphasizes that the source of this accusation is a junk news site with a history of fabricating sources and publishing false stories. No other reports have supported this claim, and the article questions the credibility of the source and the website.

132,"### Context: Researchers at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia, according to a news release. The vaccine, called BD584, was able to reduce chlamydial shedding by 95% in mice. However, the news release lacks important information and context.

The release presents the study as if it were conducted in humans, but it fails to mention the potential costs and time required for testing and bringing the vaccine to market. It also does not provide any information about the number of mice studied, making it difficult to understand the significance of the 95% reduction in chlamydial shedding.

One major omission in the release is the lack of information about any harms or adverse effects observed in the mice. The study itself discusses the details of how the work was conducted in mice, but the release does not mention this and gives the impression that the study was conducted in humans.

The release also fails to mention that there is currently no other pharmacological treatment available for preventing chlamydia infection. It could have noted that public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Furthermore, the release does not mention that the vaccine is still far away from clinical application and may not even pass human trials. Instead, it focuses on how easy the vaccine would be to administer and how little training would be required. This overlooks the fact that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training.

While the release claims novelty in the study, given the absence of any available chlamydia vaccines, it is misleading about the study cohort and fails to mention the true nature of the study. It is unclear if the investigators had the opportunity to review the release before it was published.

In conclusion, the news release about the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia lacks important information and context. It presents the study as if it were conducted in humans, fails to mention potential costs and harms, and overlooks the fact that the vaccine is still far from clinical application.
Claim: Researchers produce first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"In many ways, this release provides much of the basic information reporters would need to determine how newsworthy the findings are. Where it was published. The specific antigen being studied and for which disease. A numerical breakdown of the benefits. But nowhere does it mention that this was a study conducted in mice and that, if past experiences with vaccines for other diseases hold true, a true vaccine for humans has a narrow chance of becoming a reality. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says the condition is easily treated, but if left untreated, can make it difficult for a woman to become pregnant A further complication of chlamydia is that it often carries no symptoms, so someone who is infected may not even know it. A safe and effective vaccine would certainly be of public health interest. But this research has to far to go before it will be available to the public — if ever.",Researchers produce first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia,"This news release from McMaster University in Canada describes a study of a new vaccine against chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease. The release does a good job of explaining how the vaccine works, but it is misleading in its description of the study cohort and in its headline, which claims the study shows the first “widely protective” vaccine against chlamydia. The release also fails to mention that the study was conducted in mice, and that the vaccine is still far from clinical application. The release would have been improved had it included information about the costs and time required for testing and bringing the vaccine to market, as well as any harms or adverse effects observed in the mice.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the receipt of over a million masks. New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs stated that the province would run out of testing kits in about a week if testing efforts were increased. Trudeau declined to provide specific projections but acknowledged a range of scenarios, from everyone getting better within a few weeks to the situation worsening.

135,"### Context: The article discusses a study on the diabetes drug Jardiance, which has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. The initial version of the article did not mention the cost of the drug, but an update noted that it costs over $4,000 annually. The article focuses on the relative risks of the drug's benefits and suggests that including a measure of absolute risk reduction would be more informative. It also criticizes the article for not mentioning any potential harms associated with Jardiance. The study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly, and the lead investigator and other co-authors disclosed financial relationships with the companies. The article mentions that Jardiance is an add-on therapy to standard treatment for diabetes, which includes statins and blood pressure drugs. It also notes that the drug was approved for use in the United States last fall. The article includes quotes from an interview with the lead investigator, indicating that it went beyond the study's news release.
Claim: Lilly diabetes drug slashes deaths 32 pct in heart-risk patients
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This Reuters story summarizes new findings about Jardiance (empaglifozin), a diabetes drug developed by Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim and approved by the FDA last year. Following a recently published study, Jardiance is now being positioned as an add-on to standard care and a preventative therapy that reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, as well as risk of death from any cause, in patients with type 2 diabetes. The story capably lays out the basics of the study, but its reliance on relative risk figures (which may tend to inflate the magnitude of the effect), as well as the lack of any comment on potential harms, were considered significant drawbacks by our reviewers. Editor’s note: We learned that Reuters made updates to the initial version of this story, including the headline, after our review was complete. Although we applaud such efforts to provide more information and context to readers, such efforts do miss readers like us who only saw the original version of the story. People with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without diabetes, according to the World Heart Association. Cardiovascular disease is also a leading cause of death among people with diabetes. An add-on therapy that can help prevent serious heart disease and fatal complications could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of people with type 2 diabetes.The CDC estimates that more than 9% of the U.S. population — or 29 million people — have type 2 diabetes.",Lilly diabetes drug slashes deaths 32 pct in heart-risk patients,"This story reports on a study that found the diabetes drug Jardiance (also known as empagliflozin) was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attack, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes. The story does a good job of quantifying the benefits of the drug, and of putting those benefits in context of the risks. However, the story should have mentioned that the study was funded by the drug’s manufacturer, Boehringer Ingelheim, and that the lead author and several co-authors have financial ties to the company. The story also should have mentioned that Jardiance is an SGLT2 inhibitor, a class of drug that has been the focus of much attention in recent years. The story would have been stronger had it included a note about the cost of Jardiance, and about the potential harms associated with the drug. The story also would have been stronger had it mentioned that the study was presented at the American College of Cardiology’s annual meeting, and that the findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

136,"### Context: The article discusses a study that found a correlation between excessive vitamin consumption and an increased risk of prostate cancer. The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, analyzed data from over 170,000 men and found that taking more than one multivitamin a day was associated with a 32% increased risk of advanced prostate cancer and a 50% increased risk of fatal prostate cancer.

The study also found that taking just one multivitamin a day did not cause harm and provided strong evidence that it was safe. However, the article notes that the study did not provide information on the frequency with which advanced or fatal prostate cancer normally occur, making it difficult to fully understand the significance of the increased risk percentages.

The article mentions that the study did not engage in disease mongering and only quoted the senior author of the paper. It suggests that it would have been helpful to have an independent source comment on the results presented.

The article does not provide information on other options for decreasing prostate cancer risk or other factors that increase prostate cancer risk. It also does not discuss the availability of multivitamins.

Overall, the article highlights the findings of the study regarding the increased risk of prostate cancer associated with excessive vitamin consumption. It emphasizes the importance of moderation in vitamin intake and suggests that taking just one multivitamin a day is safe. However, it acknowledges the need for further research and a better understanding of the absolute risk of advanced and fatal prostate cancer.

However the story fell short of the mark of informing readers because it failed to provide sufficient context to understand what the absolute increase in risk was. See our primer on absolute vs. relative risk. Instead of explaining that taking additional beta carotene and zinc supplements increased this risk even more, the story could have used that space to provide numbers to help men understand the frequency with which advanced prostate cancer occurs and how common it is that prostate cancer never advances or becomes fatal. Saying that risk was increased 32% or ""nearly doubled"" just isn’t helpful if readers aren’t given the baseline risk. 32% of what? Nearly double what?

137,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that Mike Pence, Indiana's governor and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate, supported ""gay conversion"" therapy, specifically the use of electric shocks. The claim dates back to 2000 when Pence was running for Congress and his campaign website stated that Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act only after an audit to ensure that federal dollars were not being given to organizations that encourage behaviors that facilitate the spread of HIV. Pence's position has been widely interpreted as supporting ""gay conversion"" therapy, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation.

The American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association have rejected the practice of ""gay conversion"" therapy. They state that there is no scientific evidence to support the claims of cure and that the potential risks, including depression, anxiety, and self-destructive behavior, outweigh any potential benefits. They recommend that therapists refrain from attempting to change individuals' sexual orientation.

""Conversion therapy"" has been banned by law in five states and Washington, D.C. The article reached out to Pence's office for comment on his stance regarding the issue but did not receive a response.

The article also mentions a similar accusation made against Republicans in July 2016 when their national platform included a statement supporting the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. When asked if this statement represented support for ""conversion therapy,"" Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus replied that it was not in the platform.

In summary, the article confirms the claim that Mike Pence supported ""gay conversion"" therapy, including the use of electroshock therapy. It highlights the rejection of this practice by professional associations and the banning of ""conversion therapy"" in several states.

The video of Ploumen posing with the medal was initially posted by BNR Newsradio in December 2017 but gained attention after a report by the Media Research Center in January 2018. The medal, known as the Commander in the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great, is often given to heads of state who meet with the Pope. Ploumen, who serves as the minister of foreign trade and development in the Netherlands, launched a pro-choice NGO called ""She Decides"" in response to President Trump's executive order that restricts U.S. aid to organizations discussing abortion as a family planning option. In an interview with the Catholic Herald, Ploumen stated that she assumed she received the medal during a Dutch state visit to the Vatican in June 2017. The Holy See Press Office confirmed that Ploumen received the honor as a ""diplomatic practice"" for heads of state, emphasizing that it was not an endorsement of her pro-abortion views.

139,"### Context: The claim that the Senate voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 12 January 2017 is accurate. The United States Senate voted 51 to 48 to approve a budget resolution that would pave the way for the repeal of the ACA. This resolution would allow Republicans' eventual repeal bill to move through the chamber with just 51 votes, preventing a filibuster by Senate Democrats. Every Senate Democrat present opposed the measure, while every Senate Republican except for Senator Rand Paul supported it. The House of Representatives later passed the same measure on 13 January 2017 with a vote of 227 to 198.

The viral Facebook message that circulated after the Senate vote claimed that the Senate voted to immediately repeal several individual provisions of the ACA. These provisions included ending coverage for preexisting conditions, veterans benefits, and aid to rural hospitals; removing discrimination protection for women in healthcare; cutting off funding for the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and directing committees to send budget legislation to defund and repeal the ACA. However, it is important to note that the Senate vote did not explicitly repeal the ACA itself. The vote was a step towards repealing the ACA, but no viable alternative plan had been proposed at the time.

The article also highlights the potential consequences of repealing the ACA. It mentions that the ACA provides protections for those with preexisting conditions, allows children to remain on their parents' insurance until the age of 26, and places limits on out-of-pocket costs. The article emphasizes that the ACA affects not only those who directly purchased insurance through the government marketplace but also those enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans.

It is worth noting that the article mentions President Trump's statement that he wants the replacement for the ACA to continue coverage for preexisting conditions. However, as of the time of the article, Republicans had not yet introduced an official replacement plan, making it difficult to determine how health insurance in the United States would change or if it would change at all.

In summary, the Senate did vote to repeal the ACA on 12 January 2017, and the House of Representatives later approved the same measure. The viral Facebook message accurately listed provisions that could potentially be repealed with the ACA, but it did not take into account the replacement legislation that would be written. The article highlights the potential consequences of repealing the ACA and the impact it would have on various aspects of healthcare coverage.

140,"### Context: Vice President Leni Robredo of the Philippines has criticized President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign, stating that despite the high number of deaths and the budget spent, the supply of methamphetamines, known as shabu, has barely been curbed. Robredo cited police data showing that annual seizures of the drug in the last three years were only around 1,000 kg, while estimated consumption is 3,000 kg per week, equivalent to 156 tonnes per year, worth about $25 billion. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine trade was worth as much as $61.4 billion in 2018. Robredo, who was appointed as the president's ""drugs tsar"" but was later fired after exposing flaws in the campaign, called for a change in strategy, focusing on pursuing the big suppliers rather than targeting ordinary people. In response, the presidential spokesman defended the campaign, stating that it had dismantled illegal drug factories, caused the surrender of thousands of drug addicts and pushers, and neutralized high-value drug suspects.

141,"### Context: The article confirms the claim that one in ten babies born in the United States is born in Texas. The claim was made by Joyce Mauk, president of the Texas Pediatric Society, who argued that access to healthcare for children is crucial because of the high number of births in Texas. The claim was supported by statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Texas Demographic Center.

According to the CDC, in 2015, there were 403,618 births in Texas, accounting for 10.1 percent of the 3,978,497 births nationally. The only state with a greater share of births was California, which accounted for 12.4 percent of U.S. births. The CDC also provided data for 2016, showing that there were 406,945 births in Texas that year, accounting for 10.3 percent of the 3,956,112 births nationally. These figures confirm that one in ten babies born in the United States is indeed born in Texas.

The Texas Demographic Center provided additional information, showing that Texas-born babies have comprised one in ten U.S. births since 2008. The share of Texas-born babies in U.S. births has been steadily increasing over the years, even following drops in the number of births during the Great Recession. This trend is expected to continue due to the younger age distribution of the state, its larger Hispanic population, and its significant population growth relative to other states.

In conclusion, the claim that one in ten babies born in the United States is born in Texas is accurate and supported by government data. The high number of births in Texas highlights the importance of ensuring access to healthcare for children in the state.

142,"### Context: The article in question is criticized for making grandiose claims without providing enough evidence or quoting doctors who support these claims. The article states that a new drug ""may conquer heart disease,"" but does not provide any quotes or evidence to support this statement. The article also fails to mention the cost of the drug or compare it to other cholesterol-targeting therapies. 

The article is also criticized for misrepresenting the number of deaths in the study. It states that there were ""16 deaths in the anacetrapib group, versus 21 in patients taking a placebo,"" when in fact there were 11 deaths in the anacetrapib group and 8 in the placebo group. The statistic referred to in the article is for a combined outcome that includes cardiovascular deaths, heart attacks, hospitalization for unstable angina, or stroke. 

The article is also accused of overestimating the effectiveness of statin drugs by using relative risk descriptions. It states that statin drugs lower risk by 25-30%, but the absolute reduction in heart attack risk is only about 1% for statin-treated patients. The article also fails to provide data on participants' cholesterol levels before and after treatment or what levels are considered healthy, only mentioning the percentage change, which is not very useful without additional context. 

The article is criticized for focusing excessively on the ""unprecedented"" changes in cholesterol achieved with the drug, which are surrogate markers that may not reflect any real benefit on patient outcomes. The article also fails to provide enough detail on the potential harms of the drug, such as the fact that treatment had to be discontinued in 17.6% of patients due to harmful cholesterol levels. 

The article is also criticized for not providing perspectives from experts without ties to the drug industry and for not mentioning the study's funding source (Merck, the drug's manufacturer) or the financial relationships of the investigators. The article also fails to mention other classes of drugs that raise HDL, such as niacin and fibrates. 

Overall, the article is criticized for its lack of evidence, misrepresentation of data, and failure to provide important context and information.
Claim: New drug ‘may turn back the clock on heart disease’
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This was an overly enthusiastic account of a study on an experimental new drug called anacetrapib that lowers bad cholesterol and raises good cholesterol. The study was designed to look primarily at the safety of the drug and not whether it prevented heart attacks. But that didn’t prevent the story from making some wildly positive statements about the likely benefits of treatment. The story stumbles out of the gate with an over-the-top prediction about how the drug “may conquer heart disease.”  It continues to lay on the hype with quotes about the “incredible” results and how the drug could be “the perfect new treatment for all people at risk of a heart attack.” We realize some of this enthusiasm came from the mouths of experts but we know there are many who would be far more cautious and we didn’t hear from them in the story. It closes with an erroneous description of how many people died in the study. Needless to say, not what we hope to see on the front page of the nation’s highest-circulating daily. By comparison, look at how NPR closed their online story: “Still there were four deaths from cardiovascular causes among the 800 patients taking Merck’s drug compared with just one among the same number in the the just-released trial results. So don’t count Merck’s drug approved just yet.” (Please note: we reviewed the first version of each story that we found – not any subsequent versions the news orgs may have published. In fact, the version we reviewed doesn’t even appear online anymore.) It would nice if preventing heart attacks was just a matter of lowering bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. However, research increasingly suggests that it isn’t as simple as that. Drugs that lower bad cholesterol through one mechanism do appear to be effective, but drugs that lower it another way may not offer the same protection. Similarly, people with naturally high good cholesterol seem to have a low risk of heart attacks, but not every drug that raises good cholesterol has cardiovacular benefits. (In fact, another experimental drug that raises good cholesterol was shown recently to increase the risk of heart attacks.) So far, the drug discussed in this story doesn’t appear to have the same problems as its good cholesterol-raising predecessor, but at this early stage of development we simply don’t know if it works. Larger studies might show that the drug has safety problems that haven’t shown up in this study. Or it might turn out that the drug is safe but doesn’t offer much protection. Some drugs even get approved only to later be recalled because of rare but serious adverse effects that aren’t apparent until millions of people start taking the medicine. This is all a way of saying that caution is required when a drug is this early in its development. There are any number of ways that it could get derailed prior to reaching the market, and so journalists have to take care not get too caught up in the excitement.",New drug ‘may turn back the clock on heart disease’,"This story about a new cholesterol-lowering drug, anacetrapib, is a prime example of the problems that can arise when reporters rely too heavily on a news release. The story is based on a talk given at the American College of Cardiology’s annual meeting, but it’s clear that the only source for the story was a news release. The story doesn’t provide any independent perspectives, and it doesn’t provide enough detail on the study’s design, the potential harms of the drug, or the cost of the drug. The story also misrepresents the number of deaths in the study, and it overstates the effectiveness of statin drugs. The story also fails to provide enough context on the drug’s potential availability. The story states that the drug “may be on the market in 2016,” but it doesn’t mention that the drug is still in the early stages of development and that it’s too early to predict when it may be approved. The story also doesn’t mention that the drug is still in the early stages of development and that it’s too early to predict when it may be approved."
143,"### Context: The article discusses a promising new HIV vaccine candidate called the mosaic vaccine. The APPROACH trial, which randomly assigned 393 volunteers from five countries to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo, found that the mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all recipients. However, the article criticizes the lack of discussion about the costs of the experimental vaccine, emphasizing that affordability is crucial for it to be effective in the world's poorest countries.

The article also questions the lack of quantitative data comparing the benefits of the mosaic vaccine to other vaccines or placebos. It mentions that the Ad26 vaccine was the ""best tolerated"" but does not provide information on potential adverse effects or indirect harms of the vaccine program. The researchers estimate that the vaccine will only work about 50 to 60 percent of the time, and there is concern that false reassurance from the vaccine could lead to a decrease in the use of other proven measures to control HIV, such as condoms.

The article acknowledges that the available research only focuses on safety and immune responses, not efficacy, and cautions against overinterpreting the results. It also mentions the lead investigator's financial involvement with Johnson & Johnson, the company funding the research, suggesting that the extent of his financial involvement should have been made clearer.

The article highlights the importance of other public health measures to control HIV, such as education, public awareness campaigns, and condom use. It emphasizes that the vaccine is still in development and not likely to be available soon. The novel aspect of the vaccine is its attempt to encompass the diversity of HIV strains found globally.

Overall, the article commends the lack of disease mongering and exaggeration in the reporting, as well as the use of caveats and outside sources to provide a balanced perspective. However, it criticizes the lack of discussion about costs and potential adverse effects of the vaccine.
Claim: There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story about an experimental HIV vaccine gets off on the wrong foot by describing the research as “promising,” which we’ve previously flagged as one of 7 words that shouldn’t be used in medical news. Why not? As our publisher, Gary Schwitzer, wrote: “The word promising means ‘likely to be successful’ or ‘to give a basis for expecting.’ There is far too much uncertainty in medicine for this word to be applied loosely in the coverage of medicine.” Despite this initial misstep, the story does quickly establish the preliminary nature of the research and cautions that it’s much too soon to know if the vaccine will ultimately be effective in preventing HIV infections. It also does a nice job of putting this research in context with other HIV prevention efforts that have succeeded in slowing the spread of the disease. More attention to the possible costs of a vaccine — a huge issue for the developing world countries most affected by the virus — would have rounded out this otherwise solid effort. This new vaccine approach, if proven ultimately to be effective, safe and affordable, could make a major difference in resource-poor settings around the world. But, as we’ve written about, the field of vaccine research related to HIV is littered with huge obstacles and there are never any guarantees that drug therapies will ever be accessible to the poorest parts of the world, where the need for a vaccine might be greatest. News stories on any vaccine under development should take care to point out these obstacles.",There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline,"This is a story about a new HIV vaccine candidate that is being tested in a clinical trial. The story does a good job of explaining the nature of the trial and the potential benefits of the vaccine.

144,"### Context: Britain is set to complete a plan next year to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. This commitment makes Britain the first G7 country to adopt such a target for 2050. The plan will outline the necessary actions for the government, businesses, and society to achieve significant emissions reductions across all forms of transport. It will also explore how technology can facilitate changes in transportation methods.

Transport Secretary Grant Schapps emphasized the importance of ensuring that transport is as environmentally friendly as possible, from driving cars to taking flights. This commitment comes in the midst of protests by climate change activists, including members of Extinction Rebellion, who have been targeting Britain's transport ministry. One of their concerns is the proposed HS2 rail project, which they oppose due to its impact on ancient woodlands. However, the transport ministry argues that the rail line will reduce journey times and be more carbon-efficient than driving.

In addition to the net zero emissions target, the government introduced an environment bill in parliament to establish legally binding targets for environmental protection and pollution reduction. The bill will also create an office for environment protection to hold the government accountable for progress towards the 2050 target.

Experts highlight that achieving the net zero target will require significant changes in the energy, transport, heating, and buildings sectors. To address this, Britain's business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, announced that the government will release an energy white paper in the first quarter of next year. This paper is expected to outline the government's ambitions for the country's energy system and provide clear targets and milestones for businesses to follow.

Overall, Britain's commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector by 2050 is a significant step towards addressing climate change. The government's plan, to be completed next year, will provide detailed actions for various stakeholders and explore the role of technology in facilitating sustainable transportation.

The article also mentions that individuals seeking Safe Place assistance generally wait behind the counter with an employee for help to arrive, and there are no hidden or secluded areas available at any QuikTrip locations. The program specifically targets homeless and at-risk youth, not individuals in immediate danger due to partner violence or human trafficking. The article warns that directing individuals who fear for their immediate safety to QuikTrip could place them at further risk and suggests that visiting a police station would be more appropriate in dangerous situations.

146,"### Context: The article discusses a study that found improved bone density in the spine and femur of participants who were moderately or fully compliant with assigned yoga exercises. However, the article raises questions about the specifics of the improvement, such as how much bone density improved and whether all participants saw improvement or just a few. The article also questions why only 227 out of 741 original enrollees were reported on and how many participants dropped out of the study. It mentions the potential dangers of yoga if not done correctly, such as joint strain and injury. The article acknowledges the lack of a control group in the study and the dependence on self-reporting of participants' daily yoga practice. It also mentions that bone density may not be the most important factor for hip fractures and questions the financial interests of the researcher. The article suggests that comparing yoga's effects against alternative weight-bearing exercises like running or walking could be valuable. It acknowledges that the overall benefits of yoga are well-established, but the research on its effects on bone density is relatively new and should be commended for attempting to answer specific questions.
Claim: 12 Minutes of Yoga for Better Bone Health
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This is a thorough and balanced report of research into the effects of yoga on bone density. While yoga provides a range of potential health benefits including increased flexibility, balance and strength (all factors which can help prevent falls and fractures), the researchers focused specifically on whether a 12 minute per day yoga routine could increase bone density. Although improvements were found after a decade of research, helpful caveats about the limitations of the study (lack of a control group, self-reported nature of the study) kept it away from the realm of exaggeration. Yoga is hugely popular and growing in importance, so understanding the specific effects of daily practice of yoga could influence current thinking about its role in disease prevention and health promotion. If a specific effect of yoga on bone density is likely then possibly reducing fracture risk through daily yoga practice could be a viable alternative to ingesting bisphosphonate drugs. As the article mentions, these drugs are widely prescribed for osteoporosis and are frequently toxic to the gastrointestinal system as well as having other numerous serious adverse effects.",12 Minutes of Yoga for Better Bone Health,"This is a story about a study that looked at the effects of yoga on bone density. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s design and limitations, and of putting the findings in context. The story could have been improved by including more specifics about the study’s findings, and by discussing the costs and potential harms of yoga. Osteoporosis is a condition that affects millions of Americans, especially women. Yoga is a popular activity, and one that is often recommended for its potential benefits. However, there is little research on the effects of yoga on bone density. This study, which is the first to look at the effects of a specific type of yoga (Iyengar) on bone density, is important because it provides some evidence that yoga may be beneficial."
147,"### Context: In response to the coronavirus outbreak, jails and prisons in the United States are taking measures to limit the spread of the virus and reduce inmate populations. In New York City, where there have been confirmed cases of the virus among inmates and staff, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the release of 23 inmates and the potential release of up to 200 more. The city is screening inmates to identify those at risk and is working to determine the eligibility and supervision of those who will be released. The New York City Board of Corrections has called for the release of around 2,000 inmates who are severely sick, held on low-level offenses, or jailed for parole violations. Other jails across the country, such as the Oklahoma County Jail in Oklahoma City, are also working to secure court orders for the release of inmates held on minor misdemeanors and considered minimal security risks. While many state prisons have implemented measures to limit the spread of the virus, they generally require a court order to release inmates. Federal prisons face similar restrictions, although President Donald Trump has expressed consideration for an executive order to release nonviolent prisoners. The challenge for both jails and prisons is how to safeguard a captive population that includes individuals with underlying medical problems. Inmates are more likely to have chronic medical conditions, making them more susceptible to severe illness if infected. This poses a risk to the public as the virus can spread from facilities to officers, staff, families, and the community. The United States has the highest incarcerated population in the world, with nearly 2.3 million people behind bars. County and municipal jails are seen as a pressing concern due to their more fluid populations, which increases the risk of transmitting the virus. Reducing jail populations not only limits the number of individuals at risk but also allows for better separation of remaining inmates to contain any outbreak. Some jurisdictions, such as the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office in Utah, have worked with local courts and prosecutors to release nonviolent prisoners with a promise to appear in court at a later date. The challenge for jails is to act quickly, as most have not planned for such a fast-moving medical crisis.

148,"### Context: The article addresses a Facebook post claiming that Kamala Harris is listed as ""Caucasian"" on her birth certificate. The post gained traction on social media platforms after Harris was named as Joe Biden's running mate. The article states that the authenticity of the image of the birth certificate is unknown, but regardless, the document does not list a race for Harris and does not describe her as Caucasian. It is common for birth certificates not to list a child's race, although the race of the child's parents has been used for statistical purposes. The birth certificate identifies Harris' mother as Shyamala Gopalan, who was born in India, and her father as Donald Harris, who was born in Jamaica. The article also mentions that a previous photo claiming to show Harris' parents was debunked. Overall, the claim that Kamala Harris is listed as Caucasian on her birth certificate is false.

149,"### Context: The article discusses Rep. Michele Bachmann's claim that the IRS is going to be in charge of a ""huge national database"" on health care that will include Americans' ""personal, intimate, most close-to-the-vest-secrets."" The article fact-checks this claim and provides information on the government's construction of a database, the role of the IRS, the type of information included, and the number of Americans affected.

First, the article clarifies that the government is not constructing a traditional database. Instead, they are creating a ""hub"" that allows real-time access to data from various databases at other agencies. The hub does not collect, centralize, or store data but is designed to verify transactions related to health insurance exchanges.

The article also states that the IRS is not ""in charge"" of the hub. It is being built by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, with the IRS having a supporting role in the effort. The IRS will not be able to view information in other agencies' databases through the hub.

Regarding the inclusion of ""personal"" or ""intimate"" details, the hub is not designed to access or store information about health conditions or other private details. It can access information like adjusted gross income and Social Security numbers, but these already exist in federal databases, so the hub does not represent an expansion of data collection.

Lastly, the article mentions that the hub will only affect a portion of Americans. Only individuals who log on to the new insurance exchanges to purchase insurance will have their data accessed by the hub. The estimated number of Americans who might interact with the hub is around 28.6 million, but this is a small fraction of the overall population. People with employer-provided insurance or government-provided insurance like Medicare or Medicaid will not need to interact with the hub.

In conclusion, the article states that Rep. Bachmann's claim is not accurate. The hub is not a ""database,"" the IRS is not in charge of it, it does not include ""intimate"" health data, and it only affects a small fraction of Americans.

151,"### Context: The article debunks several claims about tilapia being unsafe to eat. It states that the idea that tilapia are mutants and cannot be found in the wild is baseless, as tilapia are native to Africa and have been around since ancient Egyptian times. The rise of tilapia in popularity is attributed to its introduction into aquaculture in the 1980s. The claim that eating tilapia is worse than eating bacon or hamburger is traced back to a 2008 study that warns against consuming tilapia for controlling inflammatory diseases. However, experts argue that there is no truth to this claim and that tilapia still provides heart-healthy nutrients. The article also addresses the claim that tilapia contains cancer-causing dioxin. While dioxins are toxic substances linked to cancer, tilapia does not appear to have a higher risk of containing dioxins compared to other fish. In fact, because tilapia are often farmed rather than caught in the wild, their dioxin levels may be lower. Overall, the article concludes that the claims about tilapia being unsafe to eat are mostly fiction.

152,"### Context: The article discusses a claim that Huggies Snug and Dry brand diapers commonly cause severe diaper rash and chemical burns on infants. The claim is compared to a similar case in 2010 involving Pampers brand Dry Max diapers, where no link was found between the diapers and the reported cases of severe diaper rash and chemical burns. The article states that the materials used in Huggies diapers are the same as those used in other brands and have been thoroughly tested. The Kimberly-Clark corporation, the parent company of Huggies, expressed concern and initiated an internal review but found no product issues or abnormalities. They also stated that complaints of this nature are highly unusual, with a rate of about one for every 40 million diapers sold. The article explains that superabsorbent material (SAM) is used in virtually all disposable diapers on the market, including Huggies, and has been proven safe in over 450 consumer safety tests. The crystals in the diaper are a form of superabsorbent material that turns liquid into a gel to prevent leakage. The article argues that children can develop severe diaper rash and symptoms resembling chemical burns for various reasons unrelated to the brand of diaper they use. It suggests that assuming a rash or burn is directly related to the brand of diaper without reproducible evidence is a logical fallacy. Other factors, such as exposure to caustic substances or allergic reactions, may contribute to rashes or burns. The article also mentions confirmation bias, where people only pay attention to cases that fit the suspected pattern and ignore cases that don't. Overall, the article disputes the claim that Huggies Snug and Dry brand diapers commonly cause severe diaper rash and chemical burns, stating that such cases are coincidental or indirectly related to the brand of diaper used.

One woman died of cardiac arrest and the other was revived after her heart stopped. The story is quite clear on this:  there is no evidence. Excerpt: “To date, there hasn’t been a single human trial reported in a major medical journal,” he said. “This doesn’t mean that kombucha tea can’t possibly have health benefits, it just means that at this time, there’s no direct evidence that it provides the benefits it’s reported to have.” No disease mongering in the story.

154,"### Context: North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum stated that it will take a few more weeks to control the COVID-19 hotspot in Cass County, which includes Fargo. The county currently has the highest number of positive cases in the state, with 1,032 confirmed cases. Burgum has assigned a task force to implement new testing, tracing, and isolation strategies in the area. He emphasized the importance of execution and cooperation at the local level.

Burgum mentioned that 250 people were invited to participate in contact tracing in Fargo, but only 78 showed up. He highlighted the need for improvement in communication and personal responsibility to effectively combat the contagious disease. However, there was some positive news as the number of positive tests in the hotspot dropped for the second consecutive day. The Red River Valley COVID-19 Task Force has also started testing some individuals multiple times.

The article mentions that hospitalizations and deaths are crucial figures for tracking the spread of the virus. On Friday, the number of hospitalizations decreased by three, totaling 35. Additionally, two new deaths were reported, bringing the total to 42. Statewide, the number of active cases increased for the fourth consecutive day, reaching a total of 648, with 428 in Cass County.

Despite the ongoing situation in Fargo, Burgum described the Friday report as having ""all in all good numbers"" and providing hope. He also announced a virtual graduation ceremony for high school seniors on May 30, featuring North Dakota high school graduates such as Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, actor Josh Duhamel, and Nashville recording artists Tigerlily. Burgum clarified that the event is not meant to replace individual school ceremonies but is an additional celebration for students.

The article concludes by stating that for most people, COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms that resolve within two to three weeks. However, older adults and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are at a higher risk of developing severe illness, including pneumonia.

155,"### Context: The article criticizes a segment called ""The Cutting Edge: Robotic Surgery, Today!"" for not mentioning the cost of the equipment used in robotic surgery and how it adds to the price of medical treatment. The article argues that the omission of cost is a serious oversight. It mentions that the established daVinci models cost about $1.5 million, and the price of the new Si HD model has not been published yet but is expected to be higher. The article suggests that while surgeries done with daVincis may result in lower total costs due to fewer complications and shorter hospital stays, the story should have still mentioned the costs.

The article also criticizes the segment for not quantifying the benefits of the procedures discussed and not discussing the potential harms of robot-assisted surgery, such as misapplication and exposure to inexperienced users. It argues that the segment oversells the benefits of robot-assisted surgery and uses disease-mongering tactics to make the technology seem necessary.

The article points out that the segment does not provide evidence of the safety or effectiveness of the techniques and technologies profiled. It criticizes the use of an anecdote about a prostate cancer patient to generate emotions and make the technology seem necessary without providing evidence that the trans-navel surgery improves prognosis.

The article also criticizes the lack of balance or context in sourcing and the assertion of the inferiority of laparoscopic surgery not done through the navel or assisted by a robot. It mentions that navel surgery is presented as cutting-edge but does not specify where it is being done. The article also notes that the segment refers to the use of older daVinci machines, not the newer daVinci Si HD Surgical Systems featured in the segment.

The article mentions that voice-activated robot assistants are being developed at Georgia Tech and Emory University but are not yet on the market. It also notes that the new generation of daVinci surgery robots was introduced in April and that surgery through the navel is not widely practiced yet.

Overall, the article criticizes the segment for its omission of cost, lack of quantification of benefits, failure to discuss potential harms, overselling of benefits, lack of evidence of safety and effectiveness, and use of disease-mongering tactics. It questions the motivations behind ABC's decision to devote so much airtime to the segment.

In a perfect world the segment would be coherent and would feel apropos of something, but even that is not essential. Television is an ideal medium for this kind of demonstration. The problem is that when they put the segment together, the producers disposed of fundamental journalistic practices as efficiently as the daVinci Si HD bags up old organs to throw them away. Even if we accept that this piece is nothing more than a few minutes of techno-tainment, it still has inexcusable, almost inconceivable lapses in journalistic hygiene. It does not say how much these technologies and treatments cost It doesn’t say whether any independent research has been done to verify the claims of benefits It does not mention risks It fails to explore what treatment options patients have, beyond assuming they are inferior It doesn’t seek opinion from anyone who can provide insight about whether and how these things improve care, if at all  Yes, it is wonderful, even inspiring to see a doctor peel a grape and thread a needle with these tools. It’s great entertainment and eye-opening. [See the video in order to appreciate how fun and fascinating the demo is.

The article states that while it is true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the law received bipartisan support and was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. The law requires light bulbs to be 25% more efficient but does not specifically ban incandescent bulbs. The article also mentions that there is no evidence to support the claim that fluorescent bulbs are dangerous due to mercury release. The major light bulb manufacturers have developed halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis for the claim that incandescent bulbs have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs.

157,"### Context: In March 2017, anti-vaccination blogs spread misleading reports about the Swedish parliament, known as the Riksdagen, rejecting motions to establish a mandatory vaccination program. These blogs claimed that the Riksdagen rejected seven motions on May 10 that would have made forced vaccinations a law, citing violations of the Swedish Constitution and concerns about adverse reactions to vaccines. However, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Sweden clarified that only two motions proposing a mandatory vaccination program were rejected in 2017, and the rejection was not due to the belief that vaccinations are harmful. The spokesperson explained that all healthcare in Sweden, including vaccination programs, is voluntary.

The conspiracy theory blogs also falsely reported that the Riksdagen ""banned"" mandatory vaccinations. However, Sweden already has a voluntary vaccination program that has been in place for decades, covering ten diseases. The majority of children in Sweden are still vaccinated, with over 97 percent of two-year-olds receiving vaccinations against measles, mumps, and rubella. Despite this, Sweden experienced an increase in measles cases in 2017, with the number of reported cases exceeding the previous year during the first half of 2017.

The misleading reports from blogs like YourNewsWire.com were sourced from the National Health Federation, an ""alternative health"" group. However, this group has faced criticism and scrutiny, particularly from the American Cancer Society, which found no evidence that the NHF's recommended treatments for cancer provide any objective benefit. The American Cancer Society strongly advises against seeking treatment based on the NHF's recommendations.

In summary, the claim that the Swedish parliament rejected seven proposals in May 2017 to establish a mandatory vaccination program and enact a ban on the practice is misleading. Only two motions proposing a mandatory vaccination program were rejected, and the rejection was not due to concerns about the harmfulness of vaccines. Sweden already has a voluntary vaccination program, and the majority of children are still vaccinated. The misleading reports originated from an ""alternative health"" group that has faced criticism for its unproven methods of managing diseases.

158,"### Context: The article discusses the phenomenon of people flying with unusual animals under the claim that they are emotional support animals. It mentions specific incidents where passengers have flown with animals such as turkeys, pot-bellied pigs, miniature horses, and monkeys. These incidents have garnered attention and raised concerns about passengers abusing the system to avoid pet fees or travel with their pets.

The Air Carrier Access Act, passed in 1986, allows service animals to fly on planes and prohibits them from being removed simply because other passengers object. Service animals must be under the control of their owners and trained not to eliminate on airplanes. For longer flights, owners must provide plans for waste disposal. The emergency exit rows are not suitable for service animals, so they usually end up in the bulkhead rows or under the seat.

Emotional support animals, on the other hand, do not have specific training to assist with disabilities and are not considered service animals under the American Disabilities Act. They are meant to be part of an emotional therapeutic treatment plan and provide companionship and relief from loneliness, depression, anxiety, or phobias. There is no standardized certification for emotional support animals, but documentation from a mental health provider is required to fly with them.

However, obtaining certification for an emotional support animal is relatively easy. Some websites offer certification for a fee, providing owners with ID vests, certificates, and mental health letters. The ease of obtaining certification has led to concerns about people falsely claiming their pets as emotional support animals to avoid fees or restrictions.

The article concludes by highlighting the potential harm caused by faking a disability to fly with an emotional support animal. It can undermine the legitimacy of those who genuinely need emotional support animals and pose safety hazards if large or unruly animals panic or go on a rampage during a flight.

To avoid the Wild West atmosphere of on-line certification and unruly animals being brought aboard, it seems that a national and standardized system of certification would be beneficial for all involved.","People can fly with dogs, pot-bellied pigs, turkeys, monkeys, and miniature horses if they claim that their pets are emotional support animals.","What's true: The Air Carrier Access Act allows passengers to fly with service animals, and the American Disabilities Act allows passengers to fly with emotional support animals.

The study, presented at a scientific meeting, compared the use of aspirin to other types of pain relievers or no pain relievers at all.

According to the article, the study found that aspirin users were 29% less likely to develop pancreatic cancer compared to those who used other pain relievers or nothing at all. However, the article does not provide any information about the baseline rate of pancreatic cancer, making it difficult for readers to understand the scope of the potential benefits.

The article also fails to mention the side effects of aspirin or how often they may occur. It states that aspirin ""carries some side effects"" but does not provide any further details. The lack of information on side effects is concerning as it is important for readers to have a complete understanding of the potential risks and benefits of using aspirin.

Additionally, the article does not address the limitations of drawing conclusions from talks at scientific meetings, which have not undergone rigorous peer review. This is important information for readers to know as it can impact the reliability and validity of the study's findings.

The article does not provide any context or background information about pancreatic cancer, nor does it mention any other research into ways to prevent the disease. This lack of information makes it difficult for readers to fully understand the significance of the study's findings and whether it is the first and only research on this topic.

Overall, the article is based solely on a news release and does not include any quotes from independent sources. This lack of independent verification raises concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the information presented.

160,"### Context: The claim that drinking one diet drink a day triples a person's risk of dementia and strokes is based on a misinterpretation of a 2017 study published in the journal Stroke. The study found an association between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and an increased risk of stroke and dementia, but it did not establish causation. The study utilized data from the Framingham Heart Study, a well-known dataset, and found that adults who had one or more diet drinks a day were 2.9 times more likely to develop dementia and 3 times more at risk of strokes compared to those who virtually had none at all. However, the study was not designed to prove cause and effect and did not make any argument regarding it.

The study authors themselves cautioned that the study was observational and could not establish causation. They also pointed out the possibility of selection biases, where people with existing risk factors for cardiovascular issues may switch to artificially sweetened beverages for other health reasons. It is possible that the intake of artificially sweetened beverages starts after the cardiovascular risk is increased and is a marker of a high-risk profile rather than being a causal risk factor for stroke or dementia.

Other studies have also looked at the health effects of artificially sweetened beverages and reached differing conclusions. Some studies have found an association between the consumption of these beverages and an increased risk of stroke, while others have not. A 2012 study found an association between low-calorie soda intake and stroke risk but noted that there was no clear biological mechanism explaining the link.

The authors of the 2017 study in Stroke emphasized the need for clinical trials to establish causation and investigate possible mechanisms linking artificially sweetened beverages to stroke or dementia. They suggested that future trials should also examine whether these beverages are associated with important stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure.

In summary, the claim that drinking one diet drink a day triples a person's risk of dementia and strokes is based on a misinterpretation of a study. While the study found an association between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and an increased risk of stroke and dementia, it did not establish causation. Further research, including clinical trials, is needed to investigate the potential health effects of these beverages.

161,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by actress Mia Farrow that there have been only 143 cases of absentee-ballot fraud in the United States over the last 20 years. The claim is largely accurate, as it is based on a database compiled by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The database includes various types of election fraud and lists a total of 1,290 proven instances of voter fraud over more than 30 years. Farrow's claim specifically focuses on instances of fraudulent use of absentee ballots.

The article notes that the Heritage Foundation's database does not differentiate between mail-in votes and absentee votes, as there is no practical difference between the two terms. It also highlights that the database includes fraudulent attempts that would have benefited candidates from any party, debunking the notion that voter fraud is a partisan issue.

However, the article points out that there is a discrepancy in the number of listings under the category of fraudulent use of absentee ballots. Farrow's claim of 143 cases is accurate based on the database at the time of her tweet, but the Heritage Foundation currently lists 145 criminal convictions for absentee-ballot fraud dating back 32 years.

The article also discusses the limitations of the Heritage Foundation's database. It is not exhaustive and does not capture all cases or reported instances that are not investigated or prosecuted. Additionally, the majority of examples in the database are related to local and state elections rather than presidential elections.

The article provides examples from the database related to presidential elections, which vary in severity. These examples include individuals voting for both Democratic and Republican candidates and involve single extra ballots or more serious instances of fraudulent signatures.

In conclusion, the article states that it is practically impossible to calculate the percentage of votes represented by fraudulent ballots based on the Heritage Foundation's database. However, it emphasizes that regardless of how it is counted, the .0006% figure cited by Farrow overstates the commonality of voter fraud. The correct figure, as stated by Ellen Weintraub, the commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, is .00006%.

162,"### Context: The claim that smoking in cars with children is illegal starting January 30, 2018, is false. While there are several state and local governments that have enacted such bans, there is no federal prohibition on smoking in cars with children present. The article that made this claim is based on a small kernel of truth, referring to a bill passed by Alabama's House of Representatives on January 30 that would ban smoking in cars with individuals under the age of 19 present. However, this bill still needs to be approved by the state Senate and signed by the governor before it can become law. Even then, the law would not take effect until the ""first day of the third month"" following the governor's approval. 

It is important to note that there are already eight states, as well as Puerto Rico and Guam, that have laws banning smoking in cars with children prior to 2018. Additionally, a number of cities and towns have passed their own ordinances on this matter. England also banned smoking in cars with children in October 2015, with a fine of £50. 

In conclusion, the claim that a law went into effect on January 30, 2018, banning smoking in cars with children is false. While there are existing laws in some states and countries, there is no federal prohibition on this issue. The article that made this claim was based on a bill passed by Alabama's House of Representatives, but it has not yet become law.

163,"### Context: Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology, George Smith from the University of Missouri, and Gregory Winter of Britain’s MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their pioneering work in enzymes and antibodies. Arnold, the fifth woman to win a chemistry Nobel, was awarded half of the prize, while Smith and Winter shared the other half. Arnold's research on enzymes has laid the foundation for the development of better industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Smith developed a method using a virus that infects bacteria to produce new proteins, while Winter used the same technique to engineer the evolution of antibodies for more effective medicines. The antibody injection Humira, developed by AbbVie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, is the world's top-selling prescription medicine and is based on Winter's work. Other antibody drugs, including those used in cancer treatments, also use the same technology. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was created and funded by Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and has been awarded since 1901. This year, the Nobel Prize in Literature was not awarded due to a rift within the Swedish Academy over a rape scandal. The science and peace prizes are selected by other bodies.

164,"### Context: The number of births in the United States has reached its lowest level since 1987, according to a provisional report based on a review of birth certificates. The report counted 3.853 million births in 2017, which is about 92,000 less than the previous year. This decline is surprising given that the economy was growing and unemployment was low. Experts believe that shifting attitudes about motherhood among millennials and changing immigration patterns may be contributing to the decline. Millennials may be more inclined to delay having children or have fewer children. Changes in the immigrant population, particularly the increasing proportion of Asians who typically have fewer children, may also be a factor. The use of long-acting forms of contraception, such as IUDs, has been increasing as well. 

The report also found that the general fertility rate, which measures the rate of births to women ages 15 to 44, reached a record low of about 60 per 1,000. However, birth rates for women in their early 40s increased by 2 percent from the previous year. Cesarean section rates, which had been decreasing for four years, rose slightly, possibly due to the higher number of first-time births involving older mothers. Rates of preterm and low birth weight babies also increased for the third consecutive year. 

Teen birth rates continued to decline, dropping by 7 percent in 2017. Birth rates for women in their 20s fell by 4 percent and reached record lows. The most surprising finding was a slight decline in birth rates for women in their 30s, which had been steadily rising and had recently become the age group with the highest number of births. However, experts are unsure if this decline is a fundamental change or just a temporary blip. 

Another significant finding is that the current generation is moving further away from having enough children to replace itself. The fertility rate in the U.S. has fallen below the standard benchmark for replacement, which is 2.1 children per woman. In 2017, the rate fell below 1.8, the lowest level since 1978. This decline is closing the gap between the U.S. and countries like Spain, Greece, Japan, and Italy, which have even lower fertility rates.

165,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that the $738 billion expenditure for defense, including the creation of a Space Force, could be used to fund Medicare for All. The claim is based on a tweet that suggests diverting funds from initiatives like the Space Force to universal healthcare. However, the article points out that budgetary appropriations are largely a matter of partisan opinion.

The article provides context by mentioning that the $738 billion defense budget is only a portion of the federal budget for fiscal year 2020, which totaled a record $4.746 trillion. Sixty percent of this budget went to spending on mandated benefits such as Medicare and Medicaid.

The article also highlights the variability in estimating the cost of Medicare for All. Estimates range from $14 trillion to $38 trillion over a decade, or $1.4 trillion to $3.8 trillion per year. The current spending on Medicare and Medicaid alone is projected to be $1.097 trillion in fiscal year 2020.

The article mentions that the United States spends significantly more of its GDP on healthcare compared to other countries. In 2016, the U.S. spent 17% of its GDP on healthcare, while other countries spent less than 13% of their GDP.

The article concludes that without a consensus on the cost of Medicare for All, any comparison to the defense budget is largely speculative. However, it notes that total healthcare spending in 2018 was about $3.6 trillion, which is lower than most estimated annual costs of Medicare for All.

In summary, the article discusses the claim that the defense budget could fund Medicare for All. It provides context on the federal budget and healthcare spending, and highlights the variability in estimating the cost of Medicare for All. The article concludes that the claim is largely speculative due to the lack of consensus on the cost of the healthcare program.

166,"### Context: A recent article titled ""Stem cells reverse blindness caused by burns"" reports on a new experimental technique that uses stem cells to treat blindness caused by chemical burns to the cornea. The article highlights that the treatment was considered successful for 82 out of 107 eyes treated. However, it fails to provide a comparison between this technique and standard treatments.

The article includes enthusiastic statements, such as calling the results a ""stunning success"" and quoting an independent researcher who refers to the treatment as a ""roaring success."" It does not mention the potential risks of infection from the procedure or the possibility of damage to the healthy eye used as a source of stem cells.

The trial involved a small number of patients, but the article does not mention that there was no control group. This means that the patients who underwent the experimental procedure were not directly compared to similar patients who received no treatment or an alternative therapy. The article also fails to explain that this type of trial, where researchers were aware of which eyes had been treated, is more susceptible to biased interpretation of the results.

The article does acknowledge that the treatment is only applicable to people with chemical burns to the surface of their eyes and who have enough healthy tissue to provide a source of stem cells. However, it does not mention that some of the study authors have affiliations with companies involved in developing and marketing stem cell treatments, which could be seen as a potential conflict of interest.

The article briefly mentions alternative treatments such as artificial corneas and cornea transplants from cadavers but presents them as having inherent disadvantages without comparing them directly to the new technique. It also fails to provide information on the success rate of alternative treatments for similar burns.

While the article acknowledges that the technique is experimental and does not provide predictions on when it might be widely available, it does state that the stem cell transplants ""offer hope to the thousands of people worldwide every year who suffer chemical burns on their corneas,"" potentially misleading readers into thinking the treatment will be available soon.

Overall, the article accurately reports on the success of the experimental technique but fails to provide important comparisons, disclose potential risks and conflicts of interest, and adequately discuss the limitations of the findings.

167,"### Context: The article discusses how Rush Limbaugh, a popular talk radio host and conservative political commentator, was disqualified from the Vietnam-era draft due to a pilonidal cyst. The author mentions that Limbaugh's draft status became a subject of interest because he was a vocal critic of Bill Clinton's efforts to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. The author also highlights that other prominent right-wing Republicans, such as Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, also avoided military service during that time.

The article provides information about Limbaugh's draft classification. It states that Limbaugh initially held a 2-S (college deferment) classification while he was a student at Southeast Missouri State University. However, after dropping out of college, he no longer qualified for the deferment and was subject to being reclassified as 1-A (available immediately for military service) and drafted. Limbaugh was eventually reclassified as 1-Y (qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency), which effectively ended his draft eligibility.

The author explains that Limbaugh's 1-Y classification was likely due to a physical problem, specifically a pilonidal cyst. Limbaugh himself stated that he had an ""inoperable pilonidal cyst"" and a ""football knee from high school."" The article mentions that a pilonidal cyst is a congenital condition that can cause discomfort and discharge, and it is considered a disqualifying condition for military service.

Critics of Limbaugh have argued that his pilonidal cyst was a minor condition that could have been easily corrected through surgery and that he used it as an excuse to avoid military service. However, the article notes that a pilonidal cyst is viewed by the military as a needless risk in unsanitary conditions, and it can be legitimately disqualifying for induction.

The article also mentions that Limbaugh has dismissed the issue of his draft status as ""Internet BS"" and has provided non-responsive answers when questioned about it. The author suggests that Limbaugh's evasive responses and dismissal of the issue may indicate that he is avoiding the question.

In summary, the article confirms that Rush Limbaugh was disqualified from the Vietnam-era draft due to a pilonidal cyst. It discusses the controversy surrounding his draft status and highlights the criticism he has faced for avoiding military service while being a vocal supporter of military solutions in politics.

### Explanation:
",unproven,"There is, of course, a huge difference between draft evasion (or “draft dodging”) and draft avoidance: The former involves the use of unethical or illegal means (e.g., bribing a doctor to falsify a medical report, fleeing the country) to escape military service; the latter involves taking advantage of established legal means (e.g., college deferments, conscientious objector status) to avoid or delay military service. The issue discussed here is clearly not one of draft evasion, and the matter of who is justified in criticizing whom for not serving in Vietnam is a gray area to be hashed out in the public arena. The only conclusions drawn here are that Rush Limbaugh was ineligible for the draft due to a physical condition, that he had a pilonidal cyst, and that if there’s an explanation for his draft status other than the cyst, he has yet to offer it.",Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh was disqualified from the Vietnam-era draft due to a pilonidal cyst. ,Rush Limbaugh was disqualified from the Vietnam-era draft due to a pilonidal cyst.
168,"### Context: A new study suggests that women with early-stage breast cancer may not need to undergo extensive lymph node surgery. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that removing only the sentinel lymph nodes, the first nodes to which cancer is likely to spread, was just as effective as removing additional lymph nodes in terms of overall survival rates.

The study involved over 8,000 women with early-stage breast cancer who were randomly assigned to either undergo sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. The researchers found that after five years, the overall survival rate was 92.5% for women who had sentinel node biopsy and 91.8% for those who had axillary lymph node dissection. The difference was not statistically significant, indicating that both approaches were equally effective.

The study also found that women who had sentinel node biopsy had fewer complications compared to those who had axillary lymph node dissection. Complications such as lymphedema, a painful swelling of the arm, were more common in the axillary lymph node dissection group.

The researchers noted that their findings challenge the current standard of care, which typically involves removing additional lymph nodes. They suggested that the less invasive approach of removing only the sentinel nodes could spare women unnecessary surgery and potential complications.

However, the study also acknowledged that there is a lack of long-term evidence on the potential harms of both approaches. It did not provide specific numbers on how often complications occur or compare the potential harms of the two procedures.

The article did not discuss the financial cost of the two approaches or whether insurers are likely to curtail coverage based on the new findings. It also did not address the fact that recruitment for the study was stopped early due to the high overall survival rate, which would have taken 20 years to reach the required number of deaths for a fully powered analysis.

Overall, the study provides evidence that removing only the sentinel lymph nodes may be a viable alternative to more extensive lymph node surgery for women with early-stage breast cancer. However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of both approaches.

170,"### Context: The claim that Tariq Ramadan, a prominent Islamic studies scholar, said ""we are here to colonize the U.S. and Canada"" with Sharia law is false. There is no evidence that Ramadan ever made this statement. In 2004, the George W. Bush administration barred Ramadan from entering the U.S. over allegations of donating to a charity linked to Hamas, but the restriction was lifted in 2010. In February 2018, Ramadan was arrested in France on rape charges. It is unclear whether these charges prompted the fake quote's resurgence on social media.

The quote in question appears to have originated on the anti-Muslim site BareNakedIslam.com in a 2015 post. It was accompanied by a video commentary by Marc Lebuis, the founder of a French-Canadian website that aims to expose Islamist activities. Lebuis referred to a 2004 interview with Ramadan in Egypt Today, where Ramadan discussed Sharia law. However, Ramadan never mentioned colonizing the U.S. and Canada or using violent jihad to do so. Instead, he advocated for Canadian Muslims to use the existing court system rather than separate Sharia courts.

The fake quote and stories about the allegations against Ramadan spread on far-right websites, raising questions about the intersection of misogyny and racism when it comes to Muslim women. Muslim women have been speaking out about assault and abuse within the religious community using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo. Mona Eltahawy, an author and activist, highlighted the difficulty Muslim women face when coming forward with accusations of sexual assault due to Islamophobic portrayals of Muslim men as predators.

Ayesha Chaudhry, an associate professor of Islamic studies and gender studies, discussed the double bind Muslim women face in addressing systemic inequality while dealing with assault. Chaudhry also mentioned the portrayal of a dangerous Muslim man, an imperiled woman, and a civilizing European in stories about crimes committed by Muslim men in the Western media. The Tariq Ramadan case exemplifies this motif, and during the trial, various forms of societal oppression will likely be brought to light.

In summary, the claim that Tariq Ramadan said ""we are here to colonize the U.S. and Canada"" with Sharia law is false. The quote originated on an anti-Muslim website and was a misinterpretation of Ramadan's comments on Sharia law in Canada. The case highlights the challenges faced by Muslim women when addressing assault and the portrayal of Muslim men in the media.

171,"### Context: The article discusses the concerns raised by safety experts and activists regarding the safety of old equipment in the oil refinery industry. The devastating fire at the Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) refinery in June has raised worries about potential future disasters in an industry that heavily relies on outdated infrastructure. The PES refinery is one of nearly 30 in the United States that are over a century old, and a review of over 100 operating U.S. refineries showed that, on average, they are 80 years old.

While refineries do update their systems and replace old parts, incidents like the PES fire, as well as previous incidents in Washington state and California, have been linked to equipment installed in the 1970s that had been allowed to run to failure. Some older equipment is exempt from more stringent standards for newly installed parts, which raises concerns about future incidents. Regulators offer exemptions for older components and do not require all pieces of plant machinery to be checked.

The article highlights the PES fire, which was caused by corroded piping that had not been checked since it was installed in 1973. The fire resulted in a fuel leak, explosions, and the release of toxic hydrofluoric acid into the air. Similar incidents in the past, such as the Tesoro refinery explosion in Washington in 2010 and the Chevron refinery blast in California in 2012, were also caused by failing, decades-old equipment that did not meet industry standards but were not in violation of regulations.

The article mentions that regulators overseeing U.S. oil refinery safety, such as the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), allow some refinery components to continue being used even if they do not meet newer standards. The American Petroleum Institute (API), an oil industry group, has recommended codes that act as the industry's standards, but these codes do not require every piping component to be inspected.

The article also highlights concerns about maintenance at the PES refinery, which was already struggling financially. Workers had raised concerns about the refinery's maintenance, and a planned large-scale maintenance project was significantly scaled back. The OSHA and EPA require refineries to maintain and inspect equipment, but the details of how and when to inspect are filled in by industry standards that may not have the same enforcement as law.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for stricter regulations and enforcement to ensure the safety of aging equipment in the oil refinery industry.

172,"### Context: Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can be toxic to dogs and other pets. These bacteria are a diverse group of bacterial species that are found in nature. When significant amounts of nutrients, such as fertilizer, enter waterways, it can lead to massive blooms of cyanobacteria. While not all species of cyanobacteria produce toxins, some can produce potent toxins called cyanotoxins, which can cause severe or fatal illness in animals and humans.

According to a review paper published in the scientific journal Toxins, cyanobacterial poisoning of animals is common and occurs seasonally. It happens every year in the US and around the world. Animals are particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of cyanotoxins, and often, the neurotoxins can kill them before they can receive veterinary care. The conditions for cyanobacteria growth are most favorable during certain times of the year when people are out and about with their animals.

The claim that blue-green algae can poison dogs and other pets is supported by the information in the article. Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are capable of producing toxins that can cause severe or fatal illness in animals. This poisoning is common and occurs seasonally, with the most cases happening during certain times of the year when conditions are favorable for cyanobacteria growth.

It is important for pet owners to be aware of the potential dangers of blue-green algae and take precautions to prevent their pets from coming into contact with contaminated water. This includes avoiding bodies of water with visible algae blooms and not allowing pets to drink or swim in water that may be contaminated. If a pet shows symptoms of cyanobacterial poisoning, such as vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, or seizures, immediate veterinary care should be sought.

In conclusion, blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, can be toxic to dogs and other pets. Cyanobacterial poisoning is common and occurs seasonally, with the most cases happening during certain times of the year. Pet owners should be aware of the risks and take precautions to keep their pets safe.

173,"### Context: France is experiencing an acceleration in its coronavirus death rate, with the total number of cases nearing 100,000. The country is likely to become the fifth country, after Italy, Spain, the United States, and Germany, to cross the 100,000 threshold. The Health Minister, Olivier Veran, stated that the pandemic is still expanding and the figures prove it. The government has decided to mass screen nursing homes, which account for about 27% of the total death toll. Veran emphasized the importance of citizens staying at home and continuing their efforts.

Some health officials had suggested that French people were not complying as strictly with the national lockdown compared to other countries. France started including data from nursing homes last Thursday, which explains why the official number of deaths has more than doubled since Wednesday. In the last 24 hours, 605 people died from COVID-19 in hospitals, marking a new daily record and bringing the total hospital fatalities to 6,494. The death rate in hospitals increased by 10%, up from 6% on Sunday and 9% on Saturday. Deaths in nursing homes also rose by 10% to 2,417, resulting in a total of 8,911 deaths.

Additionally, there are currently 7,072 serious coronavirus cases being treated in intensive care units, representing a small increase of 1.3% from Sunday. This provides some relief to the French health system, which is under strain.

In summary, France is seeing a rapid increase in its coronavirus death rate, with the total number of cases nearing 100,000. The government has decided to mass screen nursing homes, which account for a significant portion of the death toll. Health Minister Olivier Veran emphasized the importance of citizens staying at home. The death rate in hospitals and nursing homes has increased by 10%, and there are currently 7,072 serious cases being treated in intensive care units.

174,"### Context: The claim in the article is that after prohibition ended, police deaths did not reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs. However, the article states that this claim is not entirely accurate and is misleading. While it is true that 1930 was the deadliest year for police in U.S. history, with 307 officers dying, the claim that police deaths did not reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs is incorrect. In 1970, the year before Nixon declared war on drugs, police deaths actually exceeded 200. Additionally, not all police deaths are violent, as many officers die from car crashes, illnesses, and other causes. The data cited in the viral post includes all deaths of police officers each year, both violent and non-violent, on-duty and off-duty. In 2007, for example, 202 officers died, but only 57 of those deaths were caused by criminals while on duty. The article also points out that the number of police deaths has been on the decline for decades, even as the drug war continues and the number of officers has increased. The comparison between the deadly years of Prohibition and the war on drugs is misleading because it does not take into account the different causes of police deaths and the overall decline in police deaths over time. Therefore, the claim that police deaths did not reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs is not supported by the data and is misleading.
Claim: After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"A viral image making the rounds on 4/20 compared the number of police officer deaths during Prohibition to the drug war: ""After prohibition ended, police deaths didn't reach 200 a year again until the year Nixon declared war on drugs,"" the image said. Those numbers aren’t totally accurate, and the comparison itself is misleading. For one, it counts many officers' deaths that had nothing to do with the prohibition of drugs or alcohol, like an officer who dies of cancer or in a car crash on vacation. And despite the direct comparison between the deadly years of Prohibition and the war on drugs, police deaths have largely been on the decline for decades even as the drug war continues and the number of officers has grown significantly. Since the image uses a semi-accurate statistic to make a misleading comparison.

175,"### Context: The article discusses President Trump's advocacy for hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Trump has claimed that the drug can help people with the coronavirus and that it will not hurt them. However, the article states that these claims are unverified and that the drug has not been approved as a treatment for COVID-19. Trump's own health experts have stated that more studies are needed to determine the drug's safety and effectiveness.

The article also addresses Trump's misrepresentation of the facts regarding his firing of the intelligence community's inspector general. Trump claimed that the whistleblower complaint that led to his impeachment was ""fake"" and ""totally wrong,"" but the article states that key details of the complaint have been corroborated and that witnesses have confirmed its accuracy.

In addition, the article fact-checks Trump's statements about the Spanish flu, impeachment, social distancing guidelines, the state of the economy, his knowledge of the coronavirus outbreak, his social media following, travel restrictions, and the mortality rate of COVID-19. The article concludes that many of Trump's claims are unsupported and misleading.

Overall, the article highlights the disconnect between Trump's statements and the information provided by public health authorities and experts. It emphasizes the need for more research and caution when it comes to potential treatments for COVID-19.

176,"### Context: Deborah Harry, the lead singer of Blondie, claimed that she had a close encounter with serial killer Ted Bundy in New York in the early 1970s. She stated that she was trying to hail a cab when a man in a white car offered her a ride. She got into the car, but became nervous when she realized there were no door handles or window cranks. She managed to open the door from the outside and escaped. Harry later read about Bundy's execution and realized that he matched the description of the man who tried to abduct her. However, there are inconsistencies in Harry's account. The chronology does not match up with Bundy's known movements, as he was not in New York during the early 1970s. Additionally, Bundy did not drive a stripped-out car like the one described by Harry. It is also common for women to mistakenly believe they encountered Bundy, as many have claimed to have narrowly escaped him. While it is possible that something similar happened to Harry, it is unlikely that it involved Bundy.

178,"### Context: The article discusses a study that examines the benefits of early treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The study, supported by drug manufacturer Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, focuses on the use of interferon beta-1b, marketed as Betaseron, as a treatment option. The news release does not mention the cost of the treatment, but it is noted that the price of interferon beta has been rising faster than inflation.

One concern raised is that some insurers are no longer covering certain forms of interferon beta-A, such as Avonex. The release does not mention any potential harms of treatment, but it is noted that therapy with interferon beta-1b can have significant side effects, including depression and thoughts of suicide.

The study involved over 400 patients and was a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome results, which showed the percentage of patients who had relapses at 11 years, were not statistically significant. The release does not mention this result, which represented a 16% relative rate reduction and a 6% absolute rate reduction.

The release acknowledges one limitation of the study, which is that all participants received treatment after the placebo-control phase, so there was no untreated control group. It is also mentioned that many of the researchers involved in the study have financial ties to Bayer, including stock, royalties, consulting, speaking, honoraria, travel, and salaried employment.

The release states that the study adds to the evidence supporting early treatment for MS and that it has a long-lasting effect on disease activity. However, starting treatment after one event, rather than waiting for further events, could lead to a larger market for the drug. It is noted that there are currently 20 drugs available for treating MS.

Overall, the release does not mention the cost of the treatment, potential harms, or the statistically insignificant primary outcome results. It also does not disclose the financial ties between the researchers and Bayer. While it provides some information about the study, there are limitations and concerns that are not adequately addressed.
Claim: Treating at the Earliest Sign of MS May Offer Long-Term Benefit
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This release summarizes a study that followed 11-year treatment outcomes of two groups of patients with early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). All of the patients had experienced a first episode suggestive of MS, called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), and a  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan suggesting MS. Up to 85 percent of people with CIS go on to develop MS. The two patient groups were randomized to either receive interferon beta-1 by injection immediately or receive a placebo for two years. After two years, the placebo group could receive their treatment of choice. The patients who received the drug immediately appeared to have fewer relapses over the 11 years of study, according to the lead author, but no advantages were observed in other patient outcomes such as overall disability and MRI scans. The release would have been stronger if it provided more context for judging the reduced number of relapses, especially in light of the two groups showing no difference in disability. The release also omitted mention of significant potential conflicts of interest, the high annual cost of interferon beta-1 and the drug’s side effects. Society faces tough questions because of the high prices of drugs that target the immune system, such as interferon beta-1b for multiple sclerosis. This news release suggests drug therapy should begin sooner for patients without including any of the controversy on cost playing out in the United States and Europe. Last year authors of a different research study, also published in Neurology, called the rise in MS drug prices “alarming” and wrote it was also puzzling, since some of the drugs are not new. “Why the costs of MS DMTs [disease modifying therapies] in the United States have risen so dramatically is uncertain. However, the simplest explanation is that pharmaceutical companies raise prices of new and old MS DMTs in the United States to increase profits and our health care system puts no limits on these increases,’ they wrote. Why is cost so important to mention? This drug study, in particular, has significant potential conflicts of interest, discussed below under the Funding Sources & Conflict of Interest Disclosure criteria.",Treating at the Earliest Sign of MS May Offer Long-Term Benefit,"This news release describes a study of 400 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who were randomly assigned to receive either the drug interferon beta-1b (marketed as Betaseron) or a placebo for 11 years. The study found that patients who started treatment after their first symptoms had a lower rate of relapses than those who waited until they had a second symptom before starting treatment. The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it doesn’t mention the cost of the drug, which is important because the study found that starting treatment after one event, rather than waiting for further events, could lead to a larger market for the drug. The release also doesn’t mention the study’s limitations, such as the fact that all participants received treatment after the placebo-control phase, so there was no untreated control group. The release also doesn’t mention that many of the study authors have financial ties to the drug’s manufacturer, Bayer. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is estimated that 2.3 million people worldwide have MS. The disease is unpredictable and varies in severity. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, and loss of coordination. There is currently no cure for MS, but there are several drugs available to treat the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. The study described in this news release adds to the evidence supporting early treatment for MS. However, it’s important for readers to know that the"
179,"### Context: The claim that reusing, freezing, or warming plastic water bottles will cause them to break down into carcinogenic compounds or release dioxins is inaccurate. The American Chemistry Council states that the plastic additive DEHA is not used in the manufacture of PET bottles, and it is not classified as a human carcinogen. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has evaluated DEHA and concluded that it is unlikely to cause cancer. The Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research conducted a study on plastic water bottles and found that DEHA levels were below the World Health Organization guidelines for safe drinking water.

The claim that freezing water in plastic bottles releases dioxins is also false. Dioxins are only formed at temperatures well above freezing, and there is no scientific basis for expecting dioxins to be present in plastic food or beverage containers.

However, there are concerns about other chemicals in plastic bottles. Phthalates, which are sometimes added to plastics to make them flexible, can leach into water and food when plastics are heated. Phthalates can act as endocrine disruptors and have hormone-like behavior. Bisphenol A (BPA), another chemical used in some plastic bottles, has been linked to cancer and reproductive damage in animals. BPA bans have been implemented for products intended for children, and some consumers seek out non-BPA alternatives.

In summary, the claim that reusing, freezing, or warming plastic water bottles causes them to break down into carcinogenic compounds or release dioxins is not supported by scientific evidence. However, there are concerns about other chemicals in plastic bottles, such as phthalates and BPA, which can leach into liquids when the bottles are heated.

180,"### Context: The claim that Winston Churchill was born in a ladies' room during a dance has been circulating on internet trivia lists. However, researching this claim reveals that it is not entirely accurate. According to biographies of Churchill, he was born two months prematurely in a bleak-looking bedroom at Blenheim Palace. His mother, Lady Randolph Churchill, had taken a fall while walking with a shooting party, which brought on the pains of labor. She was rushed back to the palace, where Churchill was born in the early hours of November 30, 1874, with the assistance of a country doctor. 

Some biographies suggest that the story of Churchill's premature birth was concocted to cover up a pre-marital pregnancy. There are hints that Lady Randolph Churchill may have been pregnant at the time of her wedding, which was a discreet and rushed affair. The absence of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, along with the rushed nature of the wedding, suggests that Lady Randolph may have already been pregnant. The birth notices in the newspaper reported Churchill's birth as premature, but it was widely believed that he was full-term. 

One biography mentions that on the evening of Churchill's birth, a dance called the St. Andrew's Ball was held at Blenheim Palace. Lady Randolph Churchill appeared at the dance in a loose gown and dance card. She was on the dance floor when the pains of labor started. She then stumbled away from the party and was carried into a small room off the palace's great hall, which was temporarily used as a ladies' cloakroom. She gave birth to Churchill in this room, with the assistance of a Woodstock physician. 

However, it is important to note that Churchill was not actually born until more than 24 hours after the dance had ended and all the guests had departed. Additionally, the room where the birth took place was not a ladies' bathroom but ordinary living quarters temporarily used to store coats. Photographs of Blenheim Palace confirm this. The confusion may arise from the fact that ""cloakroom"" is sometimes used as a euphemism for ""lavatory"" in the UK, but in this case, it was used in its literal sense. 

In conclusion, while there are elements of truth to the claim that Churchill was born during a dance, the details have been exaggerated. He was born prematurely in a bedroom at Blenheim Palace, and his mother may have attended a dance before going into labor. However, he was not born until more than 24 hours later, and the room where the birth took place was not a ladies' bathroom but a temporary storage area for coats.

However, veterinarians at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine were able to revive him, which is a rare occurrence. Research shows that animals whose hearts have stopped only live full, healthy lives 5% of the time, but the team of veterinarians is confident that Neo will be among them, despite needing a leg amputation. Typically, animals that are revived need to be on a mechanical ventilator, but Neo did not require one. Ford had let Neo outside on his property in White Springs, Florida, and when Neo didn't come back, Ford left the front door open for him. Later that night, Ford heard a thud on the front porch and found Neo covered in bite marks and losing blood. The veterinarians assured Ford that Neo would adapt to having three legs, and Ford believes that Neo will be fine.

182,"### Context: The claim that Muslim nurses in Britain are excused from washing their hands before medical procedures is false. This claim originated in 2010 on the website of the far-right British National Party, but it has been debunked multiple times since then. The original story misrepresented the recommendations from the United Kingdom's Department of Health regarding uniforms for healthcare workers. The department recommended that uniforms can include long sleeves when workers are not directly caring for patients, and disposable forearm covers can be used when gloves are also being used. However, the guidance clearly states that strict procedures for washing hands and wrists must still be observed. This requirement for hand washing is emphasized at least twice in the document. 

Despite the clear guidelines, the false claim has resurfaced multiple times over the years, including in 2013, 2014, and 2016. In March 2018, it appeared on a website called hardcoreUSAnews.com, which falsely stated that Muslim nurses in the UK have been granted the option of participating in medical operations without washing their hands. This recent version of the false claim was posted on a Facebook page called World Against Terrorism, which has over 35,000 followers. However, some Facebook users flagged the story as potentially false, and it has been confirmed to be inaccurate.

In conclusion, the claim that Muslim nurses in Britain are excused from washing their hands before medical procedures is a misrepresentation that has been circulating online since 2010. The original story was based on a false claim from the British National Party, and the actual recommendations from the Department of Health clearly state that strict procedures for hand washing must be observed.

183,"### Context: The ceremony harkens back to a time when early Chinese settlers to Taiwan used to pray to mountain gods and local deities for protection against wild animals and other threats. Each new year, the fattened pigs are slaughtered and the carcasses decorated and paraded through the streets of Sanxia, a traditional district in northern Taiwan, to the temple. The owner of the biggest pig wins the competition and with it an auspicious sign that the year to come will be a lucky one. “This is a custom at our Tzu Shih Yeh (founder ancestor) temple in Sanxia. We cannot abolish this tradition,” said Liu Ching-sheng, owner of this year’s winning pig. Animal protection groups say the process of fattening the animals — a pig raised for the ceremony can weigh more than 800 kg (1763 lbs) compared to a normal weight of 120 kg — is cruel. “Just like for us humans, obesity in animals is a disease,” Chen Yu-min, director of the Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan, told Reuters Television. She said the pigs’ movements are restricted while they are fattened and the additional weight puts a strain on their internal organs. “In addition to the inhumane process of fattening is the last moment when they are about to be slaughtered. This moment is actually very cruel and inhumane,” she said.

Putin claimed that business associates of William Browder sent a ""huge amount of money - 400 million - as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton."" However, there is no evidence to support this claim. Browder is no longer a U.S. citizen and those affiliated with a U.S. investment firm linked to Browder gave just $17,700 to Clinton's campaign in 2016. Putin also made an offer for special counsel Robert S. Mueller to come to Russia to observe questioning of the 12 Russian military intelligence agents indicted for hacking into Democratic Party and Clinton campaign computer networks, but in exchange, Putin wanted Russian law enforcement to be able to sit in on interviews with U.S. officers of law enforcement and intelligence services. Putin mentioned Browder in relation to this offer. Browder, founder and CEO of investment firm Hermitage Capital Management, denied Putin's allegations about funneling money to the Clinton campaign, stating that he is not a U.S. citizen and does not make campaign contributions. Putin also denied that a video shown during his annual state of the nation address depicted nuclear warheads raining down on Florida, but it did. The video enraged President Trump, as it showed warheads hitting Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago club. The video was seen as deliberately provocative and an escalation of the arms race. Overall, Putin's claims regarding Browder's contributions to Clinton's campaign and the video depicting warheads hitting Florida were false and misleading.

185,"### Context: Nearly 1,100 employees are being laid off at Ohio Valley Medical Center (OVMC) in Wheeling and East Ohio Regional Hospital in Martins Ferry, Ohio. The closure of these hospitals is a blow to the region, which has not fully benefited from the economic recovery that President Donald Trump has touted. Alecto Healthcare Services, the owner of the hospitals, cited losses of over $37 million, increasing facility improvement needs, and the lack of a potential partner or buyer as reasons for the closure. The closure of the hospitals will have a significant impact on the local economy, as the region has already experienced a steady decline in population and job opportunities. The closure of the hospitals will also affect businesses in the area that cater to hospital workers and patients' families. The closure of OVMC will particularly impact the psychiatric unit, which is the only one of its kind within a 75-mile radius. The unit provides care for adults and children with mental health issues, and its closure would be tragic for the patients. The closure of the hospitals will also force doctors to seek employment elsewhere. The unemployment rate in the area is slightly above the state average but lower than surrounding counties. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources and Governor Jim Justice are working to ensure that there is no lapse in quality care for patients transferred to other facilities and that services provided by OVMC remain available in the community. However, calls to the hospital and the parent company about the welfare of the patients were not returned. Many employees are angry and uncertain about their future job prospects. Some have already started looking for jobs in Pittsburgh. Overall, the closure of the hospitals will have a significant impact on the local community and economy, leaving many employees without jobs and patients without access to essential healthcare services.

The article states that there is no public record of Conte making the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. In a Twitter thread from March 17, Conte acknowledged the difficulties that Italy has faced in the past and expressed confidence in the country's ability to overcome the coronavirus pandemic. His tweets reflect a different tone than the defeatist message in the Facebook quote.

The article concludes by stating that a search for the quote attributed to Conte using news archives and online search engines yielded no results. Therefore, the claim made in the Facebook post is false.

187,"### Context: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has faced criticism for his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept COVID-19 positive patients. However, it is important to note that nursing homes were not actually forced to accept these patients, but many felt they had no other choice. The policy was implemented to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in New York. Between March 25 and May 8, approximately 6,326 COVID-positive patients were admitted to nursing homes in the state.

Critics argue that Cuomo's policy contributed to the high death toll in nursing homes, which accounted for 26% of the state's COVID-19 deaths. However, a July analysis by the state concluded that the virus was introduced by nursing home staff members rather than sick patients. The report suggested that the policy could not have been a driver of nursing home infections or fatalities.

Epidemiologists and nursing home advocates disagree with the report's conclusion, stating that introducing COVID-19 positive patients to nursing homes did contribute to the spread of the virus and deaths. They argue that infection control is a longstanding problem in nursing homes and that the policy exacerbated the situation.

While public health experts have differing opinions on the extent to which Cuomo's policy contributed to nursing home deaths, they generally agree that nursing home staff members and visitors were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in these facilities.

In conclusion, while nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-19 positive patients, they were not actually forced to do so. The governor's policy aimed to free up hospital beds, but its impact on nursing home deaths is still unclear. Infection control issues in nursing homes and the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients likely played a role in the spread of the virus, but it is difficult to determine the exact extent of the policy's responsibility.
Claim: “Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?”
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. In May, the governor amended the March order, prohibiting hospitals from discharging patients to nursing homes unless they tested negative for COVID-19. The state health department issued a report in July that concluded the deadly coronavirus was introduced by nursing home staffers rather than sick patients. Though some epidemiologists and nursing home advocates questioned the report’s methods and findings, public health experts agreed with the report’s conclusion — based on the timeline — that nursing home staffers and visitors, before they were banned, were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in nursing homes.",“Does the #DemConvention know @NYGovCuomo forced nursing homes across NY to take in COVID positive patients and planted the seeds of infection that killed thousands of grandmothers and grandfathers?”,"Some nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-19 patients, but they were not forced to do so.

188,"### Context: Biogen, a biotechnology company, has announced that it will seek U.S. approval for its Alzheimer's drug, aducanumab, early next year. This comes as a surprising reversal after the company had terminated two large clinical trials of the drug in March, stating that they were likely to fail. However, as researchers studied data from a larger pool of patients who received the drug, they began to question the initial conclusion. Biogen kept its own trial investigators and committee overseeing the trial unaware of the possibility that some patients had benefited from high doses of the therapy. The company brought in outside Alzheimer's experts and statisticians to help analyze the new findings and sought feedback from U.S. regulators on whether the drug could be considered for approval.

The decision to seek approval for aducanumab has raised hopes for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and Biogen's shares gained 27% on investor optimism. However, Wall Street analysts doubt whether Biogen's analysis will pass muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) without an additional years-long trial to confirm the findings. Many Alzheimer's researchers are also questioning why one trial appeared to succeed while another with the same design failed. Experts are reserving judgment until Biogen presents more detailed data in December.

Biogen's earlier decision to terminate the trials was seen as the end of the ""amyloid hypothesis,"" which suggests that removing a protein associated with Alzheimer's could prevent the disease. The March announcement also raised concerns about another therapy, BAN2401, which works similarly to aducanumab. Biogen is partnering with Japan's Eisai on both drugs, and the revival of aducanumab is expected to energize enrollment in a late-stage study of BAN2401.

The two aducanumab trials, Engage and Emerge, started a month apart in 2015 and each had about 1,640 patients. Changes were made in the trial that expanded the number of patients receiving a higher dose. In March, the therapy appeared to be a failure, but patients continued to receive treatment. It was later discovered that some patients who received a higher dose for longer showed a benefit in the Emerge study.

During the months of analysis, trial investigators were kept in the dark about the new findings. Biogen asked them to sign non-disclosure agreements before sharing the new analysis. Many experts are still questioning why only one trial succeeded while the other did not.

Overall, Biogen's decision to seek approval for aducanumab has brought renewed hope for Alzheimer's patients, but doubts remain about the FDA's acceptance of the analysis and the discrepancy between the two trials. More detailed data is expected to be presented in December.

189,"### Context: The claim is about a story that circulated in 2004, stating that a Muslim man in Egypt killed his wife and buried her along with their infant baby and 8-year-old daughter, who were still alive. The story claims that the girls were miraculously fed and comforted by Jesus until they were rescued 15 days later. The story also mentions that the incident caused outrage in the country and that the man would be executed.

However, upon investigation, no news reports from Egypt about such an incident were found. The story has been shared through email and labeled as ""News from Egypt,"" ""Miracle in Egypt,"" and ""Murder Miracle in Egypt!"" Snopes.com, a fact-checking website, received the story in April 2004 and found no evidence to support its claims.

The story attributes the survival of the girls to a man wearing shiny white clothes with bleeding wounds in his hands, whom the older girl identifies as Jesus. The story suggests that this miracle challenges Muslim beliefs about Jesus and his crucifixion.

The origins of the story are unclear. Some versions of the email identify the writer as a woman whose husband is a Christian pastor involved in a Muslim outreach program. However, it is revealed that the woman did not write the account but received it from an unnamed source. The details of the story were supposedly confirmed by the woman's family in Egypt, but it is unknown what was asked and how it was answered.

In conclusion, the claim about Muslim girls being buried alive by their father and being fed and comforted by Jesus until rescuers arrived is not supported by any credible evidence. The story circulated through email in 2004 but has no basis in reality.

190,"### Context: Former Vice President Joe Biden has been criticized for making verbal missteps during his presidential campaign. A Facebook post mocked Biden for allegedly claiming that 150 million Americans died from gun violence and another 120 million died from COVID-19. While the post is clearly a joke, it raises the question of whether Biden actually made these claims.

Biden did make these claims on two separate occasions, although he corrected himself immediately in one instance. On June 25, 2020, during a campaign event in Pennsylvania, Biden was discussing healthcare coverage with families. An attendee mentioned the financial and mental health stress caused by hospital treatments and the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden responded by saying, ""Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID, I mean, 120,000 dead from COVID,"" according to audio obtained by Snopes.com.

During the final Democratic primary debate on February 25, 2020, in South Carolina, Biden made the claim that 150 million Americans died from gun violence since 2007. However, he immediately corrected himself by saying he meant to say 150,000 people. Biden's campaign later clarified that he intended to say thousands, not millions.

In both cases, Biden or his staff acknowledged the mistake and clarified that he meant to say thousands, not millions. The Facebook post is correct in stating that Biden made these claims, but it fails to mention that he corrected himself regarding the COVID data error. At the time of his statement on June 25, 2020, the COVID death toll was over 119,000, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center dashboard.

The claim made in the Facebook post that Biden said 120 million Americans died from COVID-19 and 150 million Americans died from gun violence since 2007 is drastically incorrect. Biden intended to say ""thousands"" in both cases, not ""millions."" The post accurately highlights that Biden made these claims, but it fails to acknowledge his immediate correction of the COVID data error.

191,"### Context: At least 57 people have died in Japan due to soaring temperatures since late July, raising concerns about the health threat to athletes and fans at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. A 50-year-old construction worker, who had been working on the renovation of Tokyo Big Sight, the media center for the Olympics, was found unconscious and later died in the hospital. While the exact cause of death is unknown, heatstroke is suspected. Temperatures in Tokyo have been consistently high, with daily highs averaging 34.8 degrees Celsius in August. Across Japan, 57 people died from the heat between July 29 and August 4, and over 18,000 were hospitalized. In Tokyo alone, 45 people have died since August 1, many of them elderly individuals living alone. Tokyo 2020 organizers have urged all those working on Games venues to take necessary precautions and have instructed construction companies to implement health and safety measures. Restrooms with air-conditioning, water coolers, ice makers, and other amenities have been set up at construction sites. Despite the heat, Tokyo Big Sight was operational for a comic book and anime convention, with fans queuing outside in the heat. Some individuals had to be escorted away in wheelchairs due to heat-related issues. The organizers plan to address the heat issue during the Olympics by providing shaded rest areas, mist sprays, ice packs, and tents at security checkpoints. The start times for the men's and women's marathons have been moved to 6:00 a.m. as an additional precaution. Tokyo previously hosted the Olympics in 1964, but the Games were held in October to avoid the heat. However, due to international broadcasting and sports schedules, such shifts are no longer possible. The Olympics in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 were held in the summer despite the hot climates. The Tokyo Olympics will take place from July 24 to August 9, 2020.

192,"### Context: The claim that the Oklahoma Highway Patrol is using a device called ERAD to seize money from people's bank accounts is misleading. The ERAD devices purchased by the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety are not capable of taking money directly out of bank accounts. These devices are designed to work with prepaid cards, not traditional bank accounts. The ERAD group, the manufacturer of the devices, explains that they are used to identify the value of prepaid cash cards, freeze the funds, and seize the money at the point of arrest. The devices were purchased to address the issue of prepaid cash cards being used to transport illicit proceeds that may not be in proximity to contraband. 

Civil forfeiture is a major issue in Oklahoma, with law enforcement officials arguing that it is necessary to curb drug trafficking. Critics, however, claim that innocent people are often affected by these seizures. The ERAD devices, along with current civil forfeiture laws in the state, allow officers to check, freeze, and seize funds on prepaid cards. While law enforcement officials can't wipe out anyone's bank account with an ERAD, they can use these devices to target funds on prepaid cards.

The article highlights the concerns raised by critics of civil asset forfeiture, who argue that the practice is often overused and violates people's due process and property rights. State Senator Kyle Loveless, a Republican, has spearheaded an unsuccessful push to overhaul Oklahoma's civil forfeiture laws. He has expressed concerns about innocent people having their assets seized and the misspending of seized funds.

In summary, the claim that the Oklahoma Highway Patrol is using ERAD devices to seize money from people's bank accounts is not accurate. The ERAD devices are specifically designed to work with prepaid cards, not traditional bank accounts. However, they do allow officers to check, freeze, and seize funds on prepaid cards, which has raised concerns about civil asset forfeiture and its impact on innocent individuals.

193,"### Context: There is a possibility that if Eli Lilly and Co. were to sell or spin off Elanco Animal Health, the operation may not remain in Greenfield, Indiana. Elanco has been present in the city since the late 19th century. The CEO of Lilly, David Ricks, stated that a decision regarding Elanco's future would likely be announced by July. Elanco produces vaccines, antibiotics, food additives, and other health products for livestock and pets. It currently employs around 775 people at its campus in Greenfield. The mayor of Greenfield, Chuck Fewell, expressed concern about losing the business, as Elanco is considered a great corporate partner. Elanco experienced a 2% decrease in revenue last year and is also losing market share to competitors such as Zoetis and Bayer. This decline occurred just as the company was expecting increased sales and profits following its acquisition of Novartis' animal health division in 2015 for $5.4 billion. Elanco officials estimate that sales for 2018 will be ""flat to slightly up,"" but they believe that new and recent launches will gradually improve the business. Elanco's President, Jeff Simmons, stated that they expect 2018 to be a year of transition as they continue to evolve their product mix against challenges.

194,"### Context: The claim that people in California applied sunscreen to their eyeballs during the August 2017 solar eclipse is based on an unverified account from a single person. The report quotes a local nurse practitioner in Redding, California, who claimed that patients had presented at their clinic with eye pain after putting sunscreen in their eyes because they did not have protective glasses to watch the eclipse. However, the nurse practitioner could not be reached for evidence or to speak to the colleague who allegedly told her about the patients.

Attempts were made to verify this claim by contacting other ophthalmologists and urgent care clinics in Redding, California, as well as in 13 other cities across the United States where the eclipse coverage was similar. None of these medical professionals reported seeing any patients who had applied sunscreen to their eyes. Only one clinic mentioned seeing a few patients with eye damage from the eclipse.

Therefore, it is not possible to confirm whether anyone in the Redding, California area actually applied sunscreen to their eyes during the solar eclipse. There is a possibility of miscommunication or misunderstanding at various stages, including between the nurse practitioner and the reporter, between the nurse practitioner and her colleague, and between the colleague and others if they were not present when the patients presented themselves.

In conclusion, the claim that people in California applied sunscreen to their eyeballs during the solar eclipse is based on an unverified account from a single person. Attempts to verify this claim by contacting medical professionals in the area and other similar locations did not yield any evidence of such cases.

Chippi believes that the recent legalization of marijuana in Colorado is ""fake"" because it remains prohibited by federal law, putting users at risk of prosecution and jail time. The proposal for sanctuary status is based on the ""sanctuary city"" laws that protected Central and Southern American refugees from deportation in the 1980s. Chippi argues that just like with immigration policy, there needs to be a place where people can be protected. She founded the Closer to the Heart Cannabis Ministry, which has over 300 members who believe marijuana is the Biblical Tree of Life and its use is a sacrament. Chippi opened Nederland's first medical pot dispensary in 2009 but closed it the following year due to regulations she viewed as a violation of sick people's constitutional rights. She has since sued the state six times seeking changes in the rules and greater clarity for users and caregivers. The proposed sanctuary ordinance, drafted by Denver attorney Danyel Joffe, would prohibit the town from using funds to enforce any marijuana law affecting therapeutic or spiritual uses of cannabis, as long as its use harmed no one else. The town of Nederland, with a population of about 1,500, is known for its quirky, easy-going ambiance and has previously hosted events such as the Frozen Dead Guy Days festival.

Britain’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said in draft guidance published on Friday that Strimvelis gene therapy used against adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA-SCID, improves overall survival compared with standard stem cell transplant therapy. The inherited condition disables the immune system and without treatment, children with ADA-SCID need to be kept in isolation to avoid infections – hence it has become known as the  “bubble baby” or “bubble boy” syndrome. “Strimvelis represents an important development in the treatment of ADA-SCID, offering the potential to cure the immune aspects of the condition and avoid some of the disadvantages of current treatments,” NICE said. “Costing 594,000 euros, the treatment is usually given once only and the effects are thought to be life-long,” it added. The draft guidance marks the first time NICE has applied its new cost effectiveness limits for treatments for very rare conditions.

The ban, which was implemented by Republican Governor Charlie Baker in response to the outbreak of lung illnesses and deaths linked to e-cigarette use, has faced legal challenges from vape shops and an industry group. The plaintiffs argued that the ban was arbitrary and violated state constitutional principles. However, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled that lifting the ban immediately would go against the public interest. He stated that the proper procedure for adopting an emergency regulation, which includes a public hearing, must be followed. If the state does not go through this procedure, the ban will end next Monday. Judge Wilkins emphasized the importance of input from affected industries and the public as a safeguard against executive abuse of discretion. Governor Baker acknowledged that the courts would likely be involved in the process and expressed his belief that the public health issues associated with vaping outweighed the negative consequences of the ban. The governor's administration will now work with the state attorney general's office to determine the next steps. The Vapor Technology Association, an industry group, expressed satisfaction with the judge's recognition that they are likely to prevail in court. However, they expressed disappointment that the ban will remain in place for another week while the state considers alternative regulations.

Fakhrurrozi's mission is crucial because there are still many residents who are unaware of the coronavirus and its impact.

Fakhrurrozi is supported by three volunteers, including Askar Kustiwa, who joined him to help spread awareness about the virus. The doctor and his team take precautions by using raincoats and masks as makeshift protective gear. They believe that it is their responsibility to provide education and support to the community during this challenging time.

In summary, Fakhrurrozi, along with three volunteers, has taken it upon himself to educate his community about COVID-19 in Indonesia. With the increasing number of cases and deaths in the country, their mission has gained more significance. They emphasize the importance of people staying at home, practicing social distancing, and maintaining cleanliness. While the country has not implemented a complete lockdown, some provincial governments have urged people to stay home. Fakhrurrozi's efforts are crucial because many residents are still unaware of the virus and its impact.

202,"### Context: Over 1,000 people have been placed under quarantine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State-LA) due to a measles scare. The quarantine was ordered by Los Angeles County after five cases of measles were reported in the county and 38 cases in California. The outbreak is largely attributed to parents not vaccinating their children due to misinformation about the dangers of vaccines. The quarantine requires those affected to stay at home, avoid contact with others, and refrain from using public transportation. Violators of the quarantine could face prosecution. So far, everyone has been cooperating with the order. 

At Cal State-LA, 875 students, staff, faculty, and visitors were placed under quarantine, with 250 cleared by Friday after proving their immunity to measles. UCLA had 129 students and faculty quarantined, with all but 46 cleared by Friday. Some UCLA students were provided with a quarantine area to stay in. The quarantine was imposed based on possible exposure to infected individuals who had attended classes at UCLA or visited the Cal State-LA library. The quarantine is expected to end on Tuesday at UCLA and Thursday at Cal State-LA.

Lawmakers in California, New York, Washington state, and Oregon are responding to the outbreak by tightening vaccination exemption rules. President Donald Trump also urged everyone to get vaccinated. The majority of measles cases are concentrated in two ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. In response, Rockland County declared a state of emergency and attempted to bar unvaccinated children from public places, but the order was overturned by a judge. Mandatory vaccinations were ordered in affected Brooklyn neighborhoods, with fines of $1,000 for non-compliance.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and swelling of the brain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the measles vaccine for everyone over a year old, except for those who have had the disease before. Health officials are urging people to get vaccinated, emphasizing that the vaccine is safe and effective.

203,"### Context: A new case of Ebola has been confirmed in Beni, a community in the Democratic Republic of Congo that had been the epicenter of the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. This new case comes after nearly 42 days without a reported case, which is the required period of time for the outbreak to be declared over. The World Health Organization (WHO) had been preparing for and expecting more cases, but the news was met with sadness and disappointment.

Health workers in Congo had been awaiting the end of the Ebola outbreak while also bracing for the arrival of the coronavirus. Two cases of coronavirus had already been reported in Beni. Mike Ryan, the emergencies chief for the WHO, stated that there is no exit strategy until you are in control of the situation, and one must always be ready to start again.

The current Ebola outbreak, which was declared in August 2018, has been particularly challenging due to deadly rebel attacks, community suspicion, and weak infrastructure in remote areas. Some Ebola responders have been attacked and killed. However, the use of experimental Ebola vaccines has been a welcome development in fighting the disease.

The news of the new Ebola case has devastated the communities in eastern Congo, who are already under threat from the coronavirus outbreak, ongoing conflict, and displacement. Health workers had already shifted their efforts towards fighting the coronavirus, making this new development even more challenging.

In conclusion, a new case of Ebola has been reported in Beni, Congo, just days before the expected end of the outbreak. This news is disheartening for the communities already facing multiple health crises and challenges.

204,"### Context: The article discusses the controversy surrounding the confiscation of rosaries from immigrants at the United States border. The image of the confiscated rosaries went viral in 2018, sparking outrage over the treatment of migrants in the country. However, the image was not new and was taken from a gallery published in 2017 by photographer Thomas Kiefer, who used to work as a janitor for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in Arizona.

Kiefer explained that the rosaries, along with other personal belongings, were taken from immigrants when they were arrested by border agents. He collected these items from trash cans while cleaning. The confiscated items became part of his photography collection called ""El Sueño Americano."" Kiefer's experience of collecting and photographing these items changed his perspective on his job and made him aware of the human dramas playing out around him.

The article mentions that CBP's confiscation policies apply to all items classified as ""non-essential"" or ""potentially lethal."" However, many of these confiscated items, including cell phones, wallets, and cash, end up in the trash and are never returned to their owners. CBP spokesman Carlos Diaz stated that items can be returned if the owner retrieves them, but immigrant advocacy organization No More Deaths claims that many never see their belongings again.

According to No More Deaths, personal property is generally held for 30 days after an arrest and then destroyed. This includes religious effects, among other items, except for the clothing being worn. The failure to return belongings upon deportation is seen as a violation of law enforcement standards and human rights norms.

The article also mentions that immigrants are often deported with only the clothes on their back, as their belongings, including cell phones, identification cards, cash, and medication, are confiscated and not returned. The author reached out to CBP for more information on their policy and how items are returned but did not receive a response.

In summary, the article highlights the controversy surrounding the confiscation of rosaries and other personal belongings from immigrants at the U.S. border. It discusses the work of photographer Thomas Kiefer, who collected and photographed these items, shedding light on the broader issue of the government's confiscation policies and the failure to return belongings to their owners.

Some airlines have suspended change fees for new ticket reservations in an attempt to attract hesitant travelers. JetBlue Airways was the first to offer free rebooking options, followed by other major US airlines. However, travelers are still unsatisfied as the policies do not guarantee money-back refunds. The US Travel Association predicts a 6% decline in international travel to the United States over the next three months, the largest decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. To compensate for the decline in international travel, major US airlines are deploying extra widebody jets on domestic routes. European carriers have also warned of the negative impact of the epidemic on growth. Ryanair's CEO expects a decline in the spread of the virus after Easter, leading to seat promotions and sales to stimulate travel. In the Asia-Pacific region, Malaysian budget airline AirAsia X has launched a one-year pass for unlimited trips to certain destinations. Fares on routes not directly affected by travel bans have also softened, with some routes experiencing a 25% decrease in fares compared to the same period last year. Vietnam Airlines is offering $0 round-trip fares to stimulate tourism. Analysts believe that airlines are willing to reduce prices to stimulate demand, particularly in the leisure travel sector.

207,"### Context: A recent clinical trial has found that a cream containing 5% fluorouracil (5-FU) can significantly reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a type of skin cancer. The study, funded by the Veterans Administration, involved 932 participants and spanned several years. Half of the participants received the 5-FU cream while the other half received a cream without the active ingredient.

The results showed that after the first year, only five out of 468 veterans who used the 5-FU cream developed SCC that required surgery, compared to 20 out of 464 veterans in the control group. This represents a statistically significant 75% reduction in risk. However, for the subsequent three years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients requiring surgical treatment for SCC.

The cream does have common side effects, including reddened, sensitive, and crusty skin, which resolve when the cream is discontinued. After six months of use, 21% of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as severe, while 40% rated them as moderate.

The cost of the 5-FU cream is not mentioned in the release, but according to GoodRx, it ranges from $73 to $136 for a 40g tube at different pharmacy retailers. Insurance plans may reduce the cost, but this is not addressed in the release. It is worth noting that at least 11 patients need to be treated with the cream to potentially prevent one additional cancer, resulting in a drug cost of over $14,000.

The release does not provide context on the nature of SCC or the burden it puts on patients or the healthcare system. It also fails to mention that several members of the research team received support from pharmaceutical firms, although there is no indication that this influenced the trial's conclusions.

The study acknowledges that surgery is the usual response to these skin cancers, with Mohs surgery being the preferred procedure in many cases. It also mentions that current means of preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients, such as sunscreen or oral medications, are available.

The release quotes the study author expressing hope for future studies that may show better regimens over time. Further research is planned.

Overall, the release provides information on the effectiveness of the 5-FU cream in reducing SCC risk but lacks details on cost, context, and potential conflicts of interest.
Claim: In clinical trial, cream reduces squamous cell carcinoma risk
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Getty Images This release reports on a large multi-center clinical trial intended to gauge the preventative value of using a cream containing 5 percent fluorouacil as a means of reducing the occurrence of both squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinomas. It says that the cream appears to reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinomas among the elderly veterans in the trial by 75 percent, although it has no statistically significant effect on reducing basal cell carcinomas. The release also states that the protection appears to only extend for the first year. The release omits mention of the drug’s hefty price tag but it does clearly state both the benefits and the risks of using the medicinal cream. These skin cancers — squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas — are among the most common forms of cancer afflicting Americans and to date, the only effective preventative has been the use of sunscreen with varying success. This trial suggest a two-to-four week-long application of this cream can reduce the risk of developing one kind of skin cancer by as much as 75 percent for one year. Given the costs of treating these cancers, both in money and resources, this finding, if borne out, is a positive step in reducing the burden that cancer places on society.","In clinical trial, cream reduces squamous cell carcinoma risk","This news release describes a clinical trial that found a cream containing the active ingredient fluorouracil (5-FU) can significantly reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in high-risk patients.

208,"### Context: The article discusses a claim that carjackers are using a scheme where they place flyers or $100 bills on car windows to lure drivers out of their vehicles, allowing the carjackers to steal the cars. The claim has been circulating on the internet since at least 2004. However, the article states that there is no evidence of any documented instances of car thefts following this specific script. Law enforcement contacts have noted that while the described method could be used by carjackers, they are unfamiliar with any cases of cars being taken in this manner. Carjackings are generally crimes of opportunity, committed by individuals in need of quick cash or young people seeking thrills or participating in gang initiations. Carjackers typically target occupied vehicles and force the drivers out, rather than using the method described in the claim. The article also mentions that the claim gained credibility when it was forwarded by members of the law enforcement community, but it was later revealed that the emails were not official statements from the police departments mentioned. The claim has been debunked by various police departments, including the Florissant Police Department in Missouri and the New Zealand Police. They have stated that the claim is an urban myth and that it is not good practice to exit a vehicle with keys in the ignition, the engine running, and valuables inside. The article concludes by mentioning that the claim has been attributed to different police officers in various locations, but there is no evidence to support the claim.

But again, the whole news story was based on nothing more than someone at the attorney general’s office saying they had “gotten reports of scammers in Maryland leaving $100 bills on windshields” and provided no documented instance of such a crime actually having taken place. The attorney general’s office told us they had received only a single (unconfirmed) report of this supposed crime wave, but “due to the severity of the issue, we have reported it to make people aware of it.”","Parking lot carjackers are placing flyers or $100 bills on the windows of automobiles, then taking the cars when drivers step out of their vehicles to remove them.",Police: Carjackers don’t use $100 bills to lure drivers out of their vehicles
209,"### Context: A recent study has found that breast-feeding premature infants may help reduce the risk of a serious eye problem known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The study, which was a reanalysis of five previously published studies, showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP, but did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. The study only looked at a mother's own breast milk, not donor milk. The article notes that the greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries. The article also mentions that the study did not compare the costs of breast milk and formula, as both feeding methods entail costs that are beyond the scope of the coverage. The article recommends reporting the drop in odds of ROP more precisely, as there are many different combinations of variables being compared in the study. It suggests that the second comparison, which has the largest sample size, should have been reported instead of the fourth comparison. The article also suggests that more precision is needed regarding the specific comparison being made, as the statistics cited fail to mention that the comparison is between exclusive human milk and exclusive formula. The article praises the inclusion of limitations of the study, such as the fact that it only looked at a mother's own breast milk and not donor milk. However, it criticizes the use of phrases that suggest a cause-and-effect relationship, when the study only showed an association. The article concludes by questioning the choice to end with a quote from an independent source that suggests breast-feeding as long as possible, as the study's conclusion is more tentative. Overall, the article provides a summary of the study's findings and offers some critique and suggestions for improvement.
Claim: Breast-Feeding Linked to Reduced Risk of Preemie Eye Problem
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This article consists overall of balanced reporting. There are a few missteps in presenting the quantitative evidence but some very strong points are present as well, including the acknowledgement that the studies under consideration are all observational in nature, and the corresponding reminder that “correlation does not imply causation.”   Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding eye disorder. The article reports on a meta-analysis examining whether human breast milk, compared with formula, is associated with protection against developing ROP.",Breast-Feeding Linked to Reduced Risk of Preemie Eye Problem,"This story reports on a study that found an association between breast-feeding and a reduced risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a condition that can lead to vision impairment or blindness in premature infants.

The story also could have been more clear about the fact that the study did not compare the costs of breast milk and formula, as both feeding methods entail costs that are beyond the scope of the coverage. The story also could have been more clear about the fact that the greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries."
210,"### Context: The article discusses a study that found that small increases in physical activity can reduce the risks of immobility and disability in older adults. The study involved a twice-weekly supervised exercise program and compared the results to a health education group. The release notes that changes in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group compared to the health education group. However, the release does not provide specific details on the improvements in mobility or the exact risk factors that were reduced.

The article also mentions that there may be modest costs associated with participating in the exercise program, such as purchasing walking shoes or ankle weights. However, it emphasizes that walking at a modest pace and performing stretches and balance exercises can be done at home or in public spaces at little to no cost.

The release acknowledges some limitations of the study, including the exclusion of a large number of participants during the screening process, which may affect the generalizability of the study's conclusions. It also notes that harm scores were similar among all study participants, indicating that the exercise program was designed to be safe for older, sedentary individuals.

The article suggests that the release could have provided more information about the study group and the control group to add context and clarity. It also mentions that the release does not mention any alternatives to walking as a physical exercise, such as resistance training or cardiovascular endurance training, which have also been shown to benefit older adults.

Overall, the article highlights the positive findings of the study regarding the benefits of small increases in physical activity for older adults. However, it also points out areas where the release could have provided more information and context.
Claim: Small increases in physical activity reduce immobility, disability risks in older adults
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This university news release describes results of a study of sedentary elderly Americans enrolled in a federally funded study designed to document and improve their physical mobility and function. The release does a good job of describing the study methods and the conclusion that a modest increase of at least 48 minutes a week of moderately intense walking and walking-based strengthening exercises achieved significant, if not dramatic, decreases in average overall risk of major mobility disability over a two-year-plus period of time. It also paid appropriate attention to the “dose-dependent” benefits of the exercise regimen as compared to the control group’s health education classes. That is, the greater the increase in minutes of exercise, the greater the benefits on average overall. It also noted the researchers’ conclusion that although 150 minutes of exercise a week was the goal, seeing benefits at just 48 minutes does have implications for exercise compliance rates and the likelihood that even elderly couch potatoes might devote 15 minutes or so a few days a week to stay healthier. The release didn’t include any numbers summarizing and putting the results in context. It also would have been strengthened by including a more detailed description of what “sedentary” referred to. One notable inclusion was a paragraph devoted to weaknesses in the study. Bravo for that. As the U.S. population ages, increasing numbers of elderly signal their desire to live independently, and evidence for the benefits of consistent and persistent exercise grows, researchers, geriatricians and the public are clearly interested in identifying optimal and safe exercise regimens that people can do on their own, that don’t require gym memberships or expensive equipment, and that — most of all– that people will stick to over the long haul. For many over 70 or 75 years of age, even half an hour a day can seem overwhelming. Thus, research suggesting that 20 minutes a day of moderately intense walking (with or without ankle weights), stretching, and balance exercises is a reasonable goal. Studies designed to demonstrate with some confidence that even moderate exercise can contribute to reduced risk of disability are likely to attract interest among caregivers and the public.","Small increases in physical activity reduce immobility, disability risks in older adults","This news release describes a randomized controlled trial of a twice-weekly, supervised exercise program for older adults who are sedentary.

211,"### Context: The claim that the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed being single as a disability under their definition of infertility is not accurate. The UK newspaper The Telegraph reported in October 2016 that the WHO had revised their definition of infertility to include single men and women. The article stated that under the new terms, single men and women without medical issues who want to become parents would be classified as ""infertile"" and given the same priority as couples seeking IVF due to medical fertility problems. The article quoted endocrinologist David Adamson, who was listed as an author of the new WHO standards, as saying that the revised definition gave every individual ""the right to reproduce"" and set an international legal standard.

However, the WHO denied the Telegraph's reporting in a statement. They clarified that their definition of infertility, as stated in their Glossary of definitions for infertility and fertility care, remained the same. The clinical definition of infertility is ""a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse."" The WHO stated that they were considering revising the definition of infertility but emphasized that any changes would still be a clinical description of infertility as a disease of the reproductive system and would not make recommendations about the provision of fertility care services.

It is important to note that the WHO's website did not reflect any changes to their terminology concerning infertility, and the organization's definitions are contained in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The article did not include any material or comments from the WHO itself but quoted an endocrinologist who was listed as an author of the new standards. The WHO's denial of the Telegraph's reporting suggests that the claim that being single is listed as a disability under their definition of infertility is not accurate.

212,"### Context: The article examines an ad produced by Crossroads GPS, a conservative advocacy group, attacking Rep. Joe Sestak, who is running for a Senate seat against former GOP Rep. Pat Toomey. The ad claims that Sestak ""voted to gut Medicare, slashing benefits for Pennsylvania seniors"" and ""voted to cut Medicare by $500 billion."" The article fact-checks these claims and provides context.

The ad references a statistic from the Kaiser Family Foundation, stating that Sestak's vote would reduce benefits for 854,489 seniors. The article confirms that this number is accurate and represents the number of Pennsylvania seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage, which is an option within Medicare provided by private insurers.

The article explains that the Medicare Advantage program was targeted by the new health care law due to its higher costs. The law phased out extra payments to Medicare Advantage programs, aiming to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and save $136 billion. This could result in cuts to the more generous benefits offered by Medicare Advantage plans, such as dental and vision coverage.

However, the article clarifies that the new law does not cut basic Medicare benefits, only the extra benefits not available to those with traditional Medicare. It also highlights that other parts of the law expand coverage for seniors and make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients.

The article concludes that while there may be cuts to Medicare Advantage, suggesting that these changes will ""gut"" Medicare or jeopardize access to care for millions is an exaggeration. It acknowledges that there is a risk some Medicare Advantage providers may pull out of the market, but Medicare beneficiaries have multiple plans available to them, and they can always sign up for regular Medicare.

Regarding the claim that Sestak ""voted to cut Medicare by $500 billion,"" the article explains that the new law slows the rate of growth of the broader Medicare program over ten years. It does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. While these reductions could squeeze future benefits, the article argues that the use of the word ""gut"" and the notion of jeopardizing access to care for millions is an exaggeration.

In summary, the article fact-checks the claims made in the ad and concludes that while there may be cuts to Medicare Advantage, the ad's language is exaggerated, and the changes are not likely to ""gut"" Medicare or jeopardize access to care for millions.

214,"### Context: In a transcript from February 24, 2020, radio personality Rush Limbaugh claimed that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is no more dangerous than the common cold and that concerns over the virus were part of an effort to make President Donald Trump look bad. Limbaugh suggested that the death of a 34-year-old doctor who discovered and succumbed to the virus, Li Wenliang, was the cause of global concern. He also alleged that the virus was being weaponized by China and that the media was exaggerating its dangers to scare investors and harm Trump.

Limbaugh's claim that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the common cold is inaccurate. The common cold is typically caused by rhinoviruses, while COVID-19 is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to be around 2.3 percent, according to a study published in JAMA. This is significantly higher than the mortality rate of the common cold, which is known to cause no mortality or serious morbidity.

Limbaugh's claim that concerns over COVID-19 were exaggerated to make Trump look bad also does not hold water. The global concern over the virus was not limited to the United States and was based on the emerging evidence of its severity. World health officials attended to concerns about and research into COVID-19, and it was not solely driven by political motives.

While Limbaugh's claim that the virus was being weaponized by China is unsupported by evidence, it is true that COVID-19 is a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China. Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have caused significant morbidity and mortality. The ultimate scope and effects of the COVID-19 outbreak were still uncertain at the time of Limbaugh's comments.

In summary, Limbaugh's claim that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the common cold is inaccurate. COVID-19 is a novel strain of coronavirus with a higher mortality rate than the common cold. Concerns over the virus were not solely driven by political motives and were based on emerging evidence of its severity. While Limbaugh's claim that the virus was being weaponized by China is unsupported, it is true that COVID-19 is a novel strain of coronavirus that emerged in China.

215,"### Context: So far in the current season that began in the fall and will last into spring, 90 people in the state have been hospitalized with the flu and 1,287 people have tested positive, health officials said. The number is likely an underrepresentation of the number of people who have been infected, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The best way to avoid the flu is to get vaccinated and take other precautions to stay healthy, officials said. “Influenza is unpredictable and, in some cases, deadly,” said Maine CDC director Dr. Nirav D. Shah. “The most effective way to prevent the spread of influenza is to get vaccinated, and it’s not too late to get a flu shot.” In addition to getting vaccinated, health officials suggest a number of other steps to avoid getting sick including washing your hands, covering a cough and staying home when sick.

The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Cases of influenza have been found in all 16 Maine counties and the disease is now considered widespread, state health officials said Wednesday.",Influenza now in all Maine counties; considered widespread.,The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention says influenza has been reported in all 16 Maine counties and the flu is now considered widespread in the state.
216,"### Context: The article discusses the folk remedy of ingesting gin-soaked raisins as a treatment for arthritis. It mentions that arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes pain and loss of mobility, and while drug therapies are available, they don't work equally well for everyone and there is no cure for the disease. As a result, many people have turned to folk medicine for relief, including remedies like cider vinegar, honey, copper or magnetic bracelets, and gin-soaked raisins.

According to the lore of folk medicine, the raisins used must be of the golden variety, and the number of gin-marinated raisins to be consumed daily varies. The duration of the soak also varies. The article mentions various explanations for why gin-soaked raisins are believed to work, including the anti-inflammatory properties of juniper berries and the presence of compounds like proanthocyanidins and resveratrol in grapes.

However, the article points out that the amount of juniper berry essence in gin is minuscule, and there is no support for claims about its anti-inflammatory properties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture states that proanthocyanidins in raisins are undetectable, and raisins are a poor source of resveratrol. The article also mentions that medical experts see little potential for harm in the gin-soaked raisin regimen.

The practice of ingesting gin-soaked raisins has been around for several decades, with sightings of it dating back to at least 1981. It gained more attention after radio personality and columnist Paul Harvey mentioned it in 1994 and received positive feedback from his audience. The article includes a humorous letter from someone who tried both variations of the remedy and experienced pain relief.

In summary, the article discusses the folk remedy of ingesting gin-soaked raisins for arthritis relief. It mentions the lack of scientific evidence supporting the remedy's effectiveness and highlights the varying explanations given for why it might work. The article also notes that medical experts see little potential for harm in this regimen.

217,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that preventive care does not save the government money. Columnist David Brooks argues that while preventive care is good for health, it does not save money. He refers to studies from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that indicate expanded utilization of preventive services leads to higher overall medical spending. The CBO director, Douglas Elmendorf, explains that to avert one case of acute illness, preventive care needs to be provided to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. Elmendorf also mentions that a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving.

The CBO did not provide a specific price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in the House bills due to budgeting rules. However, other studies support the CBO's analysis. A 2008 article in the New England Journal of Medicine states that sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention are overreaching and that preventing illness can sometimes add to healthcare costs. Additionally, a study conducted by the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, and the American Cancer Society concludes that current prevention activities for cardiovascular disease would substantially increase costs.

In summary, while preventive care is beneficial for health and can save lives, it is unlikely to save government spending on healthcare. The argument is supported by studies and the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office.

218,"### Context: The article titled ""New hope for macular degeneration"" discusses the recent approval of the drug Lucentis by the FDA for the treatment of neovascular, or ""wet"", age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The drug is said to cost around $2000 a month, but the article does not provide any context by comparing this cost to other treatments for AMD. The article mentions that Lucentis has shown benefits in clinical trials, but only provides estimates of benefit for the drug group and not the control group. The article also mentions potential side effects of the drug, such as inflammation, infection, and detached retina.

The article mentions that there have been two studies on Lucentis, but does not provide enough information on the strength of the available evidence. Specifically, there have been no studies comparing the effectiveness of Lucentis to Avastin, another drug commonly used off-label to treat AMD. The article quotes one expert, but does not include quotes from other researchers or clinicians who could provide more context.

The article does not mention any existing treatments for AMD, such as Avastin or laser therapy, although it does list preventive strategies such as smoking cessation and treatment of hypertension. It does, however, accurately describe the prevalence and seriousness of AMD, avoiding disease mongering. The article could have been clearer about the difference between the ""wet"" and ""dry"" forms of the disease.

The article states that Lucentis is a new drug, but fails to mention that a very similar drug, Avastin, has been used in the same manner for a few years. It also does not clarify if the information in the article is solely based on a press release.

In summary, the article discusses the recent approval of Lucentis for the treatment of neovascular AMD. It mentions the cost of the drug, potential benefits and side effects, and the lack of comparative studies with other drugs. However, it lacks context, quotes from other experts, and information on existing treatments for AMD. It also fails to clarify the difference between the ""wet"" and ""dry"" forms of the disease and does not mention if the information is solely based on a press release.
Claim: New hope for macular degeneration
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common and potentially devastating eye disorder. There are two major types of AMD, “dry” and “wet”. “Dry” AMD is by far the more common type, but it progresses very slowly. “Wet” or neovascular AMD, is less common, but the onset is very sudden and can progress quickly to blindness. The recent FDA approval of the drug Lucentis and the publication of two studies on Lucentis in this week’s New England Journal of Medicine bring new information to patients with neovascular AMD. While the clinical trial results are promising, the extremely high cost of the drug (around $2000 a month) may be unaffordable for many patients and could place a great strain on Medicare, which would cover 80% of the cost. Furthermore, there are currently no studies showing how Lucentis compares to a very similar drug, Avastin, which is not approved for used in AMD, but is frequently used off-label for the condition and which costs much less. This story does a decent job of describing the new developments, but missed an opportunity to explain the controversy surrounding the use of Avastin. The story clearly states that Lucentis was recently approved by the FDA. The story should have been more clear that the approval was for neovascular, or “wet”, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and not the more common “dry” form of AMD. The story does states that the cost of the drug is about $2000 a month. However, the story should have provided more context by comparing this cost to the cost of other treatments for AMD. The story could have been more clear about the difference between the “wet” and “dry” forms of the disease. Although the story mentions two studies, this is not enough information on the strength of the available evidence. Specifically, there have been no studies comparing the effectiveness of Lucentis to Avastin. The story provides estimates of benefit for the drug group only. The story should have given the estimates of benefit for both the drug group and the control group. Furthermore, the story only quotes one expert. The story should have quoted other researchers or clinicians who could provide more context.",New hope for macular degeneration,"This is a story about a new drug, Lucentis, which was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of """"wet"""" age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

219,"### Context: The article discusses a photograph that went viral on Facebook in February 2019, showing an eagle catching a drone. The caption of the photo claimed it to be the ""Picture of the Century"" and portrayed nature defeating technology. The article confirms that the photograph is genuine and was taken by photographer Koen Van Weel in March 2016 during a police exercise in the Netherlands. The image is available on Getty Images with a caption explaining that the eagle is from the company ""Guard from Above"" and can catch drones from the air using its talons.

The article also mentions a 2016 video report from BBC News that showcased eagles and other birds of prey being used to bring down drones. The authorities are exploring ways to safely bring down drones due to concerns about near-misses with aircraft, invasions of privacy, and security breaches.

However, some groups argue against using birds of prey for this purpose, citing the danger it poses to the animals. The article includes an excerpt from a National Geographic article that highlights the potential harm to eagles if they misjudge their attack or if the drone operator takes evasive maneuvers. It questions the number of eagles that should be put at risk and mentions the historical decline of bald eagles due to factors like pesticides, habitat destruction, and illegal shooting.

The company ""Guard from Above"" acknowledges the importance of animal welfare and states that they are studying the possible impact on the birds' claws.

In summary, the article confirms the authenticity of the photograph showing an eagle catching a drone. It mentions the use of birds of prey to bring down drones and the concerns raised about the potential harm to the animals involved.

220,"### Context: Bayer shares fell over 12% after a jury in San Francisco federal court found that Roundup, a weed killer produced by Monsanto (acquired by Bayer last year), was a ""substantial factor"" in causing a California resident's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The judge in the case had split the trial at Bayer's request, limiting evidence plaintiffs could present in the first phase. This defeat sets up the second phase to be even tougher for Bayer and limits the grounds on which the company could appeal any final verdict. Bayer denies that Roundup causes cancer and stands behind the safety of the product. The second trial phase, which began on Wednesday, will determine liability. Bayer faces over 11,200 lawsuits related to Roundup. Last August, a California state court jury issued a $289 million verdict against the company, which was later reduced to $78 million and is being appealed. Bayer's new legal strategy was focused on keeping out plaintiffs' allegations that the company improperly influenced scientists, regulators, and the public about the safety of Roundup. However, now that Bayer has lost the first phase, almost all of the previously excluded evidence can be presented to the jury. Plaintiffs' lawyers have accused Monsanto of influencing the science around Roundup through its relationship with regulators. Experts believe it is unlikely that Bayer will be able to convince the jury in the second phase that the company is not liable. Bayer could argue on appeal that plaintiffs' experts and their scientific evidence were insufficient and statistically invalid, but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is generally permissive in allowing expert testimony. Some lawyers believe it is too soon to write off Bayer's legal strategy, as future Roundup cases could result in different outcomes.
Claim: Jury finding upends Bayer's Roundup defense strategy: experts.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:

221,"### Context: In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Senator Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being a ""Democrat-lite"" candidate who agrees with Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton on many issues, including taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. Cruz argued that Trump cannot criticize Clinton's policies because he supports them. Cruz has been a vocal supporter of defunding Planned Parenthood since an anti-abortion group released secretly filmed footage purporting to show the organization selling fetal tissue for profit, although courts have not found evidence of criminal wrongdoing.

Regarding Clinton's position, she has consistently supported Planned Parenthood throughout her campaign and has attacked Republicans' pledge to defund the organization. Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in July, marking its first-ever presidential primary endorsement. Clinton has stated that she not only opposes defunding Planned Parenthood but also believes the organization should receive more funding.

Trump's position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood is more nuanced. While he has changed his stance on abortion multiple times, he has been fairly consistent since October 2015 regarding funding for Planned Parenthood. Trump believes that Congress should stop providing federal funding to the organization as long as they provide abortions. He has made various statements on the subject, including expressing support for defunding Planned Parenthood and stating that the organization should not receive tax dollars as long as they perform abortions. However, Trump has also acknowledged that Planned Parenthood does some positive work in areas like cancer prevention.

In summary, Cruz's claim that both Trump and Clinton say Planned Parenthood is ""terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding"" is partially true. While both candidates acknowledge the positive work done by Planned Parenthood, Clinton supports their abortion services and believes they should receive more funding, while Trump believes they should not receive taxpayer dollars as long as they provide abortions.

222,"### Context: The article discusses the investigation into the illegal spiking of CBD vapes and focuses on a specific vape called Yolo! that caused over 50 people in Salt Lake City to be poisoned. The vape contained synthetic marijuana instead of CBD, resulting in intense highs, hallucinations, and seizures. The article traces the origins of Yolo to a Southern California beach town and an entrepreneur named Janell Thompson. Thompson, along with her business partner, founded an e-cigarette company called Hookahzz, which was among the first to sell vapes that delivered CBD. They later formed another company called Mathco Health Corporation.

Yolo, spiked with synthetic marijuana, started appearing on store shelves in Salt Lake City in 2017. Authorities believed that some people sought out Yolo to get high, while others unknowingly ingested a dangerous drug. The source of Yolo remained unknown until a former Mathco bookkeeper, Tatianna Gustafson, collected evidence and filed a workplace retaliation complaint. Gustafson discovered that Yolo was the main culprit in the Utah poisonings and reported her findings to the Utah Poison Control Center.

The article also mentions that Yolo was sold in at least six other states, including North Carolina, where vapes labeled as Black Magic and Black Diamond had sickened over 40 people. Investigators were able to connect Thompson to this outbreak based on a guilty plea from the distributor of the spiked vapes.

Thompson was eventually linked to dealers charged in New York, where she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute synthetic marijuana and a money laundering charge. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman referred to Thompson as a ""drug trafficker"" who used JK Wholesale, a company she was involved with, to distribute synthetic marijuana. Thompson faces up to 40 years in prison.

Thompson's former business partner and roommate, Katarina Maloney, distanced herself from Yolo during an interview and stated that Yolo in Utah was not purchased from their company. Maloney asserted that their products are compliant with all laws and undergo lab testing.

In conclusion, the article highlights the investigation into the illegal spiking of CBD vapes, specifically focusing on the Yolo vape that caused numerous illnesses in Salt Lake City. The article traces the origins of Yolo to Janell Thompson and her involvement with various companies. Thompson has pleaded guilty to charges related to the distribution of synthetic marijuana.

The quote was part of an article titled ""A Nation's Future Foretold"" which featured various commentators describing their thoughts on what the world would be like in 2020. The quote was taken out of context and falsely attributed to Gates.

However, there is another genuine quote from Gates in the same issue of George magazine. He is quoted as talking about ""funding population control."" This quote has been shared by conspiracy theorists who believe Gates is using the COVID-19 pandemic to microchip the population through vaccines.

225,"### Context: During the COVID-19 pandemic, truck drivers have been providing an essential service by delivering food and supplies. However, there have been complaints about some fast-food chains turning them away. Many restaurants have switched to a drive-thru model in response to the epidemic, but truckers have reported being refused service when they attempt to walk up and order at these drive-thru windows.

Fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Wendy's, KFC, and Taco Bell have recently announced the closure of their dining rooms and are focusing on delivery and drive-thru orders. Truckers have expressed difficulty maneuvering their rigs through drive-thru lanes, leaving them with no option but to walk up to the windows.

Trucking news website Transportation Nation reported that a trucking group reached out to McDonald's on March 18, requesting changes to allow easier access to food for truckers. McDonald's responded by creating a curbside ordering system, instructing truckers to use their mobile order and pay app and then walk to the designated curbside sign outside the restaurant. An employee would bring the order out when it's ready.

Similar incidents have been reported at Wendy's and Burger King, but only Wendy's responded to inquiries. They expressed appreciation for truck drivers and stated that they are exploring options to make their food available to as many customers as possible while prioritizing safety and security.

The social media posts claiming that truck drivers are being turned away from fast-food restaurants due to closed dining rooms and the inability to fit their rigs in drive-thru lanes are accurate. McDonald's has responded with a curbside ordering app at some locations, and Wendy's is exploring options.

In conclusion, truck drivers are indeed facing difficulties accessing food at fast-food restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some chains have implemented curbside ordering systems to accommodate truckers, but more updated information is needed to fully assess the situation.

226,"### Context: The claim that possums kill up to 4,000 ticks a week and help stop the spread of Lyme disease is mostly true, but the number of ticks they kill has been exaggerated. The claim originated from an ""Awesome Possum"" meme that went viral on social media. However, there is scientific evidence to support the claim that possums play a role in preventing the spread of Lyme disease.

Richard Ostfeld, a forest ecologist and expert on infectious diseases, conducted research at the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. The study aimed to understand the role of different mammals in the spread of ticks and Lyme disease. They tested six species, including possums, by exposing them to 100 ticks. The researchers found that possums were remarkably efficient at getting rid of ticks compared to other species.

Possums groom themselves like cats and if they find a tick, they lick it off and swallow it. The research team analyzed possum droppings to confirm this behavior. Based on their findings, the team estimated that in one season, a possum could kill about 5,000 ticks. Therefore, the claim that possums kill up to 4,000 ticks a week is not entirely accurate, but they do play a significant role in tick control.

The idea that possums help stop the spread of Lyme disease is based on the cause-and-effect theory that possums kill ticks, which carry the disease. While the exact number of ticks killed by possums may be lower than claimed, their contribution to tick control is still valuable in reducing the risk of Lyme disease transmission.

In conclusion, the claim that possums kill up to 4,000 ticks a week and help stop the spread of Lyme disease is mostly true. Scientific research supports the idea that possums are efficient at removing ticks, although the actual number of ticks they kill may be closer to 5,000 in a season rather than 4,000 in a week. Nonetheless, possums play an important role in tick control and reducing the risk of Lyme disease transmission.

In 2007, PepsiCo Inc. made a decision to amend the label on bottles of Aquafina to clarify that the water came from a ""public water source."" This was in response to growing opposition to the bottled water industry. The label change included the words ""Public Water Source."" However, it is important to note that the water used in Aquafina products goes through various filtration and purification processes before it is bottled. The Aquafina website explains that the water originates from public water sources and is then purified through processes such as reverse osmosis and other filtering methods to remove substances that can affect taste. Every bottle of Aquafina is produced at a water purification center. It is also common for bottled water companies to use public water sources. For example, Dasani, produced by the Coca-Cola Company, also uses public water sources and undergoes a filtration process. A 2015 article from Mother Jones reported that 45% of bottled water in the United States comes from the municipal water supply, while the other 55% is spring water.

229,"### Context: The claim made by Gordon Quan, the Democratic nominee for Harris County judge, that 70 percent of all males over 50 have some form of heart disease is not confirmed by the available statistics. Quan stated in an email that he saw this statistic on the Preventive Medicine Research Institute's website, but the statement could not be found on the institute's site. The Texas Heart Institute provided statistics from the American Heart Association's 2010 update, which showed that nearly 40 percent of men and women aged 40 to 59 have some kind of cardiovascular disease, while 74 percent of men and 73 percent of women aged 60 to 79 fit into that category. However, these statistics did not specifically address men between the ages of 50 and 60. The director of public affairs at the Texas Heart Institute stated that the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in men aged 50 and over is somewhere between 40 percent and 70 percent, with the percentage rising above 70 percent by the time they reach age 60. The director of communications for the South Central Affiliate of the American Heart Association also confirmed that men over 50 are at risk of developing heart disease, with more than 71 percent of men over age 20 being considered overweight or obese, a major risk factor. Information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed that the prevalence of heart disease among U.S. men 50 and older was about 19 percent if the definition of coronary heart disease was limited to people with heart attacks, angina, and heart failure. However, under a broader definition that includes stroke and hypertension, 61 percent of males 50 and older were diagnosed with heart-related difficulties. It is important to note that these estimates do not include men with undiagnosed heart disease, so the prevalence of heart disease among males 50 and older is likely higher. Overall, while the statistics do not confirm Quan's statement, they do show that a significant percentage of men over 50 have some form of heart disease.

230,"### Context: The article discusses social media rumors that claim Tidy Cats Lightweight cat litter is causing breathing problems in cats. The rumors include anecdotes from pet owners who believe that the litter caused their cats to become sick or even die. Some of the top-rated reviews on Amazon mention instances of cats getting sick from the litter, but it is unclear where this information originated from. There are also claims that Purina, the company that produces Tidy Cats, is compensating pet owners who complain about the litter. However, there is no concrete evidence to support these claims.

In response to the rumors, the @TidyCats Twitter account stated that all their products are completely safe. A Purina representative also responded to an inquiry about the rumor, stating that Tidy Cats Lightweight litter is safe for cats. They mentioned that negative posts on social media are often anonymous, based on hearsay, or contain unsupported information.

The article concludes by stating that nearly half of all cat-owning households use Tidy Cats, and that consumer concerns are not uncommon with a product used by such a large number of households. The company encourages consumers to consult with their veterinarian if they have any concerns about their pet's experience with the litter.

Overall, the article highlights the social media rumors surrounding Tidy Cats Lightweight cat litter and the lack of concrete evidence to support these claims. The company maintains that their product is safe for cats and encourages consumers to consult with their veterinarian if they have any concerns.

231,"### Context: The article discusses the accuracy of claims made about former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, particularly in relation to the film ""American Sniper."" It states that while Kyle is the most decorated sniper in American military history, some events of his life have been embellished and exaggerated. The article addresses several specific claims about Kyle:

1. Claims about the historical accuracy of ""American Sniper"": The article quotes Clint Eastwood, the film's director, who states that the movie portrays Kyle's perspective of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not an objective, historically accurate account.

2. Chris Kyle killing looters during Hurricane Katrina: The claim that Kyle killed 30 looters in New Orleans is false. The rumor originated from a story Kyle reportedly told to a private group of Navy SEALs, but there is no evidence to support it.

3. Chris Kyle killing two carjackers in Texas: The claim that Kyle killed two carjackers is also false. The account first appeared in a magazine article, but there is no confirmation of its veracity. Sheriffs from the relevant counties where the incident supposedly occurred deny any knowledge of it.

4. Chris Kyle knocking out Jesse Ventura: This claim is false and led to a defamation lawsuit against Kyle. Kyle mentioned in his memoir that he punched an unnamed celebrity, but Ventura successfully sued Kyle for defamation, arguing that the fabricated fight generated publicity for Kyle's book.

5. Most of the proceeds from ""American Sniper"" were not donated to veterans: While the publisher initially stated that Kyle had donated the book's proceeds to the families of fallen friends, Kyle's widow testified in court that they were unable to donate as much as they had planned due to gift tax laws. The National Review estimates that only a small portion of the royalties went to veterans' families.

In summary, the article debunks several claims made about Chris Kyle, highlighting the lack of evidence or conflicting accounts. It emphasizes the need for skepticism when it comes to legendary figures and the tendency for stories to be embellished or exaggerated.

233,"### Context: The claim states that prospective gang members are being initiated by killing drivers who flash their headlights at them. This claim is part of a long-standing urban legend that has been circulating since the early 1980s. The legend has evolved over time, with different versions mentioning different gangs and locations.

The article provides multiple examples of the legend being spread through emails and text messages, warning people not to flash their headlights at cars without headlights on. The warnings claim that this is a gang initiation game, and the new gang member is required to chase and shoot at the car that flashes their headlights.

The article also mentions that the legend has caused panic and hysteria in various communities, leading to increased police presence and warnings from law enforcement agencies. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that this initiation ritual is actually happening.

The article highlights that the legend has been circulating for over 30 years and has been debunked multiple times. It mentions incidents that may have contributed to the spread of the legend, such as a real-life incident in 1992 where a woman was shot after a gesture was mistaken as a sign of disrespect.

The article concludes by stating that the legend has been the subject of movies, such as the 1998 film ""Urban Legend,"" and that there have been occasional incidents that resemble the legend but are not directly related to it.

Overall, the article provides information about the long-standing urban legend of gang initiation through flashing headlights and emphasizes that there is no evidence to support the claim.

234,"### Context: Chronic fatigue syndrome, officially known as ME/CFS, is a debilitating condition characterized by profound fatigue that lasts for more than six months and is worsened by exertion. It affects up to 2.5 million Americans and is often misdiagnosed or dismissed by doctors. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown, and there are no approved treatments or diagnostic tests. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has increased funding for research on ME/CFS and is conducting a unique study to unravel its biology.

The NIH study focuses on patients who developed ME/CFS after an infection within the past five years. The goal is to capture the disease at its early stages and understand the body's abnormal reactions to illness. Previous studies have found brain inflammation, nervous system abnormalities, and immune system dysfunction in ME/CFS patients. Researchers are also investigating the energy drain experienced by patients.

Volunteers in the study undergo a week-long hospitalization for various tests, including blood and genetic tests, brain scans, spinal taps, sleep tests, and gut bacteria analysis. They also participate in exercise tests to measure how their muscles use oxygen and track their energy usage. The study aims to identify potential targets for future treatments.

While the study does not offer immediate treatments, participants like Ault, a patient with ME/CFS, have found value in learning about the disease and strategies to conserve energy. Ault's symptoms began after a routine infection, and his condition has significantly impacted his daily life.

ME/CFS remains a mystery, and the NIH study aims to shed light on its underlying biology. The hope is that this research will lead to effective treatments for ME/CFS patients who currently have limited options. Until then, patients like Ault continue to live with uncertainty and hope for the best while managing their symptoms.

235,"### Context: The claim that Obamacare provides insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally, is false. The email that makes this claim is referring to a 2009 health care proposal that never became law. The Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in 2010, does not provide health insurance to anyone living in the United States illegally. The law contains an individual mandate that requires U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase health insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits. However, people who are here illegally are not required to follow the mandate because they should not be in the country. They are also ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage and cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges or receive tax credits to offset the cost of coverage. Certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, but this policy predates the Affordable Care Act. Legal non-U.S. citizens who are in the country legally are subject to the mandate and are eligible to shop on the exchanges. The law includes a special rule that allows certain poor, legal noncitizens to get tax credits to purchase health insurance on an exchange if they do not qualify for Medicaid and earn at or below the poverty line. However, about 1 million of Florida's poorest citizens are not eligible to receive tax credits for the exchanges and Florida leaders did not expand Medicaid coverage to include them. The claim made in the email is false and the Affordable Care Act does not provide insurance to non-U.S. residents, especially those who are here illegally.

236,"### Context: Following the eruption of Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island in Indonesia, a large landslide occurred on the volcano's slope and underwater. This displacement of water resulted in a tsunami that hit communities along the Sunda Strait on Saturday night. The Indonesian Meteorology, Geophysics and Climatology Agency has warned people to stay at least 500 meters from the coastline along the strait, as further eruptions and stormy weather could potentially trigger more landslides and tsunamis. The warning was reiterated by the country's disaster agency. The tsunami struck without warning, surprising people who were enjoying holiday activities. This event, along with a previous earthquake and tsunami in September, triggered flashbacks for survivors of the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed over 230,000 people. Some victims of the recent tsunami expressed hope in rebuilding their lives, inspired by the resilience of the Acehnese people who survived the 2004 disaster. The country's system of tsunami detection buoys, deployed after the 2004 disaster, has not been functioning since 2012. The tsunami was caused by volcanic activity, which would not have been detected by the system's seafloor sensors. The volcanic activity is believed to have triggered an underwater landslide, causing a large volume of water to displace and create the waves that hit the shore. The tsunami caused significant damage to the affected areas, with houses ripped from their foundations and concrete buildings destroyed. The death toll currently stands at 430, with over 1,400 people injured and at least 159 missing. More than 21,000 people have been displaced from their homes, and urgent aid and heavy equipment are needed to reach those who may be injured or trapped. Anak Krakatau formed near the site of the catastrophic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which killed over 30,000 people. The volcano has been erupting since June and erupted again 24 minutes before the tsunami.

The story reports that half of women diagnosed with cervical cancer have never had a Pap test, and another 10 percent hadn’t had one in five years. So it at least indirectly addressed benefit. The story reports that many cervical abnormalities discovered by screening ""usually go away on their own, and unnecessary treatment increases girls’ risk of premature labor years later."" The story does not describe the evidence upon which the guideline revisions are based. Its says only that ACOG ""cited studies."" The story does nothing to exaggerate the prevalence or severity of cervical cancer. The story essentially cites no sources other than the guidelines themselves. An expert voice or two would have been useful to help people understand the meaning of the guidelines. The story clearly compares the revised screening guidelines with the most recent ones. It also cites the link between women not being screened and getting cervical cancer. The availability of Pap smear tests is not in question in this story.

238,"### Context: The claim states that Rudy Giuliani tweeted to criticize the Obama administration for allegedly giving a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab in China in 2017, where the COVID-19 coronavirus supposedly originated. The article confirms that Giuliani did tweet this statement. However, it points out that Giuliani's reference to 2017 was not necessarily a mistake, as government funding is typically proposed and approved long before it is disbursed. 

The article clarifies that the $3.7 million grant was not solely given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but rather a series of grants for coronavirus research issued by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to different entities. The EcoHealth Alliance, based in New York, received these grants between 2014 and 2019 to study the risk of future coronavirus emergence from wildlife in China. Only a portion of this money was used for research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and approximately $700,000 of the grant was awarded under the Trump administration.

The article emphasizes that the research involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology was an international collaboration with the EcoHealth Alliance, and the funds were originally appropriated by the NIAID in 2014 during the Obama administration. However, the most recent payment in 2019 was authorized by the Trump administration.

In summary, Rudy Giuliani's tweet criticizing the Obama administration for giving a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab in 2017 is partially accurate. While the grant was not solely given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a portion of it was used for research at that institution. Additionally, the funds were originally appropriated during the Obama administration, but the most recent payment was authorized by the Trump administration.

239,"### Context: Volkswagen (VW) is preparing two Chinese factories to produce electric cars next year, with a combined production capacity of 600,000 vehicles. This move reveals VW's ability to industrialize production faster than other pioneers in the electric vehicle market, such as Tesla. While Tesla is still working on its goal of producing over 500,000 cars a year by building a new factory in Shanghai, VW can rely on its existing workforce in two plants in Anting and Foshun to build zero-emission cars. VW is leveraging its large infrastructure of suppliers, factories, and workers to scale up faster than other manufacturers. The company is making a significant bet on a dedicated electric vehicle architecture called MEB, with the aim of reducing the price of electric cars to around €20,000 ($22,262). VW plans to retool eight plants globally by 2022 to specialize in manufacturing electric cars and license its MEB platform to rivals. The company aims to become the world's largest maker of zero-emission vehicles, with a target of building 22 million electric cars by 2028. In contrast, Tesla is likely to remain a niche player. VW's ID.3 electric vehicle, which starts production this year, has a lower price compared to Tesla's Model 3, thanks to VW's ability to place large orders and drive down the price. VW is investing €50 billion ($55.5 billion) to buy battery cells and will license its MEB platform to other carmakers. However, the availability of skilled workforce and supply chain bottlenecks may pose challenges to VW's plans. In the short term, VW and its Chinese joint venture partners will invest €15 billion to produce 15 different electric cars for China alone by 2025. VW's expansion push comes at a time when investors are questioning businesses that deliver growth without real profit, which is affecting the ability of electric car pioneers like Tesla to raise more cash.

240,"### Context: The article discusses a press release about a study that compared two drugs and a placebo for the treatment of osteoporosis in women. The release does not mention the cost of the existing FDA-approved comparator drug, which is a notable omission. However, it quantifies the benefits of the drugs being studied and the placebo in both relative and absolute terms, showing that a small group of people saw benefits compared to the larger group of women who were studied. The release presents most of the data as absolute risk, which is excellent as it shows the benefit and the fact that most patients did not have a fracture regardless of the treatment given.

The release mentions that there were no significant differences in harms between the drugs and the placebo, but it does not describe all the side effects. However, it does mention that hypercalcemia was lower with the new agent compared to the existing comparator drug. Although this was not explained in depth, the release is given the benefit of the doubt for briefly mentioning harms.

The release provides a clear explanation of how the study was conducted, the number of participants, and other important details. It does not engage in disease mongering and quotes two people not associated with the study from an accompanying editorial. However, it does not make it clear whether Radius Health, the funder of the study, is involved in making an osteoporosis drug. The release directs readers to the full study for information on financial disclosures, which reveals that the corresponding author of the release has ties to Radius Health and other pharmaceutical companies.

The article points out that the release does not explain other ways the condition is treated, which is important information. It also does not clarify whether the drugs being studied are already on the market. The release does not make the novelty of the findings clear, as it does not explain why a new medicine is needed when there is already an existing one available.

Overall, the release provides some important information about the study but lacks details on costs, side effects, financial disclosures, and the novelty of the findings. It also fails to explain alternative treatments and whether the drugs being studied are already on the market.
Claim: Injected Drug Reduces Risk of Fracture among Women with Osteoporosis
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"There’s so much to like about this news release. In particular, it does a wonderful and economical job summarizing the benefits of the drugs being studied. It provides the numbers in both absolute and relative terms, for example. But it skimps on some of the details, chiefly the costs of the drugs, that the funder of the study makes one of the drugs in question, and whether the drugs are experimental or on the market. Osteoporosis is a well-known risk factor for fracture, especially among older women. It can also be screened for with x-rays that measure bone density. A number of different treatments exist for individuals with osteoporosis and this news release presents data from a published study in JAMA. For most individuals with osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements are recommended if dietary consumption isn’t adequate. First-line medications to decrease fracture risk is a group called the bisphosphonates. These medicines have been around for several decades and are usually taken by mouth on a weekly basis or by injection once a year. For individuals who are at particularly high risk, including those who have had a fracture while taking a bisphosphonate, second-line therapy is considered. These medicines include teriparatides that are given as a daily injection under the skin. The current study compares a new version of this class of drug, abaloparatide, to placebo and teriparatide. As a related editorial highlights, there are a number of effective medicines to prevent fractures in those with osteoporosis and they are probably under-used. For most individuals, use of existing oral medicines should be the focus of initial treatment. The current study focuses on giving patients who didn’t respond to the initial therapy or other high risk individuals another option.",Injected Drug Reduces Risk of Fracture among Women with Osteoporosis,"This news release describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 20,000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis of the spine and/or hip who were treated with either a new drug called abaloparatide or a placebo for two years. The release does a good job of quantifying the benefits of the drugs and the placebo in both relative and absolute terms. It also does a good job of describing the study in a clear and concise way. However, the release does not mention the cost of the existing FDA-approved comparator drug, which is a notable omission. The release also does not describe the side effects of the drugs, and it does not make the novelty of the findings clear.

241,"### Context: The Naples Daily News reports that a $150,000 grant from the Fish & Wildlife Foundation will fund scientists researching a troubling neuromuscular disorder afflicting the state’s panthers and bobcats. Every “Conserve Wildlife Florida” tag featuring a Florida black bear delivers $25 to the nonprofit foundation, which supports Florida’s rare species and other nongame wildlife. Wildlife biologists will use the grant to collect and analyze images from trail cameras in the cats’ habitat as well as perform diagnostic tests on the animals. The illness has remained a puzzle. Affected big felines have damaged myelin, an insulating sheath that protects nerve cells. The disorder causes it to break down, which also occurs in some human neurodegenerative such as multiple sclerosis. “We termed the condition feline leukomyelopathy based on the microscopic changes seen in the brain and spine. We continue to learn more about it but have not yet determined a cause, as well as what can be done to prevent further panthers from acquiring the disease,” Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission veterinarian Mark Cunningham told the paper last year.

242,"### Context: The claim that a Johns Hopkins scientist issued a ""blistering report"" on flu vaccine dangers in the British Medical Journal is not accurate. The article referenced a 2013 feature by Peter Doshi in the British Medical Journal, which was greatly exaggerated by natural news sites. Doshi is not a virologist or epidemiologist, but an anthropologist who completed a fellowship in comparative effectiveness research at Johns Hopkins. He conducted no research on influenza or vaccines at Johns Hopkins and does not speak for the university on that subject.

Doshi argued in his feature that the potential risks of aggressive vaccination against the flu have not been highlighted sufficiently and that the benefits of the flu shot are overestimated. However, he did not prove that the flu vaccine may not be beneficial at all. He mainly focused on the fact that the vaccine is not 100% effective and does not work for everyone.

The article also quoted Dr. Russell Blaylock, a former neurosurgeon, who claimed that flu vaccines don't prevent the flu but actually increase the odds of getting it. Blaylock has a history of issuing dubious warnings and conspiracy theories. He insinuates that the H1N1 virus may be a man-made virus purposely released by someone with the ""Illuminati Depopulation Agenda.""

The claim that flu vaccines are a large moneymaker for pharmaceutical companies is also debunked. Flu vaccines generate less than 0.3% of worldwide sales of Big Pharma, and vaccines, in general, have lower net profits than other pharmaceuticals. Additionally, data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows that tens of thousands of people, including many healthy individuals, die each year from the flu. The CDC reported that 90% of juvenile patients who died of the flu in a particular season had not been vaccinated.

In conclusion, the claim that a Johns Hopkins scientist issued a ""blistering report"" on flu vaccine dangers is not accurate. The article referenced a feature by Peter Doshi in the British Medical Journal, which was exaggerated by natural news sites. The claims made by Doshi and echoed by Dr. Russell Blaylock are based on flawed premises and conspiracy theories. The flu vaccine is beneficial and can help prevent serious complications and deaths from the flu.

243,"### Context: Saudi Arabia has deported 2,870 Ethiopian migrants to Addis Ababa since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.N. migration agency. An internal U.N. memo suggests that Saudi Arabia is expected to deport a total of 200,000 Ethiopian migrants. Other Gulf Arab states, Kenya, and neighboring countries are also expected to repatriate Ethiopian migrants. The U.N. is calling for the temporary suspension of large-scale deportations to prevent the spread of the virus. Saudi Arabia has reported 4,934 confirmed cases of COVID-19, while Ethiopia has reported only 74 cases and two deaths.

Ethiopian authorities have confirmed the large-scale deportations and stated that some of the deported migrants have tested positive for the coronavirus, although exact numbers are not available. All migrants will be tested for the virus and quarantined for 14 days in closed schools and universities.

The U.S. State Department reported last year that around 100,000 Ethiopians travel illegally to Saudi Arabia annually, attracted by promises of work and a better life. It is estimated that there are around 200,000 Ethiopians living in Saudi Arabia. Concerns have been raised by a humanitarian aid organization that the frequency and large numbers of deportees involved could overwhelm Ethiopia's quarantine system. The aid group also highlighted the vulnerability of these migrants, who often arrive in Ethiopia with high medical and mental health needs.

The Saudi media ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Many migrant workers worldwide have been left unemployed due to economic lockdowns imposed by governments to contain the spread of the virus.

244,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by GOP Senate candidate Ed Gillespie that Obamacare ""cuts seniors' Medicare."" The article states that this claim has been frequently examined by PolitiFact over the years. Gillespie's campaign spokesman, Paul Logan, supports this claim by referring to fact checks conducted by PolitiFact. However, PolitiFact has found that the claim that Obamacare cuts Medicare is a complicated issue and has rated similar statements as either Half True or Mostly False, depending on how they are worded.

Obamacare includes measures to reduce the increase in Medicare spending by $716 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office. However, it is important to note that Medicare spending will still continue to rise, but at a slower pace than it would have without the law. The savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies, not beneficiaries.

Gillespie's claim suggests that Obamacare not only reduces Medicare spending but also slices Medicare benefits. Logan supports this line of reasoning by referring to PolitiFact articles that suggest the reduced payments could affect patients' access to services. For example, there are concerns that slowing growth in Medicare payments might discourage some healthcare providers from accepting Medicare patients. Additionally, the Medicare Advantage program, which is run by private insurers and offers greater benefits than traditional Medicare, may be affected by the cost savings measures in Obamacare. Some analysts have suggested that these savings might lead to higher premiums or the loss of extra benefits for Medicare Advantage enrollees.

However, the article also mentions that Obamacare adds some new services, such as closing the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage, funding illness prevention benefits, and expanding preventative care benefits.

Overall, the article concludes that while there is debate among analysts about how the cost savings measures in Obamacare will impact beneficiaries, particularly those enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, the claim that Obamacare ""cuts seniors' Medicare"" is not entirely accurate. The law does slow Medicare's growth, but spending will still rise significantly, and some new services for seniors were added.
Claim: Obamacare ""cuts seniors’ Medicare.

### Explanation:
",false,"Gillespie says Obamacare ""cuts seniors’ Medicare,"" a statement that implies the law is reducing benefits across the board. There’s debate among analysts over how the law’s cost savings measures will impact some beneficiaries, particularly seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers.

245,"### Context: Author Stephen King tweeted on March 8, 2020, stating that the COVID-19 pandemic was not as serious as the virus depicted in his novel ""The Stand."" He mentioned that the spread of the coronavirus was ""eminently survivable"" and advised people to remain calm and take reasonable precautions. However, a Twitter user responded to King's tweet, asking if he had even read the book he wrote.

The comparison between COVID-19 and the virus in ""The Stand"" has been circulating on social media during the pandemic. ""The Stand"" is a novel from 1978 that portrays a deadly virus called ""Captain Trips"" with a mortality rate of 99.4 percent. King clarified that COVID-19 was not as serious as the virus in his book.

New research published in The Lancet on March 12, 2020, suggested that the mortality rate of COVID-19 might be higher than previously estimated. The study indicated that the mortality rate could be between five and six percent, which is higher than the commonly cited 3.4 percent rate. However, it is significantly lower than the 99.4 percent rate depicted in ""The Stand.""

The Twitter user's response to King's tweet was taken out of context. The user's account was dedicated to trolling and engaging in sarcastic debates. The response asking if King had read his own book was meant to provoke a pointless argument.

In summary, Stephen King tweeted that COVID-19 was not as serious as the virus in his novel ""The Stand."" A Twitter user sarcastically asked if King had even read the book he wrote. However, the response was from a troll account and should not be taken seriously.

246,"### Context: The article discusses the authenticity of an alleged ""Antifa manual"" that was circulated on social media in August 2017. The manual gained traction around the same time as a flyer from the anti-fascist group calling for the murder of white children was being circulated. The article highlights that both documents share similar characteristics and are fraudulent.

The article mentions that there are various claims about where and how the manual was found, with some asserting that it was found at Evergreen State College and others claiming it was found at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. However, the earliest posting of the manual was on Imgur on August 12, 2017, by a user named ""Jebediah88,"" which the Anti-Defamation League explains is a white supremacist numerical code for ""Heil Hitler.""

The article emphasizes that there is no overarching Antifa organization or leadership. Instead, there are loosely organized Antifa groups around the world. These groups monitor and track the activities of local neo-Nazis, expose them to their communities, conduct public education campaigns, support migrants and refugees, and pressure venues to cancel white power events. The majority of Antifa organizing is nonviolent, but they are willing to physically defend themselves and others from white supremacist violence.

The actual text of the alleged Antifa manual contains passages that contradict what is known about Antifa groups. For example, the cover page states that the manual should not be given to cis white males, non-PoC, and non-LGBTQ individuals. However, these individuals are welcome members of Antifa groups. Other passages in the manual read like satire or spout conspiracy theories that do not align with Antifa's messages.

The article also mentions that the NYC Antifa group confirmed that the manual is fake and directed readers to genuine literature published by Antifa-supporting outlets, such as the anarchist news website It's Going Down. The genuine manual, titled ""Forming An Antifa Group: A Manual,"" focuses on tracking and opposing white supremacist groups and does not label cisgender white men as the ""greatest evil mankind has ever known.""

In summary, the article concludes that the alleged Antifa manual is fake and highlights the contradictions between the manual and the actual beliefs and actions of Antifa groups.

248,"### Context: The article discusses two cases of women who sought medical help to remove foreign objects they had used for self-pleasuring purposes. In one case, a married woman went to the gynecologist complaining of a malodorous discharge. The doctor discovered that the cells in her pap smear were not human and upon further examination, found a large piece of loose, decaying flesh that resembled a long tongue. The woman confessed that she had taken the tongue from a deer her husband had hunted and had used it as a masturbatory aid, but had forgotten about it. 

In another case, a 29-year-old woman visited a clinic seeking termination of a possible pregnancy. The examining physician found and removed a cylindrical mass of pale-gray tissue from her vagina. Further questioning revealed that the object was a deer tongue that she had used for masturbation. The article does not provide details about how the woman obtained the deer tongue or how long it had been lodged in her vagina.

The authors of the article explain that cases of autoeroticism involving foreign objects are not commonly reported in medical literature because they do not result in death or injury. They mention that foreign bodies retrieved from the female bladder or urethra are often a result of masturbation, and large objects found in the vagina are mostly found in married women aged 17-30, with bananas, cucumbers, and other large vegetables being the most common objects used.

The article highlights that the motivation for presenting these case histories in a medical journal is to shed light on nonlethal autoerotic practices, as most literature on the topic focuses on death or injury. The authors also mention that there have been 18 recorded cases of foreign body insertion for erotic purposes, with only three involving women. They suggest that acts of autoeroticism involving vaginal masturbation with foreign objects may be more common but often go unreported.

Overall, the article confirms the claim that a woman sought medical help to remove a deer tongue she had used for self-pleasuring purposes. It also provides additional information about the prevalence of foreign body insertion for erotic purposes and the lack of reporting on nonlethal autoerotic practices.

249,"### Context: Tim O'Brien, a campaign adviser for Mike Bloomberg, accused Bernie Sanders of saying ""loopy stuff"" about orgasms, cervical cancer, children's nudity, and women's rape fantasies in a CNN interview. O'Brien's claim was based on essays Sanders wrote for a left-leaning alternative newspaper about 50 years ago. Bloomberg's campaign cited articles from 2015 in the New York Times and Mother Jones that examined Sanders' writings from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Sanders' writings became controversial during his 2016 presidential campaign. 

Regarding O'Brien's specific claims, it was found that he misspoke about the cancer and orgasms statement. Sanders actually wrote about the possibility that lack of sex, rather than too much sex, could lead to poor health or cancer. O'Brien also claimed that Sanders wrote about toddlers running around naked and touching each other's genitals to insulate themselves from porn. In reality, Sanders wrote about the potential consequences of a world where toddlers were not chastised for public nudity, which could negatively impact the porn industry. Lastly, O'Brien mentioned Sanders writing about women's rape fantasies. Sanders did write about this topic in an essay on gender stereotypes, where he discussed changing gender roles and suggested that men and women should reconsider how they relate to each other.

Overall, O'Brien's statement about Sanders making these claims was found to be inaccurate or misrepresented. Sanders' writings from decades ago were often critical of cultural oppression and explored alternative perspectives on sexuality and gender roles.

250,"### Context: The claim that John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has proposed forcing abortions and putting sterilants in the drinking water to control population is not true. The claim originated from a book Holdren co-authored called ""Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment"" over three decades ago. The book discusses various approaches to population control, including ""coercive"" methods like putting sterilants in the drinking water. However, the authors stop short of advocating for these measures and state that they are not currently feasible or acceptable. They argue that expanding access to milder methods of influencing family size preferences and ensuring access to birth control, including abortion and sterilization, is a better approach. Holdren's office and the co-authors of the book have both stated that they do not support coercive means of population control and that the quotes used to suggest otherwise were taken out of context. Holdren himself has stated that he does not believe determining optimal population is a proper role of government and that the focus should be on improving the well-being of citizens. The article concludes that Glenn Beck's claim mischaracterizes Holdren's positions and that it is irresponsible to use a few lines from a 1,000-page textbook to dismiss Holdren's career.

251,"### Context: The claim that a Michigan farmer was forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries to make way for imported cherries is partially true. In July 2016, Michigan cherry farmer Marc Santucci posted on Facebook that he had to dump 14% of his tart cherry crop to protect the market for imported cherries. The post gained attention on social media and attracted blogs and health-conscious users. Online articles blamed the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the cherry destruction, citing the federal Agricultural Agreement Act of 1937. However, the act only applies to the tart cherry industry because growers and processors voluntarily opted into the order in 1995.

The marketing order imposed by the USDA aims to stabilize farmers' income and create better stability in the market. The Cherry Industry Administrative Board (CIAB) oversees the marketing order in all states that produce commercial crops of red tart cherries. The order requires tart cherry processors to keep a certain percentage of the crop off traditional markets to stabilize prices and supply. In Santucci's case, he claimed he was ordered to dump only 14% of his crop, but the order actually required processors to keep 29% off the market.

The Agricultural Agreement Act ensures relatively stable income for tart cherry farmers, but it can result in surplus cherries that farmers are not allowed to sell on the open market. However, farmers have options such as freezing, drying, or concentrating the surplus cherries for later use. They can also sell them in overseas markets or convince supermarkets to switch to U.S.-grown cherries.

Contrary to Santucci's claim, farmers are allowed to use the dumped cherries for research and development or make products like pies and jams. The blame for cherry dumping lies with the processors, not the marketing order. Santucci stated that he was not given enough time to find alternative actions for his surplus cherries due to their short shelf life.

In conclusion, while the claim that a Michigan farmer was forced to destroy 40,000 edible cherries is partially true, the destruction was not mandated by the marketing order or to protect imported cherries. The marketing order aims to stabilize the market and provide better income for farmers, and farmers have options for dealing with surplus cherries.

252,"### Context: Greece has quarantined a second migrant camp after a case of COVID-19 was confirmed. The infected individual is an Afghan man who lives with his family at the Malakasa camp, just north of Athens. He has been transferred to a hospital in Athens, and tests on his contacts will continue as authorities try to trace the route of the virus. Greece confirmed 62 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total in the country to 1,735, with 73 deaths. Last week, the Ritsona camp in central Greece was sealed off after 20 people tested positive for the virus, making it the first such facility in the country to be affected. 

Greece has been the main gateway into the European Union for people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond, with over a million people reaching its shores from Turkey in 2015-16. Currently, at least 110,000 people live in migrant facilities, with 40,000 of them in overcrowded camps on five islands. The Migration Minister acknowledged that the large number of migrants and refugees makes it mathematically likely that there will be confirmed cases of COVID-19. The government has an emergency plan in place, but it is more difficult to implement on the islands. 

No cases have been recorded in camps on Greek islands so far. The conservative government plans to replace all existing camps on islands with enclosed detention centers, but this has faced resistance from local authorities and residents who want all facilities shut down. The government also wants new arrivals to be isolated from the rest of the migrants, but most islands have not designated areas of accommodation for this purpose. About 120 people who recently arrived on Lesbos have not yet found shelter. Aid groups have urged Greece to evacuate the camps, warning that the risk of the virus spreading among people living in squalid conditions is high and containing an outbreak in such settings would be ""impossible"". 

The Malakasa camp, where the infected Afghan man resides, will be put into quarantine for two weeks, with reinforced police presence to ensure the restrictions are implemented. A separate enclosed facility has been operating since last month for migrants who arrived after March 1. Greece has imposed a nationwide lockdown and banned arrivals from non-EU countries, as well as Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain. These measures have negatively impacted the country's economy, which is relying on tourism for recovery after a decade-long debt crisis.

254,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests strobe lighting could potentially be used as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The study, which was conducted on mice, found that exposure to flickering lights at a specific frequency could reduce the levels of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, which are believed to be a key factor in the development of Alzheimer's. The researchers believe that the flickering lights stimulate brain waves, which in turn help to clear the plaques. The study's senior author, Li-Huei Tsai, states that if humans respond similarly to mice, the potential of this treatment is enormous.

However, the article points out several limitations and concerns with the study. Firstly, the research was conducted on mice, so it is unclear whether the treatment would have any benefit for humans. The article also notes that the causes of Alzheimer's are still a subject of debate within the research community, and the idea that toxic proteins are solely responsible is not universally accepted. Additionally, the article highlights that the study is still in its early stages and there is not enough information to determine potential harms or the timeline for human trials.

The article expresses disappointment with the lack of background information provided about the state of Alzheimer's research and treatment options. It suggests that the story would be better suited for research audiences rather than the general public. The article also criticizes the conflation of dementia with Alzheimer's, and the lack of context about the devastating impact of the disease.

Overall, the article raises concerns about the relevance and limitations of the study, and suggests that more information about current treatments and research in the field would have provided better context. It also highlights the conflict of interest of the study's senior author, who has formed a company to pursue this treatment. The article concludes by questioning the availability and timeline of the treatment, and suggests that more research is needed to establish its therapeutic potential in humans.
Claim: Strobe lighting provides a flicker of hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story describes a study in which genetically engineered mice were exposed to an hour of pulsing light daily for a week, with the result that certain toxins associated with Alzheimer’s disease were dramatically reduced in their brains. The story suggests the flickering lights are an intriguing, non-invasive, and probably inexpensive idea that could hold promise for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in humans. There is a major disclaimer: “The authors caution that a ‘big if’ remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.” This is a story that admits many of the limitations of the research it cites, but initially draws people in with a headline that promises much more than the research has so far delivered. The study cited was published in a top journal and could represent a meaningful step on the way toward innovative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The operative word, however, is “could.” This research is years away from impacting human lives, if indeed the findings end up being relevant to humans at all–and that needed to be explained better. Furthermore, the heavy use of medical terminology and a confusing explanation of the rationale behind the study could make it hard for many people to pick up on just how far from application the findings really are. This is a study that is important for researchers, but one we think probably didn’t need a wide general audience in mainstream news publications. Alzheimer’s is a tragic disease that impacts hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is excruciating not only for victims but for caregivers who watch their loved ones incrementally being taken away from them. Hopeful headlines about results of mouse trials–the vast majority of which don’t translate into benefits to humans anyway–seem irresponsible. Couldn’t we use our line space for something more relevant? If not, here’s how we recommend framing these kind of stories.",Strobe lighting provides a flicker of hope in the fight against Alzheimer’s,"This story reports on a study that found that exposing mice to strobe lights at a specific frequency reduced the amount of amyloid plaques in their brains.

255,"### Context: The article titled ""U.S. Panel Questions Prostate Screening"" discusses the new guidelines released by the US Preventive Services Task Force regarding routine screening for prostate cancer in men over the age of 75. The article mentions that there was no discussion of the costs associated with prostate cancer screening, but states that cost is not relevant to the discussion as the new recommendation is to cease routine screening for this age group. However, it suggests that it would have been helpful to include some mention of the potential costs of screening older men and the cost savings associated with cessation of screening.

The article highlights that the benefits of routine screening for prostate cancer are uncertain and mentions the common side effects of treatment for the disease. It also mentions that the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is far greater than the number who die from it, putting the natural history of most prostate cancers into context.

The article includes comments from various individuals with relevant expertise, but does not indicate whether they served on the recommendation task force, except for Ned Calonge who was mentioned as the chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force.

The article focuses on the new recommendation regarding routine screening of men over the age of 75 with a PSA test. It presents arguments both for and against the use of the test and mentions that it is readily available. The article reports on the release of the new guidelines and highlights that they differ from the previous version by stating that the benefit of routine screening for prostate cancer in men over 75 is minimal or nonexistent, while the harms are moderate to substantial.

Overall, the article provides a balanced view by including quotes from experts with differing viewpoints and does not solely rely on a press release for information. However, it does not discuss the potential costs of screening older men or the cost savings associated with cessation of screening.
Claim: U.S. Panel Questions Prostate Screening
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story describes the newly released recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on the utility of routine PSA testing. It highlighted the importance of the new recommendation, namely that the task force indicated that routine testing of men older than 75 resulted in little to no benefit. The story attempted to provide a picture for the reader of reasons for the ambiguity about routine prostate cancer screening and the important trade-off between common side effects and treatment of a disease that often is not problematic. It included quotes from experts who had different opinions about how to consider the risks and benefits of routine testing for, and various treatment of, prostate cancer.",U.S. Panel Questions Prostate Screening,"This is a well-written, informative piece that reports on the release of a new set of guidelines regarding routine prostate cancer screening in men over the age of 75.

The story does a good job of putting the natural history of most prostate cancers into context."
256,"### Context: The claim that a babysitter in Cincinnati, Ohio was admitted to a local hospital after paramedics found a toddler wedged in her vagina is false. The article from World News Daily Report, a notorious purveyor of fake news, reported this incident. However, the content on the site is fictional, as stated on its own disclaimer page.

There is no evidence to support the claim that a 31-year-old Cincinnati woman was taken to the hospital after a 14-month-old toddler she was babysitting got stuck in her vaginal cavity. The article from World News Daily Report is entirely fabricated.

It is important to be cautious when consuming news from sources that are known for spreading fake news. In this case, the claim is outrageous and lacks any credibility.

257,"### Context: The claim that the photographs show a boy having his arm crushed under a truck as a punishment for stealing bread is false. The photographs actually depict a street act performed by performers who stage the act to hustle money from onlookers. The act involves a subject seemingly allowing himself to be run over by a heavy vehicle and then emerging unscathed. This is a common act performed by many magicians and is accomplished through various means, with no lasting harm done. The boy in the photographs is not seriously or permanently injured by the process, despite his contorted facial expressions.

It is important to note that the photographs do not depict any form of amputation, and it is the child's left arm that goes under the wheels, not his right arm as would be the case in a punishment involving amputation. Additionally, there are no police, judges, religious authorities, or other officials evident in any of the pictures. Instead, there is a huckster with a hand-held microphone who drums up business and describes the action for the onlookers.

The claim that the punishment depicted in the photographs is a result of Sharia law is also debunked. While it is difficult to make definitive statements about Sharia/Islamic law due to regional variations, Islamic law resources consistently note that punishments such as amputation shall not be applied to children who have not yet reached puberty or for the theft of small-value items or food by the hungry. The maximum penalty of hand-cutting applies after considering factors such as track record and whether the theft was made for profit. In some cases, such as stealing food due to severe hunger or to prevent death, there may not be a penalty.

In conclusion, the photographs circulating on the internet do not depict a punishment under Sharia law. They are actually images of a street act performed by performers to hustle money from onlookers. The boy in the photographs is not seriously injured, and the act is not a form of amputation punishment.

258,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that Iran has been caught cheating on the interim nuclear deal. The interim agreement, known as the Joint Plan of Action, was put in place to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for certain concessions. The article examines two potential violations of the agreement.

The first potential violation involves Iran's work with a new model of centrifuge. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran had been intermittently feeding uranium fluoride into the IR-5 centrifuge, which was not allowed under the agreement. However, experts disagree on whether this constitutes a clear violation of the agreement. While some believe it is a violation, others argue that it is not cut and dried.

The second potential violation involves Iran selling more oil than allowed under the agreement. The Joint Plan of Action does not specify specific caps on oil sales, but rather states that countries can continue to buy their current average amounts of crude oil. It is unclear whether Iran's oil sales violate the terms of the agreement, as the details of the implementation agreement are not publicly available.

Overall, the article concludes that while there are actions by Iran that come close to violating the terms of the agreement, there is no definitive evidence of cheating. The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. While there are some actions that raise questions, such as Iran's work with a new centrifuge and its oil sales, it is unclear whether these actions constitute violations of the agreement.

In summary, the claim that Iran has been caught cheating on the interim nuclear deal is not supported by definitive evidence. While there are actions by Iran that raise questions, there is no clear violation of the agreement.
Claim: We've caught Iran cheating on the interim (nuclear) deal.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Hayes said Iran had been caught cheating on the interim deal to rein in Iran’s nuclear program, called the Joint Plan of Action. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported no violations with the Joint Plan of Action. That said, there are some actions by Iran that certainly cut near the boundaries of the terms of the agreement. Iran has worked with a new kind of centrifuge that, while perhaps not a formal violation, does seem to contradict the United States’ understanding of the deal, an expert told us. When confronted on the matter, Iran stopped its work. Also, there is some question about the amount of oil Iran is exporting. But an expert said we just don’t have enough information to determine whether that constitutes a violation of the agreement or not. Hayes said we caught Iran cheating. You can say some allege that, and you can say there’s some evidence that might suggest that. But we found no hand in the cookie jar.

The incident occurred on May 13th and the girl was taken to Texas Children's Hospital at The Woodlands, near Houston. An x-ray confirmed that the object was lodged in her esophagus. The girl successfully underwent surgery to remove the object. The incident was not a result of a property or mechanism intrinsic to the fidget spinner itself, but rather the girl accidentally swallowing a part of it while cleaning it. The Consumer Product Safety Commission advises parents to be aware of choking hazards with any small toy and to consider how their child interacts with toys.

The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,Keep any toy with small parts away from young children. They can be a choking hazard.,A Texas girl required surgery after she swallowed part of a fidget spinner while cleaning it.,What's true: A Texas girl was hospitalized after she swallowed a part of a fidget spinner while cleaning it.

260,"### Context: The article discusses a study that used a combination of probiotics and peanut oral immunotherapy to treat peanut allergies in children. The study found that 67% of children who received the combination therapy were able to comfortably eat peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not receive the treatment. The children in the treated group also had fewer allergic reactions to peanuts and showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.

However, the article raises concerns about the lack of information regarding the cost of the treatment and potential harms associated with it. It mentions that oral immunotherapy, the type of immunotherapy used in the study, has been shown to be effective in desensitizing peanut-allergic children but comes with a high risk of allergic adverse events. The article criticizes the lack of acknowledgement of these risks in the story.

The article also highlights issues with the evidence discussion in the story. It mentions that the study was a follow-up to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, but this information was not included in the story. The number of participants in the study was also not mentioned, which is important for understanding the robustness of the findings. The article argues that the story should have provided more numbers on the outcomes assessed in the study to give readers a better perspective.

Conflicts of interest are another concern raised by the article. It mentions that the study was initially funded by the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and the Australian Food Allergy Foundation, and later received funding from a capital investment firm and a biotech company. The article suggests that the story should have addressed these conflicts of interest.

The article concludes by stating that the story did include input from an independent source, but did not clearly address conflicts of interest. It also notes that the story did not provide information on standard treatments or the development process of the combination therapy. The novelty of the study is inferred but not explicitly stated. The article suggests that the headline of the story, which claims that the therapy may cure kids of peanut allergy, may be misleading given the uncertainties and limitations of the study.

Overall, the article criticizes the story for not adequately addressing the cost, harms, conflicts of interest, and limitations of the study. It also suggests that more information on standard treatments and the development process of the combination therapy would have strengthened the story.
Claim: A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story focuses on a long-term follow-up study of patients with peanut allergies who had received immunotherapy and probiotics to minimize allergic response to peanuts. A story in a nationwide publication that suggests there may be a “cure” for peanut allergies — such as the story we are reviewing here — would likely raise hopes for families and individuals living with peanut allergies. But those hopes would be unfounded. The research this story was based on involved fewer than 50 patients, only 24 of whom received the relevant treatment — something the story doesn’t tell readers. And the treatment was not universally successful at eliminating peanut allergy even for those 24 patients. What’s more, there is no discussion in the story of costs or risks associated with treatment. The word “cure” should never be used hastily, something we just pointed out about a different TIME story last week. The NIH states that “peanut allergy is a growing health problem for which no treatment or cure exists. People living with peanut allergy, and their caregivers, must be vigilant about the foods they eat and the environments they enter to avoid allergic reactions, which can be severe and even life-threatening.” A 2010 study stated that 1.4 percent of people in the U.S. report having an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts. In short, peanut allergy poses very real risks for those with peanut allergies, and can pose a particular challenge for parents of children with peanut allergies — who have to maintain constant vigilance regarding the possibility of peanut contamination in places where their kids eat, play or attend school. As a result, new research findings related to addressing peanut allergies garner a lot of attention. This story may leave readers with more questions than answers.",A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy,"This story reports on a small, short-term study of a combination therapy for peanut allergy. The story does a good job of describing the study and the potential benefits of the therapy. However, the story does not address costs, harms, or limitations of the study. The story also does not provide enough information on the study’s design or the standard treatments. The headline, “A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy,” is misleading. The study was not designed to test the ability of the therapy to cure peanut allergy. The study was designed to test the ability of the therapy to desensitize peanut-allergic children. The story should have been more clear about this."
261,"### Context: The Indian government has decided to allow limited exports of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and the pain reliever paracetamol, after initially putting a hold on exports due to depleting stocks caused by disruptions in global supply chains. This decision comes after US President Donald Trump spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and warned of retaliation if the ban on exports was not lifted. India's neighboring countries, including Nepal, have also requested supplies of HCQ. The Indian foreign ministry spokesperson announced that India would license paracetamol and HCQ in appropriate quantities to neighboring countries and to nations that have been severely affected by the pandemic. The use of HCQ has increased in the United States, which has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, although its effectiveness is still uncertain. The US has reported a high number of fatalities from the virus. In addition to lifting the ban on HCQ and paracetamol exports, the Indian government has also lifted restrictions on the export of 24 pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines made from them, including antibiotics, hormones, and vitamins. The foreign ministry spokesperson stated that these restrictions were lifted after confirming the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies currently envisaged.

262,"### Context: The article discusses a study conducted by researchers at The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, which found that intermittent fasting in mice can help fight obesity and other metabolic disorders. The study suggests that up to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting without counting calories can have benefits after only six weeks. The researchers discovered that intermittent fasting kick-starts the animals' metabolism and helps burn fat by generating body heat.

However, the article criticizes the release for not providing important information such as the costs of the mice chow used in the study and the number of mice involved. It also points out that the release lacks specific details about the benefits of intermittent fasting, such as the amount of weight loss achieved by the fasting group compared to the control group.

The release mentions that intermittent fasting has an impact on the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation, but it does not provide specific measurements or context for these changes. It also fails to mention any potential harms associated with intermittent fasting.

The article highlights that the release does not acknowledge the limitations of the study or the fact that animal studies are rarely replicated in humans. The authors of the study called for further research to examine the long-term effects of intermittent fasting, potential harms, and whether the benefits apply to all generations and disease conditions.

The release does not discuss current methods of obesity treatment or prevention, nor does it claim novelty in the field of intermittent fasting. The authors of the study acknowledge that others have already established the ability of intermittent fasting to promote weight loss, but they have identified a mechanism that explains why weight loss occurs in fasting mice.

The article concludes by criticizing the headline of the release, which states ""On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity,"" as it may mislead readers into thinking the study was conducted on humans rather than mice. The release only clarifies this in the fourth sentence.

Overall, the article highlights the lack of important information and context provided in the release, as well as the need for further research to fully understand the effects and potential harms of intermittent fasting.
Claim: On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release describes a study about intermittent fasting in mice, in which the mice that fasted weighed less four months later than the mice that did not fast. The finding described in the news release only applied to mice being fed a high fat diet (45 percent from fat), whereas when on normal chow and intermittent fasting on normal chow, there wasn’t much difference. The release was short on numbers and descriptions of measurements used, and implied that the mouse studies could benefit people, without any caveats that such a transfer of mouse discovery to practical application in humans often fails. The release did name the funders and avoided sensationalizing obesity. Obesity is an enormous public health problem. But this release misleads the reader into thinking its conclusions will transfer from the mice in the study to human patients with obesity. We were disappointed by this quote from one of the researchers: “Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,” says Kyoung-Han Kim.” Based on the published study, we don’t find any evidence that this has been proven for human patients.

263,"### Context: The New York Times published an editorial stating that the federal government should allow states to decide on marijuana legalization. Ruth Marcus, a columnist for the Washington Post, expressed concern about states loosening marijuana laws, particularly in relation to teenagers. She cited a 2012 study from Duke University that found teenagers who regularly used marijuana before the age of 18 experienced an average drop of about eight IQ points. The study did not prove causation, but suggested that marijuana could disrupt brain development in teenagers. However, a year later, another analysis by Ole Rogeberg, a Norwegian economist, argued that the Duke study's results could be explained by socioeconomic factors. Rogeberg claimed that children from poorer households would naturally have lower IQ scores over time due to less mentally demanding work. Madeline Meier, the lead researcher of the Duke study, responded by stating that her team had considered socioeconomic factors and still found a loss in intelligence tied to marijuana use. Annette Dobson, a statistician at the University of Queensland, supported Rogeberg's argument, suggesting that the small sample size of long-term pot users in the study limited the ability to account for confounding factors. In conclusion, Marcus's claim that teenagers who use marijuana regularly will lose eight IQ points overstates the findings of the Duke study. The study showed a higher risk of losing IQ points, but did not guarantee that a person would lose that many points. Additionally, an alternative analysis suggested that IQ loss could be attributed to household incomes rather than marijuana use. There is no scientific consensus on the issue, and Marcus ignored the ongoing debate.
Claim: The best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Marcus said the best evidence shows that teenagers who start smoking marijuana will lose eight IQ points. This overstates the actual underlying report. It would be more accurate to say the study showed a higher risk of losing that many points on an IQ test, not that a person necessarily would. More fundamentally, an equally reputable analysis found that IQ loss could be tied to household incomes as much as marijuana use. Clearly, a scientific consensus has yet to emerge, and Marcus ignored the ongoing debate.",The best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points.,"Marcus said, """"The best evidence is that you lose -- if you use marijuana as a teenager regularly -- eight IQ points.""""

264,"### Context: Bobby Wilson, a candidate for the Arizona State Senate, has been involved in a controversy surrounding a shooting incident that occurred in 1963. Wilson had previously shared a personal story during a public meeting in which he claimed to have used a gun to defend himself against an attacker. However, it has now been revealed that the person he shot was his own mother, whom he killed, and his teenage sister was also beaten to death in the same incident.

Wilson's account of the incident prompted an investigation by the Arizona Republic newspaper, which uncovered disturbing details from the episode. According to court records and news reports from the time, Wilson initially gave shifting accounts of his involvement in the incident. He claimed that he was awakened by an explosion and fled the family home before it went up in flames. However, autopsies later confirmed that his mother and sister had died before the fire started. Wilson eventually confessed to killing both women and setting fire to the house.

Wilson's first trial for murder ended in a mistrial in 1965, but he was set to be retried in 1966. His lawyers argued that he suffered from amnesia and could not remember the events of the night in question. A psychiatrist testified that Wilson had a complete amnesia for that period of time. The jury sided with Wilson, but the case was suspended, leaving open the possibility of future trials if Wilson were to recover his memories.

In 1973, the murder charges against Wilson were dismissed due to the seven-year delay in the case, which was deemed unreasonable and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. Wilson went on to pursue a career in law, practicing in Texas before moving to Arizona. However, he faced controversy in Texas when he was convicted of forgery and suspended from practicing law. He later resigned from the State Bar of Texas, claiming persecution.

In his memoirs, published in 2010, Wilson claimed that he never confessed to killing his mother and sister and accused corrupt police of lying about the case. He stated that he regained his memories of the incident years later while visiting a crime scene. Wilson described the events of that night in a different manner than previously recorded, claiming that his mother attacked him with a rifle and he shot her in self-defense.

The controversy surrounding Wilson's past has raised questions about his credibility and suitability for public office.

265,"### Context: Utah Governor Gary Herbert has signed a bill into law that bans abortions after 18 weeks, sparking a legal battle. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Utah argues that the law is unconstitutional, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that states cannot ban abortion before the fetus is viable outside the womb, typically around 23 weeks. Planned Parenthood of Utah also criticized the law, stating that it is part of a broader agenda to gradually ban abortion. The ban adds to existing abortion restrictions in Utah, such as a 72-hour waiting period and an in-person informed consent session. 

The signing of this law comes as abortion opponents in the U.S. are encouraged by President Donald Trump's appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices and are seeking cases to challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. Other states, including Arkansas, have also signed 18-week abortion bans, while some have considered or passed proposals to ban abortion even earlier, once a fetal heartbeat can be detected.

Governor Herbert's spokesperson stated that he is against abortion and believes that the law strikes an appropriate balance between respecting a woman's right to choose and protecting the unborn. The law does allow for exceptions in cases of rape, fatal fetal deformity, or serious detriment to the mother's health. Governor Herbert is not concerned about the potential cost of a lawsuit, estimated at around $2 million if the state loses.

The sponsor of the bill, Republican Representative Cheryl Acton, introduced it with the aim of reducing the number of second-trimester abortions that she believes ""shock the conscience."" Governor Herbert has also signed a law this year that bans abortion solely based on a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome, but this law will only go into effect if a similar measure is upheld elsewhere.

Overall, the signing of this law in Utah has set the stage for a legal showdown, with opponents arguing that it is unconstitutional and violates the Supreme Court's precedent on abortion rights.

Pools of up to 20 ticks from each region were inspected for the existence of several diseases. The most common tick in North Dakota is the American dog tick, which is a close relative of the Rocky Mountain wood tick. Both are known for carrying the dreaded Rocky Mountain spotted fever virus which, if left untreated, can be deadly. American dog ticks and Rocky Mountain wood ticks made up 176 pools, with 106 testing positive for disease carrying pathogens. Deer ticks, which are known carriers of Lyme disease, were found in 22 of the 25 counties surveyed. Rancher John Heiser, of Grassy Butte, contributed nearly half of all the 13,640 ticks that were collected and sent to the state laboratory for disease testing. ___ Information from: Minot Daily News, http://www.minotdailynews.com

268,"### Context: Researchers at McMaster University have developed a simple paper test that can quickly diagnose illnesses by changing color. The test, which uses a small strip of paper, can detect the presence of infections and some cancers even before patients experience symptoms. The researchers claim that the test is inexpensive, but the exact cost is not specified in the article. The test strips would need to be specific to different diseases, but there is no information on the variety of strips required or how they compare in cost to laboratory diagnostic tests.

The article does not provide any hard numbers on the accuracy of the test strips or the benefits of early diagnosis for certain diseases. The potential spread of disease is not mentioned either. The sensitivity and accuracy of the paper diagnostics are not discussed, and it is unclear if they vary depending on the medium being analyzed (blood or urine). The risk of false or missed diagnosis is not addressed in the article.

The news release does not engage in disease mongering and lists all the funding sources for the project. The authors of the study are all affiliated with McMaster University, and the only corporate funder is Pro-Lab Diagnostics. It is unclear if any conflicts of interest exist between the authors and the funding source.

The article does not mention which alternative or conventional diagnostic tests the paper strips might replace. It does state that the technology is not currently available but could be commercialized quickly. However, the feasibility of this claim is questioned by the article.

The novelty of the test is also questioned, as paper diagnostic tools have been in development since at least 2007. The field of paper diagnostics is active, with several review papers published in recent years. The article does not provide enough context to determine what is novel about these new research findings or how they advance paper diagnostics.

In conclusion, the article discusses the development of a simple paper test for diagnosing illnesses. However, it lacks important information such as the cost of the test strips, their accuracy, and the potential risks of false or missed diagnosis. The article also questions the feasibility and novelty of the test.
Claim: Researchers Develop Simple Paper Test That Quickly Diagnoses Illnesses by Changing Colour
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Paper diagnostic test strip. Image: McMaster UniversityThis news release reports on the development of paper test strips that amplify DNA or RNA from blood, sweat or urine and determine if the person taking the test has a disease. The strips are made of a polymeric sugar film integrated with the paper device. Once a sample is applied the paper changes color to indicate the presence of a marker for a “specific bacterium, virus, or even cancer,” according to the release. The researchers quoted in the release claim that these test strips can be easily and inexpensively manufactured and, because they are portable, could be used to diagnose or self-diagnose illness (such as Ebola) in remote areas before the subject even knows they are ill. But the release does not make clear how such a test could be used to diagnose and differentiate between the multitudes of different diseases and conditions that afflict humans. Besides skirting other important details such as ballpark cost of the strips and data backing up claimed benefits, the release doesn’t put the paper test in context. While the idea of a “simple” paper test to check for illness may sound novel to the public, paper diagnostic tools have been under development since at least 2007. Some diseases are contagious long before the patient has any symptoms. If a person could be diagnosed as contagious in an asymptomatic stage, then the spread of infection could be slowed or halted. A rapid test allowing patients tested in a clinic to know before they left if they had influenza or a cold, strep or a viral sore throat, would be advantageous because it would allow faster targeted treatments.

269,"### Context: The article criticizes a news release that claims exercise can reverse damage from heart aging. The study mentioned in the news release documented improvements in cardiovascular outcomes commonly seen with regular aerobic exercise, but it did not actually reverse heart aging. The article points out that poor oxygen uptake and loss of heart elasticity are consequences of a sedentary lifestyle, not just aging. The news release also implies that exercise can prevent the risk of future heart failure, even though the study itself states that this outcome is speculative and would require a larger and longer study. The article highlights three limitations of the study that were not mentioned in the news release: the selective recruitment of volunteers who were willing to participate in the intense exercise regimen, the inability to draw conclusions about the impact of exercise on developing heart failure in the future, and the lack of evidence that the improvements in lab values translate to meaningful outcomes for patients. The news release uses the term ""heart aging"" without explanation, which is vague and potentially misleading. The funding sources and conflicts of interest are mentioned in the news release, but no viable alternatives to exercise are discussed. The article concludes that while the study suggests exercise is beneficial, it does not justify the use of the word ""reverse"" or the phrase ""heart aging.""
Claim: Proper exercise can reverse damage from heart aging
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Getty Images This news release describes a small study (~50 subjects) from UT Southwestern Medical Center showing that fairly aggressive and regular exercise in sedentary, middle-aged individuals can marginally increase maximum oxygen uptake and moderately improve the elasticity of the main pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle). Although the news release does a good job outlining the prescribed exercise regime, it makes unwarranted and confusing claims about reversing damage from “heart aging,” and suggesting the findings might “help prevent risk of future heart failure.” This language is not justified. The research can’t tell us if risk for heart failure has been reduced in these study participants. Nor does it establish what is meant by “heart aging” and how that has been “reversed” by the intervention. The news release would have been markedly improved if such terms had been dropped, and focused more on what is — and is not known — about poor fitness as a risk factor for heart failure. Cardiovascular health is a major health issue for middle-aged people and their health care providers. It makes research like this very interesting for readers, and we believe that places a premium on clear language. This study had little to do with “heart aging” or even heart failure. So using such language in both the news release title, as well as the opening paragraph, sets up readers to be misguided and misinformed.",Proper exercise can reverse damage from heart aging,"This news release describes a study of 100 older adults with heart failure who were randomly assigned to either 6 months of aerobic exercise training or to a control group that received health education and counseling. The exercise group had better cardiovascular outcomes, including improved heart function, compared to the control group. The news release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it uses the term “heart aging” without explanation, which is vague and potentially misleading. The release also implies that exercise can prevent the risk of future heart failure, even though the study itself states that this outcome is speculative and would require a larger and longer study. The release also uses the word “reverse” to describe the benefits of exercise, which is a stretch. The news release does a good job of describing the study, but it could have been improved by mentioning the limitations of the study, which the authors themselves point out. The news release also could have been improved by discussing the costs of the exercise program, which were not mentioned."

The image was taken during a COVID-19 anti-lockdown protest in Columbus, Ohio on April 18, 2020. The photograph showed a light-colored minivan with a passenger displaying the sign from the window. The same sign was also seen in another photograph taken during the protest, where two men were outside chatting and one of them held the sign. The authenticity of the image was verified, and it was confirmed that the sign was unaltered and properly described. The anti-Semitic message on the sign overshadowed the various messages of the protest movement against coronavirus restrictions, which included a mix of people adhering to public health guidelines and others who believed the virus was a hoax.

271,"### Context: The article discusses the claims made by Judy Mikovits in the ""Plandemic"" video, which went viral in May 2020. The video presents a conspiracy theory that doctors and experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have silenced dissenting voices and misled the public about the novel coronavirus pandemic. Mikovits is presented as a credible expert voice in the video, and her background is described, including her groundbreaking 1991 doctoral thesis on HIV/AIDS treatment and a controversial article she published in the journal Science in 2009.

The article then goes on to debunk Mikovits' claims by providing additional information about her past. It explains that Mikovits' 2009 paper in Science linked chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) to a retrovirus called XMRV. However, other scientists were unable to replicate her findings, and evidence suggested that her results were due to lab contamination. In 2011, Science retracted the paper, stating that they had lost confidence in its conclusions.

The article also addresses the events surrounding Mikovits' firing from the Whittemore Peterson Institute (WPI) in 2011. She was fired for insubordination after refusing to share a cell line with a former collaborator. After her termination, Mikovits asked a subordinate to remove notebooks and samples from the WPI facility and provide them to her. The subordinate complied, and Mikovits took the materials with her to California and later to Nevada. WPI filed a civil lawsuit against Mikovits to retrieve the stolen property, and she was subsequently arrested on charges of possession of stolen property and unlawful taking of computer data.

The article clarifies that Mikovits' claims of being arrested without a warrant and held in jail without charges are not accurate. She was arrested based on a warrant issued by the University of Nevada at Reno police, and she spent several days in jail before being released on bail. The criminal charges against her were eventually dropped, but WPI obtained an injunction preventing her from distributing the stolen materials and requiring her to return them.

In summary, the article debunks Judy Mikovits' claim that she was arrested without a warrant and jailed without charges for making a controversial scientific discovery. It provides additional information about her past, including the retraction of her 2009 paper and the events surrounding her termination from WPI.

Social media users have been spreading this claim, but it has been debunked by various sources. Newsom's press secretary confirmed that the governor and his family have been in California throughout the pandemic. Montana officials also stated that they are not aware of any recent trips Newsom has made to their state. There are no credible reports or evidence to indicate that Newsom has been to Montana in recent weeks. California law requires Newsom to be within the state's borders to exercise the powers of his office. When he has left California in the past, he has transferred his duties to the lieutenant governor. However, the lieutenant governor's office has not received any notice of Newsom being out of California since early February. Newsom's wife's parents do own a ranch near Stevensville, Montana, but there is no evidence to suggest that Newsom has been vacationing there. Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19 and has recently eased some restrictions based on updated criteria for counties. On May 18, the day the false claim was made, Newsom gave a live press conference from a restaurant in Napa, California. In conclusion, the claim that Newsom was vacationing in Montana is unfounded and has been debunked by multiple sources.

Judge Martha Vazquez has ruled last month that there is no evidence Presbyterian engaged in anti-competitive conduct. Officials say the lawsuit alleges that Presbyterian retaliated against the doctors after it built an oncology clinic in Albuquerque by pressing patients to change doctors and seek care elsewhere among other actions designed to hurt business at the New Mexico Cancer Center. Presbyterian officials have denied the allegations against them. Officials say Presbyterian has the largest health care delivery system in the state and insures hundreds of thousands of state residents.

274,"### Context: The claim that a national four-week quarantine will start on April 1, 2020, affecting the entire population of the United States is false. The rumor of a pending four-week quarantine spread on social media platforms, such as Twitter and Reddit, with some posts citing an ""unknown source"" inside the Pentagon or another agency. The rumor also appeared on Facebook, often accompanied by a Google Docs link or a YouTube video. However, all of these messages originated from a single circulating text or email, not from numerous federal government insiders.

The National Security Council (NSC) addressed and debunked the rumor on Twitter, stating that there was no national lockdown being planned. The NSC advised Americans to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for credible updates on COVID-19.

The rumor of a four-week quarantine caused fear and panic buying among some individuals. The false information attributed to various federal agencies and military branches, as well as to a ""friend of a friend"" (FOAF), creating the impression that the information came from multiple credible sources. However, these attributions were features of the same rumor, added to give a sense of authoritative origin.

The circulating text or email contained a transcript of an audio message, which was also shared as a YouTube video. The message claimed that the US would go on a four-week quarantine, prohibiting people from leaving their homes or engaging in sales transactions. However, the syntax of the message was bizarre, and the YouTube video was actually an audio recording of the text message.

Overall, the claim of a national four-week quarantine starting on April 1, 2020, is false. The rumor originated from a single circulating text or email and was debunked by the NSC. Americans were advised to follow the CDC for credible updates on COVID-19.

This has happened during the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of people typically travel home to visit their families. Public transport networks in surrounding cities have also been shut down. Wuhan's airport is still open, but nearly all flights have been canceled. China's biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, has suspended all services in Wuhan. Highways into and around the city have been closed, and special permission is required to leave. Police are checking incoming vehicles for wild animals, as the virus is believed to have originated from a market in Wuhan that illegally sold wildlife. Some images on social media show crowded hospital corridors, and hospitals have made public appeals for supplies. The government has flown in two planes with 32 tonnes of supplies, mostly medical gear and masks. JD.com Inc, China's second-largest e-commerce firm, is donating one million medical masks and other supplies. Authorities have warned against price-gouging.

Italy is now the worst-affected nation in the world after China, with 1,016 dead and 15,113 confirmed cases since the contagion came to light there on Feb. 21. A team of nine Chinese medical staff arrived late on Thursday with some 30 tonnes of equipment on a flight organized by the Chinese Red Cross. “In this moment of great stress, of great difficulty, we are relieved to have this arrival of supplies. It is true that it will help only temporarily, but it is still important,” said the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca. “We have a desperate need for these masks right now. We need respirators that the Red Cross will donate to the government. This is for sure a really important donation for our country,” Rocca said. The outbreak risks overwhelming Italian hospitals and some key supplies are running low. In contrast to China, Italy’s partners in the European Union earlier this month refused Rome’s requests for help with medical supplies as they looked to stockpile face masks and other equipment to help their own citizens.

The trial was not randomized or blinded, which may introduce biases. The release does not provide any cost information or details about additional testing and radiographic work that would be part of the treatment. Key outcomes such as months of disease-free survival or death rates are also not mentioned. The release mentions that the drug has been licensed for women with ovarian cancer and inherited BRCA mutations, but it does not clarify if the gene testing used in the study is widely available. The release claims that this is the first trial to show the benefit of precision medicine in prostate cancer, although it may be novel for prostate cancer specifically, it is not in the field of oncology in general. The release uses language such as ""pioneering drug,"" ""milestone in cancer treatment,"" ""significant step forward,"" and ""cutting-edge genomic sequencing,"" which may be unjustified. It is important to note that the drug has not been proven to help patients live longer. The researchers involved in the study have multiple ties to pharmaceutical companies, including patents and other commercial interests in the success of these treatments, which should have been disclosed in the release. Overall, the release lacks important information and qualifiers, and potential conflicts of interest are not addressed.
Claim: Landmark clinical trial shows gene-targeted drug can treat prostate cancer
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This small phase ll study looked at responses to the drug olarparib, and its action on a particular type of prostate tumor mutation. While the news release indicates that this is pioneering work in the field of personalized prostate cancer treatment, there is still much to be skeptical about the practice of isolating cancer-related genes with new targeted drugs. The key point not made in the news release is that the study did not demonstrate any mortality or survival benefit in the act of identifying and targeting men with mutated prostate tumors and giving them olarparib. The news release comes across somewhat as a promotional vehicle for genetic testing and yet comparing it with the test for BRAC (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutation would tend to give it a gloss it might not deserve. Without results with this form of  “precision medicine,” hyping genetic testing around this type of metastatic prostate cancer feels a little irresponsible. The final line: “Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families” seems to be putting the cart way before the horse and is likely to confuse and build unreasonable expectations among prostate cancer sufferers. Many men still die from prostate cancer and if there were an easy genetic test that could pinpoint which prostate cancer sufferers were most likely to benefit from a targeted drug therapy this could be a huge advance. The news release presents hype and hope yet one has to refer to the published study to find any real information, where the researchers report: “We cannot yet determine whether olaparib improves overall survival among patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA-repair defects.”",Landmark clinical trial shows gene-targeted drug can treat prostate cancer,"This news release from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in the UK describes a clinical trial that tested a drug called olaparib in men with prostate cancer who have a specific gene mutation. The drug, which is already approved for use in women with ovarian cancer, is thought to be effective in men with this gene mutation because it targets the DNA repair mechanism that allows the cancer to grow. The release claims that this is the first trial to show the benefit of precision medicine in prostate cancer, but it’s not clear that’s true. The release also uses language that may be unjustified, such as “pioneering drug” and “milestone in cancer treatment.” The release also doesn’t provide any quantification of the benefits of the drug, and it doesn’t address the potential conflicts of interest of the researchers involved. The release does a good job of explaining the mechanism of action of the drug, and it provides a good description of the gene mutation that the drug targets.

278,"### Context: The article discusses the alarming statistic that women in the United States today are 50 percent more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes compared to their mothers. This statistic is supported by a post by Neel Shah, a Harvard University professor, who states that in 1990, there were about 17 maternal deaths per 100,000 pregnant women in the US, but by 2015, this number had risen to over 26 deaths per 100,000 pregnant women. The risk of death during childbirth is consistently three to four times higher for black women compared to white women, regardless of income or education.

The article also highlights that many of these deaths occur in the weeks and months before or after birth, rather than during the birthing process itself. This represents a failure of both medical care and social and medical support for mothers. After giving birth, American women are often sent home from the hospital with minimal follow-up care, leaving them to navigate the challenges of motherhood on their own. This lack of support can lead to physical and mental health issues for mothers, as well as disempowerment due to the absence of paid parental leave policies and other social support systems.

The dissatisfaction with maternal care is further highlighted by a study published in the journal Reproductive Health, which found that one in six women reported mistreatment by their healthcare providers during pregnancy and birth, including violations of physical privacy and physical and verbal abuse.

The article also discusses the case of a woman named Judith, who became involved in the ""freebirth"" community online. This community advocates for women to give birth without any involvement from caregivers. Judith's mistrust and negative experiences with medical professionals led her to seek support from online communities. However, when complications arose during her 42nd week of pregnancy, Judith sought medical help, but it was too late to prevent a stillbirth.

The article concludes by highlighting the importance of sharing stories like Judith's to raise awareness and help other women who may be influenced by extreme pregnancy communities. The statistic of increased maternal deaths in the US compared to previous generations serves as a chilling reminder of the need for improved access to healthcare and support for pregnant women and new mothers.

The article explains that a satirical website called Freedom Junkshun published a fabricated claim that a 23-year-old Iranian immigrant named Muhammad Islam was arrested for starting the wildfires. However, this claim is completely false and none of the details mentioned in the article are based on facts. The article also mentions that a right-wing website called Breitbart falsely linked the arrest of Jesus Fabian Gonzalez in Sonoma County, California, with the wildfires. The article claimed that Gonzalez was arrested on suspicion of arson in connection with the wildfires, but Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano refuted these claims in a press conference, stating that there was no indication that Gonzalez was related to the fires. The article also highlights a war of words between the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over Gonzalez's arrest. ICE claimed that Gonzalez was an undocumented immigrant and criticized the sheriff's office for not cooperating with them. However, Sheriff Giordano responded by stating that the detainer request from ICE was unconstitutional and that ICE's press release had caused fear during a major natural disaster. The article concludes by mentioning that blaming certain societal groups for disasters and tragedies is not a new trend, citing historical examples such as the scapegoating of Jews during the Black Death and Jerry Falwell blaming various groups for the 9/11 attacks.

Dewhurst has received endorsements from several officer groups in the past, including the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which named him Texas Crime Fighter of the Year in 2003. The article also mentions that Dewhurst has been a consistent supporter of law enforcement and has volunteered to keynote a ceremony honoring fallen officers. Representatives from law enforcement advocacy groups agree that agencies do not rank officeholders and that they are politically disinterested. They also state that associations or unions may make candidate endorsements, but they do not assign ranks to officeholders unless they are facing each other on the ballot.

283,"### Context: President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Obama administration left him with an empty national stockpile for emergencies. However, this claim is an exaggeration. While the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed shortcomings in the nation's stockpile, it was not completely empty when Trump took office. The stockpile was full of supplies, but not enough to handle the specific demands of the current pandemic.

The stockpile, known as the Strategic National Stockpile, was established to respond to various emergencies such as terrorism attacks, hurricanes, and disease outbreaks. It was short of N95 masks, which were depleted following the 2009 H1N1 outbreak during Obama's tenure. The stockpile was also lacking in funding to invest in new medical countermeasures and replenish expiring products.

The stockpile's director described it as an $8 billion enterprise, with extensive holdings of many needed items. However, it became clear that the stockpile did not have all the supplies needed for the current pandemic. One specific item that was lacking was face masks, which were not substantially replenished after the H1N1 outbreak.

During Obama's presidency, there were budget cuts that affected the stockpile's funding. However, appropriations to the stockpile fluctuated and ended up about where they started. It is difficult to determine the impact of these budget cuts on personal protective equipment (PPE) since the details of the inventory are closely held by federal officials.

Both the Obama and Trump administrations share responsibility for the state of the stockpile. The Trump administration could have taken steps to replenish the stockpile before the current pandemic. The Associated Press found that federal agencies waited until mid-March of this year to begin placing bulk orders for necessary equipment.

In conclusion, while Trump has a point that the stockpile was lacking in certain items like N95 masks, he exaggerated when he described it as a bare cupboard. The stockpile had extensive holdings and funding, but it was not adequately prepared for the demands of the current pandemic. Both the Obama and Trump administrations share responsibility for the state of the stockpile.

284,"### Context: Uralasbest, a Russian mining company and one of the world's largest producers of asbestos, recently showed support for President Trump on their official social media pages. The company posted images of packed asbestos material featuring Trump's face and the text ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States."" Asbestos is a mineral known for its fire-resistant properties but has been linked to various cancers, including lung cancer and mesothelioma.

The non-profit organization Environmental Working Group brought attention to Uralasbest's post and provided an English translation of the accompanying text. The translation stated that Trump supported the head of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who claimed that the agency would no longer address the negative effects of asbestos-containing products. Trump himself referred to asbestos as ""100% safe after application"" in his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback. He also suggested that efforts to regulate asbestos in building construction were part of a mob-led conspiracy.

The images posted by Uralasbest on their official social media accounts are genuine, as is President Trump's support for the asbestos industry. The company's seal with Trump's face and endorsement is a clear indication of their alignment with the President's stance on asbestos.

In summary, a Russian asbestos company, Uralasbest, expressed support for President Trump by placing a seal with his face on their product and claiming it was approved by him. This aligns with Trump's previous statements in which he downplayed the dangers of asbestos and suggested a conspiracy against it.

### Explanation:
",true,"In June, when Uralasbest posted their message of support, then-Administrator of the EPA Scott Pruitt had recently announced new interpretations of the Toxic Substances Control Act that could allow for “new uses” of asbestos to be approved in the United States. While this move would not allow for previously banned uses to be considered, it was a reversal of Obama-era rules that barred the EPA from considering any new uses for asbestos.","A Russian asbestos company placed a seal with the face of President Donald Trump on their product with the note ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.","What's true: A Russian asbestos company posted an image of their product with a seal featuring President Trump's face and the text ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.""

285,"### Context: The claim that Michael Kors uses fur from dogs that were skinned alive in manufacturing their products is not substantiated. A petition hosted on DailyPetition.com alleged that the Michael Kors brand abused dogs and skinned them alive, but there are no archives of this petition. An undercover investigation by PETA into the dog leather industry in China revealed that stray dogs are captured from the streets and sold to unlicensed facilities where they are brutally killed and skinned. The investigator witnessed terrible conditions in these facilities, with dogs kept in tiny, dirty cages without food or water. The dog skins are then processed and sold to fashion companies like Michael Kors. However, a Chinese web site article stated that a DNA test would be needed to determine if the animal products were indeed canine-derived, suggesting that the claim had not been substantiated. PETA's Twitter timeline did not mention products made from dog fur or Michael Kors, indicating that the petition did not originate from that organization. In 2010, PETA criticized Michael Kors for using fur in general, but not specifically dog fur. The provenance of the petition on DailyPetition.com is unknown, and Michael Kors has denied the accusations, stating that their leather products are not made of dog skin.

286,"### Context: The article discusses a study that compared the effectiveness of individualized behavioral therapy and standard educational format for preschoolers with ADHD. The study found that both approaches resulted in about a 30% improvement in learning and problem behaviors, with no difference in outcome between the two. However, the article does not provide an estimate of the absolute improvement or mention any potential harms of behavioral treatment.

The article also raises questions about the costs of these interventions and whether they may detract from the rest of the family or other duties. It suggests that more information about the study's methods and limitations would be helpful, including potential biases and whether the researchers assessing the children were blinded to the intervention each child received.

The article mentions that ADHD may afflict a small portion of preschoolers, but cautions against making early diagnoses too quickly. It also briefly mentions medications as the mainstay treatment for school-age children with ADHD, but fails to note that behavioral therapies have proven to be less effective than medications in this older group.

The article points out that the use of individualized, multifaceted behavioral therapies in preschoolers is relatively new and it is unclear where parents would find this type of therapy. It suggests that more typically, community- or school-based educational programs are provided for school-age children with ADHD.

Overall, the article highlights the need for more information on the costs, potential harms, and limitations of behavioral therapy for preschoolers with ADHD. It also suggests that the study should be placed in the context of other research on behavioral therapy for children with ADHD.
Claim: Easy Nondrug Help Aids ADHD Kids
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Might behavioral therapy help preschoolers diagnosed with ADHD improve their ability to learn and reduce problem behaviors? If it does, is an intensive, customized intervention more helpful than a simpler educational program? This brief article suggests the answers are yes and no. Using a reasonable range of sources, the story nicely sums up the new research and the problems faced by preschoolers with ADHD. The news story says ADHD may afflict a small portion of preschoolers (1% to 4%). But the wide net cast by the story’s diagnostic criteria could ensnare some innocent victims—“extreme symptoms when compared to youngsters of the same age,” including kids who don’t listen, who “drive their families crazy,” and who are injury-prone. Fortunately, a child psychiatrist cautions readers not to “jump on the bandwagon too quickly in making early diagnoses.” Mention of additional criteria–adapted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, for example–might help readers distinguish “extreme” from normal variations in behavior. (New Engl J Med 2005;352:165-73). The story neglects mention of cost or how readers might find professionals to implement the more-intensive program. It might also have provided more context on treatment harms and alternatives. Can behavioral therapy go wrong—and if it can, how might it harm a vulnerable preschooler? The article explains that the main treatment option, medication, is not yet approved for these youngsters. However, it fails to note that behavioral therapies have proven to be less effective as medications in older, school-age kids. (New Engl J Med 2005;352:165-73).",Easy Nondrug Help Aids ADHD Kids,"This is a story about a study of preschoolers with ADHD who were given either individualized, multifaceted behavioral therapy or standard educational format.

287,"### Context: The claim states that the 1866 legal precedent, Ex parte Milligan, prohibits governments from using a state of emergency, such as a pandemic, as a reason to restrict individuals' rights to travel or earn a living. However, the article refutes this claim by explaining that the Milligan case is not relevant to the issue of imposing temporary restrictions during emergencies like pandemics.

Ex parte Milligan was a Civil War-era case involving an Indiana resident named Lambdin P. Milligan. He was arrested in 1864 by order of a military commander, tried by a military commission, and sentenced to death. Milligan argued that as a civilian not serving in the military, he should not be subject to military tribunals while civil courts were still functioning. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Milligan, ruling that it was unconstitutional to try civilians in military tribunals when civil courts and authority were still operational.

The article emphasizes that the Milligan case does not have any real relevance to the issue of imposing temporary restrictions on movement, travel, and business operations during emergencies like pandemics. The case specifically dealt with the jurisdiction of military tribunals over civilians during a time of war.

Furthermore, the quoted material in the social media post, which refers to ""Section 98"" and the U.S. having 50 states, is not part of the Milligan decision or any valid court ruling or law. The source of the cited ""Section 98"" remains unknown.

The article also highlights that states have historically used their police powers to protect public health and safety, including enforcing isolation and quarantine measures. Legal rulings such as Jacobsen v. Massachusetts in 1905 have upheld the right of state legislatures to pass laws mandating the use of vaccines to protect public health. As long as these regulations do not conflict with federal constitutional authority, states have the power to enact reasonable regulations to safeguard public health and safety.

In summary, the claim that the 1866 Ex parte Milligan case precludes states from enforcing regulations that restrict residents' freedom to travel or earn a living during emergencies like pandemics is incorrect. The Milligan case is unrelated to the issue of temporary restrictions during emergencies, and states have historically used their police powers to protect public health and safety.

288,"### Context: The claim that NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming is not supported by the evidence. The article explains that records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on new data, statistical analyses, and historical insight. These changes are publicly reported, peer-reviewed, and based on scientific criteria.

The article highlights that the ""smoking gun"" in this conspiracy theory concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). The GISTEMP record is based on a global dataset of temperature stations and provides a measure of changing global surface temperature since 1880. The article points out that the data shifted following 1999, but this was not evidence of faked data. NASA published papers in 1999 and 2001 explaining the changes and summarizing them on their website.

The need for adjustments to climate datasets is explained by Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather. He argues that there is no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the US have been moved multiple times, instruments have changed, and observation times have shifted. Adjustments are made to remove non-climatic biases from the dataset, not to fit a ""climate change narrative.""

The article also mentions that the issues described above are largely moot at the time of writing in 2019. The GISTEMP v3 dataset, which was the focus of the conspiracy theory, has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4. The adjustments made to the dataset served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to earlier records.

In conclusion, the claim that NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming is unfounded. The changes in the dataset were based on scientific criteria, publicly reported, and peer-reviewed. The adjustments were made to remove non-climatic biases and improve the accuracy of the temperature record.
Claim: NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming. 
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"To suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming. ,"What's true: A 2007 paper by NOAA's James Hansen and colleagues used a different method to calculate global surface temperatures, resulting in a slightly different dataset than the GISTEMP v3 record. What's false: The 2007 paper was not evidence of a """"climate gate"""" cover-up, and the 2014 paper by Foster and Rahmstorf was not evidence of a """"climate gate"""" cover-up."
289,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that pregnant women from Mexico and other countries come to the United States to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. Critics of illegal immigration refer to these children as ""anchor babies"" because they are seen as a way for parents and relatives to obtain citizenship and benefits. Several Republican senators have called for hearings on whether the 14th Amendment, which grants birthright citizenship, needs to be rewritten. Senator Lindsey Graham proposed amending the Constitution to clarify that babies born in the U.S. do not automatically receive American citizenship.

The article examines the benefits that having a citizen child can provide for undocumented parents. While having an ""anchor baby"" does not help a Mexican mother become a U.S. citizen, it can provide short-term benefits such as eligibility for certain programs like Women-Infants-Children (WIC) and Medicaid for the child. Having a child can also help an undocumented parent qualify for relief from deportation, but the chances are slim. Most of the benefits of citizenship accrue over the long term, such as the ability to work legally and qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges.

The article presents mixed evidence regarding the claim that many women come to the U.S. solely to give birth and then leave. While there are news accounts of undocumented immigrants giving birth in the U.S., data and surveys do not support the notion that many women are illegally crossing the border for this purpose. Immigration from Mexico tends to fluctuate with the health of the economy, suggesting that people come to the U.S. primarily for work. Additionally, there is no evidence of a higher percentage of women of child-bearing age among undocumented immigrants compared to men.

The article also highlights the distinction between affluent ""birth tourists"" who come to the U.S. legally and give birth, and illegal immigrants who are not engaging in ""drop and leave"" behavior. The author argues that conflating these two groups exaggerates the alleged problem and uses inflammatory rhetoric to obscure legitimate policy questions.

Overall, the article challenges the claim that many women come to the U.S. solely to give birth and secure citizenship for their children. While there are cases of undocumented immigrants giving birth in the U.S., the evidence suggests that the primary motivator for illegal immigration is the search for work and economic opportunities.

290,"### Context: The article discusses the recent FDA approval of Bayer's Kyleena, a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, for the prevention of pregnancy for up to five years. However, the article highlights several important aspects that are missing from the release.

Firstly, the article points out that the release does not mention the cost of Kyleena, which is odd considering it was issued by the manufacturer. The article mentions that a similar product marketed by Bayer, called Mirena, costs around $700 or $800, excluding any medical fees. It is also unclear whether Kyleena may be covered by insurance plans.

The release provides information on the rate of unexpected pregnancies among patients using Kyleena, citing the Pearl Index as a standard metric for evaluating contraceptive effectiveness. The effectiveness of Kyleena is stated as 1.45 pregnancies per 100 women over 5 years of use, which is compared to other levonorgestrel products with higher amounts of active hormone and slightly better effectiveness. However, there is no data on Kyleena's effects on reducing menstrual bleeding, flow, and cramps, which is a benefit of higher-dose levonorgestrel IUDs.

The article criticizes the release for not comparing Kyleena to other birth control methods or addressing the likelihood of potential side effects compared to other products on the market. It also mentions that the release does not mention whether the clinical trial had a control group, which is an important point for putting adverse effects into context.

The article highlights that the release fails to clearly describe how Kyleena differs from Mirena and other levonorgestrel-releasing devices/implants on the market. It also states that the release does not compare the efficacy of Kyleena to the broader suite of birth control options available, which is a significant oversight.

In conclusion, the article points out several important aspects that are missing from the release, including cost, comparisons to other products, and information on side effects. It suggests that potential users should be able to clearly compare the costs, risks, and benefits of Kyleena to existing products.
Claim: FDA Approves Bayer's Kyleena™ (Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System) 19.5 mg for Prevention of Pregnancy for up to Five Years
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The news release focuses on a forthcoming birth control product called Kyleena. The product is implanted in the uterus and releases the hormone levonorgestrel, which the release says can prevent pregnancy for up to five years. The release does a fair job of describing the clinical trial that led to FDA’s approval of Kyleena, and also addresses potential side effects associated with the product. However, the release does not address cost at all. The release also fails to discuss similar alternatives that are already on the market, or even offer any information comparing the effectiveness of Kyleena relative to other forms of birth control. [Editor’s note: Bayer makes a number of IUD contraceptive devices including Mirena and a permanent contraceptive called Essure. This release stacks up favorably to a Bayer news release on Essure which we also reviewed (and discussed in a blog post) in terms of discussing harms, quantified benefits and quality of evidence. However, neither release addressed costs.] According to the CDC, more than 7 percent of U.S. women use long-term, reversible contraceptives — i.e., intrauterine systems or implants — to avoid unwanted pregnancy. The widespread use of these technologies means that they are both economically important and — more importantly — that such birth control systems have a significant impact on the health and well-being of millions of women. As such, it is newsworthy when new products receive FDA approval and come to market. But in order for potential users — and their healthcare providers — to make sense of a new product, they need some basic information. For example, they need to know how the new product compares to existing products on the market — and how much they will cost. This release falls short on both of those fronts.",FDA Approves Bayer's Kyleena™ (Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System) 19.5 mg for Prevention of Pregnancy for up to Five Years,"This news release from Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. announces FDA approval of Kyleena, a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) for the prevention of pregnancy for up to five years.

291,"### Context: The article refutes the claim made by Fox Business host John Stossel that there is no good data showing that secondhand smoke kills people. The article states that there is plenty of scientific research and consensus that secondhand smoke does indeed kill people. Secondhand smoke is considered a cancer-causing agent and a known human carcinogen. The U.S. government has campaigned for tough anti-smoking policies in public places and workplaces to protect Americans from secondhand smoke. Reports from the country's top doctors indicate that these laws are reducing the risk of secondhand smoke-related diseases. The U.S. surgeon general has released multiple reports since 1964 that summarize the latest research on smoking and its effects, and these reports have been peer-reviewed by top scientists. The surgeon general's reports state that inhaling secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults. Involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke also poses significant problems for children, worsening asthma and leading to other respiratory conditions. Since 1964, 2.46 million non-smokers have died from exposure to secondhand smoke. The government calculates these numbers using statistical methods used by epidemiologists, who analyze individual risk of disease next to the proportion of people exposed to secondhand smoke. Major scientific organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Cancer Society, and the National Academy of Sciences also link secondhand smoke with deadly diseases. While there may be some debate over specific numbers, the evidence is firm and powerful that secondhand smoke kills. Some scientists even argue that the government is undercounting secondhand smoke-related deaths. Overall, the claim made by John Stossel that there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people is refuted by the scientific consensus and research on the topic.

292,"### Context: A recent study conducted by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life project found that the number of caregivers in the United States has increased by 10% between 2010 and 2013. The study surveyed 3,014 adults nationwide and discovered that most caregivers were between the ages of 30 and 64. The slow U.S. economy may be a contributing factor to the rise in family members taking on caregiving responsibilities, as people are less able to afford professional help due to depleted savings. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about half of the U.S. population has at least one chronic condition, and adults aged 65 and older, who are expected to make up 19% of the population by 2030, are particularly prone to chronic conditions. As chronic illnesses progress, family members often step in to provide care due to their better understanding of the disease's progression. Many caregivers become ""voracious information consumers"" and regularly seek online resources to help them care for their family members or cope with the stress of caregiving. A previous Pew Research Study found that nearly half of adults surveyed expect to care for an elderly parent or relative at some point in their lives. The lead author of the study, Susannah Fox, predicts that the number of caregivers will continue to increase in the future.

The study followed 435 individuals who were all 70 years of age or older and had known carotid stenosis. The article mentions that the results of this study are not generalizable to individuals without this condition.

The article highlights that the story did not discuss the costs associated with these ultrasound methods, which is an important aspect to consider. It also mentions that the story correctly emphasized that the benefit of surgery increases with increasing risk. However, it criticizes the article for not providing specific numbers to help readers understand the risks associated with the intervention resulting from the tests.

The article points out that the story reported the likelihood of individuals with certain ultrasound visualizations having a stroke but did not provide the actual increase in stroke observed. This information is crucial for understanding the magnitude of the benefit possible. Additionally, the article mentions that the story included quotes from clinicians indicating that the risk of stroke is higher with carotid endarterectomy, but it did not provide any numbers to help readers understand the risks associated with the intervention.

The article also notes that the story could have done a better job of explaining early on that the study participants were all 70 years of age or older and had known carotid stenosis. It emphasizes that the results of the study should not be generalized to individuals without this condition.

Furthermore, the article mentions that the story did not clarify whether the ultrasound methods used in the study were new or widely known and available. It questions whether these methods are currently in use for other applications or if they are typically used in combination as in the study.

294,"### Context: The claim that you can be fined $999 and have your license suspended for holding a cell phone in your car as of January 2019 is false. The article states that there is no firm or speculative information about a law of that type being proposed or implemented in January 2019. In March 2018, a similar rumor was circulating in Florida, but it was found to be false. The DMV Florida website states that while cell phones are considered a distraction and can result in a ticket for reckless or distracted driving, there is no specific law about holding a cell phone while driving.

There have been laws proposed or rumored in specific states. In Georgia, it is illegal to hold a phone while driving, and those caught breaking the rules face a $50 fine. In South Carolina, a proposed law would carry fines of $100 and $300 for first and subsequent offenses, not $999. In Ontario, Canada, a distracted driving law took effect in January 2019, but the fine and suspension table provided does not match the claims in the post.

The article also mentions a law in California that went into effect in 2017, which prohibits driving while holding and operating a phone or electronic communication device. However, the fine for this offense is around $150, not $999.

Overall, there is no evidence to support the claim that you can be fined $999 and have your license suspended for holding a cell phone in your car as of January 2019.

295,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by the Drug Policy Alliance that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz repeatedly voted to send terminally ill patients to prison. The claim stems from Wasserman Schultz's opposition to Florida's medical marijuana ballot initiative and her vote against a congressional amendment that banned the use of federal money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws.

The article explains that Wasserman Schultz's opposition to the medical marijuana ballot initiative was due to concerns about the broad language of the initiative and the lack of strong regulatory oversight from state officials. The Drug Policy Alliance argues that the initiative would have protected patients using medical marijuana.

Regarding her vote against the congressional amendment, Wasserman Schultz stated that she didn't want to limit the executive branch's ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion. The amendment aimed to prevent federal agents from raiding retail operations in states where medical marijuana is legal. Wasserman Schultz was one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment.

The article also addresses the claim that Wasserman Schultz's votes mean she repeatedly voted to send terminally ill patients to prison. It explains that even before her 2014 congressional votes, the federal government had already shifted its focus away from individuals who simply use marijuana for medical needs. The Justice Department issued a memorandum in 2013 instructing federal attorneys to focus on cartels and criminal organizations, allowing state and local agencies to address marijuana activity through their own narcotics laws.

Law professors interviewed for the article confirm that the federal government does not prioritize prosecuting individuals who use marijuana for medical purposes. While the amendment passed in 2014 may constrain federal prosecution of medical marijuana suppliers in states where their activities are legal, there are still cases where individuals are prosecuted.

In conclusion, the article states that the claim made by the Drug Policy Alliance significantly exaggerates the issue. While Wasserman Schultz did vote against amendments related to medical marijuana, the federal government does not send terminally ill patients to prison for using marijuana. The focus of federal enforcement has been on major suppliers and distributors, rather than individual users.
Claim: Drug Policy Alliance Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Wasserman Schultz ""voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison,"" Piper said. She voted against amendments to ban the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. In theory, advocates believe that the amendment -- which passed late in 2014 after multiple attempts -- prevents the feds from going after sick marijuana users in states that allow medical marijuana. However, even before the amendment passed, dying patients who simply smoked joints that they obtained legally were not being hauled off to prison en masse by federal agents. Instead, the federal government focused on major suppliers or distributors. Saying Wasserman Schultz voted to send people to prison significantly exaggerates the issue. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.","Drug Policy Alliance Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison.","The Drug Policy Alliance said that Wasserman Schultz """"voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison."""" That’s a significant exaggeration of the issue. Wasserman Schultz did vote against amendments to bills that would have affected medical marijuana, but the federal government is not sending terminally ill patients to prison for using marijuana."
296,"### Context: The article discusses a conspiracy theory that spread on social media claiming that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ordered that all deaths in the United States be attributed to COVID-19, regardless of the true cause. The theory suggests that COVID-19 tests have an 80% false positive rate and that deaths unrelated to the virus are being counted in the death toll. The theory also claims that the CDC is manipulating the death numbers to intentionally harm the economy and the sitting president.

The article then goes on to analyze the claims made in the conspiracy theory. It mentions that variations of the rumor appeared on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, often linking to blog posts that attributed the CDC's alleged manipulation of the death toll to a conspiracy aimed at destroying the American economy. However, the article points out that these conspiracy theories are not consistent or congruent.

The article then focuses on a speech by Dr. Annie Bukacek, a Montana-based physician, who claimed that the CDC is exaggerating the COVID-19 death toll by manipulating death certificates. She argues that death certificates are often based on assumptions and educated guesses, and that there is no universal definition of a COVID-19 death. She references a memo from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) that introduced a new ICD code for COVID-19 deaths on death certificates. However, the article clarifies that the memo was about accurately capturing mortality data for COVID-19 and ensuring that all contributing cases of COVID-19 were captured. It did not instruct medical professionals to classify all deaths as COVID-19.

The article also mentions that the CDC's website provides provisional death counts for COVID-19, which include both confirmed and presumptive positive cases. It explains that deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, but that increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality.

In summary, the article debunks the conspiracy theory that the CDC is ordering all deaths to be counted as COVID-19 deaths. It clarifies that the CDC's guidelines aim to accurately capture mortality data for COVID-19 and that deaths are not being falsely attributed to the virus.
Claim: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is ordering that all deaths no matter the cause be counted as COVID-19 deaths via a new ICD code.

297,"### Context: The article examines two claims made by Republican strategist Ed Gillespie regarding the economic performance under President George W. Bush. Gillespie claimed that there were 52 months of uninterrupted job creation and that revenues were at an all-time high in 2007. 

Regarding the claim of uninterrupted job creation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. However, there were two months during that period where jobs were lost. Therefore, Gillespie's claim of uninterrupted job creation is slightly inaccurate. It should be noted that over the course of Bush's presidency, the economy created 1.08 million jobs, which is the lowest average annual percentage increase compared to other post-World War II presidents prior to Obama.

Regarding the claim of all-time high revenues in 2007, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center confirms that total federal tax receipts reached $2.57 trillion in 2007, the highest recorded since 1934. However, this statistic neglects the size of the economy as a whole. When considering the size of the economy, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP in 2007, which is high but not a record. It only ranks 16th place since 1934 and 7th place within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009.

In conclusion, Gillespie's claims are generally accurate but lack some historical context. While there were not 52 months of uninterrupted job creation under Bush, there were 50 months. Additionally, while revenues were at an all-time high in 2007, this was aided by the size of the non-recession economy.

298,"### Context: The article discusses the mixed reviews and controversies surrounding the drug known as ""female Viagra"" or flibanserin. The author criticizes the lack of cost information provided in the article and questions the significance of the reported increase in ""satisfying sexual events"" for women using the drug. The article also highlights the unbalanced focus on anecdotal evidence and the absence of information about the known side effects of the drug, such as fainting, falls, and somnolence. The author argues that a systematic review, which is considered the highest form of evidence, should have been included to provide a more comprehensive analysis. The article mentions a conflicted clinician with ties to pharmaceutical companies who criticizes the study's conclusions, but the author argues that a plausible explanation for the criticism should be provided. The author suggests that the pharmaceutical industry may have a vested interest in medicalizing and hyping a condition that may not require medical treatment. The article also points out the financial support provided by the drug manufacturer to those attending the FDA hearings on flibanserin. The author notes that the drug has never been tested against a more holistic approach that considers the complexity of female sexuality and addresses physical, psychological, and social factors. Finally, the article acknowledges that the drug has been on the market since October 2015 and highlights the presence of certain individuals, such as Dr. Lauren Streicher and patient Jodi Cole, who appear in multiple stories on this study. Overall, the article suggests that there are controversies and conflicts of interest surrounding the drug and calls for a more balanced and comprehensive analysis of its effectiveness and potential side effects.
Claim: 'Female Viagra' gets mixed reviews
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story reports the results of a review of the new drug for female sexual dysfunction, flibanserin (Addyi). This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis studying the impact of flibanserin in women with HSDD. The CNN coverage of this large and exhaustive study had many shortcomings starting with the headline. It is hardly a ‘mixed’ review when you compare a weighty study that found very marginal effects of the drug in nearly 6,000 women, and put that up against a single compelling anecdote of a women who says her life was turned around by the drug. It’s also questionable to give so much weight to the comments of a clinician with known ties to pharmaceutical companies that make drugs for female sexual problems (and without disclosing those relationships). This is an important piece of reporting because how a new drug performs in clinical studies on thousands of patients has a direct relevance to the women who would be encouraged to take the drug and the physicians who would want to prescribe it. Journalists need to be ultra cautious in reporting on such a ‘sexy’ topic and carefully weigh the comments of clinicians and patients who provide what seem to be ‘market-tested’ testimonials. Almost everything about the marketing and medicalization of female sexual dysfunction is controversial: the article acknowledges that controversy, but barely. Most thoughtful clinicians in this area see the problem as a multifactorial one, which may be affected by physiological changes, psychological issues, relationship factors, and/or cultural context. Any journalist weighing in on this subject must, even briefly, step back and ask: Given all these controversies, how can this study be covered in a way that readers, especially women, aren’t misled?",'Female Viagra' gets mixed reviews,"This story is about a drug called flibanserin, which is marketed as a “female Viagra.” The story reports on a recent study that found the drug was no more effective than a placebo in increasing “sexual desire” in pre-menopausal women. The story does a good job of describing the study and the drug, but it falls short in several other areas. The story should have mentioned the cost of the drug, which is $190 per month. The story should have also mentioned that the study was funded by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug. The story should have mentioned that the study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which is one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world.

299,"### Context: A recent study has found that taking aspirin daily can reduce the risk of dying from cancer. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, analyzed data from several old trials and used death records to allow for a longer follow-up. The study found that patients who took aspirin had a 23% reduction in cancer deaths compared to those who took a placebo. However, it is important to note that the absolute reduction in cancer deaths was only 0.7%. This means that 150 people would need to be treated with aspirin to prevent one death from cancer. The study also found that taking aspirin daily can increase the risk of bleeding ulcers and other adverse events.

The article points out that the cost of daily aspirin intake is low and well-known, so it does not discuss the cost in detail. However, it mentions that if a recommendation were made for everyone to start taking aspirin daily at age 45, the national price tag would be substantial. The article also criticizes the study for not adequately quantifying the potential benefits of aspirin. It argues that the story relies too heavily on the relative differences between the aspirin group and the placebo group, without considering the small number of deaths in both groups for some of the cancers studied.

The article praises the study for being based on randomized controlled trials, but notes that the trials investigated aspirin's effects on heart disease, not cancer. It also highlights the limitations of using old trial data and the potential pitfalls of repurposing scientific data. The article argues that readers should have been cautioned about these limitations.

The article quotes experts who urge caution and warn about the potential risks of taking aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding in the brain. It also mentions that some of the authors of the study have consulting relationships with pharmaceutical companies.

Overall, the article argues that the potential cancer prevention benefits of aspirin seen in the study are inflated and that alternative ways of reducing cancer risk, such as avoiding smoking and obesity, should be considered. It concludes by stating that while the study establishes the novelty of using aspirin as a cancer prevention measure, it is premature to recommend aspirin specifically for cancer prevention.
Claim: Aspirin Helps in Reducing Cancer Deaths, a Study Finds
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Compared to other stories we reviewed on a study ofthe potential benefits of aspirin for reducing cancer, this one presented an optimistic take on the potential benefits of daily aspirin and provided few caveats. Unlike the NPR Shots story, it failed to quantify the harms, and unlike the WebMD story, it failed to define the scope of cancer deaths. The study itself nicely states the reason cautious reporting on new cancer treatments matters. “In the developed world, the lifetime risk of cancer is about 40%, and rates are increasing in the developing world. In Europe, about 3.2 million new cancers present each year, with about 1·7 million deaths, and there are more than 1.5 million new cases each year in the USA. By contrast with treatment of cancer, there has been little progress in use of drugs in prevention of the disease.” Whether aspirin proves to be a preventative drug remains to be seen, and stories about aspirin for cancer prevention need to provide the right context for readers to know how to make important choices about their health.","Aspirin Helps in Reducing Cancer Deaths, a Study Finds","The story reports on a study that found daily aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of dying from cancer. The story does a good job of describing the potential harms of aspirin use, and rightly notes that the study is not conclusive. However, the story should have done a better job of quantifying the potential benefits of aspirin use, and it should have been more clear about the limitations of the study. The study is based on data from trials that were originally designed to study the effects of aspirin on heart disease, not cancer. The study also used data from trials that were not designed to study the effects of aspirin on cancer, and the trials were not long enough to study the effects of aspirin on the development of cancer. The study used a statistical technique to allow for a longer follow-up, but this technique has its limitations. The story should have been more clear about these limitations."
300,"### Context: A newly identified form of vertigo has been discovered by researchers, according to a news article. The article mentions that this form of vertigo can be treated with an unnamed medication, but fails to provide the name of the medication or its cost. The article does mention that one-third of the 20 patients with this new form of vertigo appeared to benefit from the medication. However, it is important to note that these patients only make up 10 percent of those recruited in the study, and only two percent of the total recruited were successfully treated by the medication.

The article focuses on the diagnosis of this new form of vertigo, but does not provide clear information on the benefits of the treatment or the quality of the evidence behind the diagnosis. It also does not provide any counter-balance to the viewpoint that this is a new diagnosis. The article only includes one source, a member of the research team, and does not disclose who funded the study.

The mechanism for diagnosing this new form of vertigo involves using audio-visual equipment to record eye movements. The article mentions that there is not enough information to fully inform the reader about the availability of getting screened for this type of vertigo or how to treat it.

The article seems to heavily rely on information from a news release, as it includes a quote directly from an American Academy of Neurology news release without attribution. The article also appears to have borrowed several descriptions from the news release with limited rewriting.

In conclusion, the article discusses a newly identified form of vertigo that can be treated with an unnamed medication. However, it fails to provide important information such as the name and cost of the medication, as well as clear information on the benefits and quality of the evidence behind the diagnosis and treatment. The article also lacks independent sources and does not disclose who funded the study.

With no independent sources, it doesn’t critically explore the question of whether this is really a new diagnosis, or only a subgroup of vertigo patients who had a particular finding on a special examination. People suffering from vertigo can have symptoms ranging from miserable to completely debilitating. And since vertigo can have various causes, treatments can vary, as can their effectiveness.

301,"### Context: The article discusses the recommendation by a panel for all adult smokers to receive the pneumonia vaccine. The original Associated Press (AP) story mentioned the cost of the vaccine, which was $30, and questioned the cost effectiveness of vaccinating younger, otherwise healthy college-age smokers. However, these points were cut out in the version published by the NY Daily News. The article also fails to mention the number of adult smokers under age 65 who would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of pneumonia, as there was little data on this point in the source material. The original AP story also mentioned that the vaccine may not be very effective and could be considered overtreatment in otherwise healthy younger smokers, but this part was cut out in the NY Daily News version. Neither version of the article mentioned potential side effects of the vaccine, such as pain if administered via the muscle or allergic reactions, although these are rare. The article does not provide any quantitative evidence on which the new vaccination recommendations were based, and it fails to note the lack of evidence or question experts on this point. However, it does mention that smokers are four times more likely to develop pneumonia than non-smokers of the same age. The article could have included better sources, as the original AP story had two sources quoted, one from the CDC and another independent source, but the NY Daily News version cut out the independent source interview. The article also does not mention how smoking cessation counseling will be administered with the vaccine. It mentions deaths from pneumonia in those over 65 but does not provide information on how pneumonia is typically treated in this population or in younger people, or in smokers specifically. The article does not clarify the uncertainty surrounding the number of smokers that need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of invasive infection or how many cases will be prevented by adopting this new strategy. It does mention that the vaccination is already in use for people over age 65 and that recommended pneumonia vaccinations in older adults and those with compromised immune and respiratory systems are not new. The focus of the article is on the new recommendations for all adult smokers to be vaccinated, but it is unclear if the story relied solely or largely on a news release.
Claim: Panel recommends pneumonia vaccine for adult smokers
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The NY Daily News took a 750-word Associated Press story and chopped it down to 230 words. It lost much of the important meat in this cut – all to save 500 words. Our comments target this butchered Daily News version. The Daily News version cut out these important elements of the original AP story:   cost and cost-effectiveness questions; concerns that the new vaccinations may be considered overtreatment in otherwise healthy younger smokers; the only interview with an independent source; any discussion of the inefficacy of the vaccine in younger people or of the fact that there is no booster available, even though protection drops off after 5-10 years. The chief deficiencies of either version of the article are that the reader is left without a sense of how effective the vaccine might be in the newly-targeted populations. The article could have been improved with an attempt at quantification of benefits or numbers needed to vaccinate as well as with richer interviews of more disinterested experts who could have filled in these areas. Some vague areas in the article are misleading: the vaccine does not in the best of circumstances prevent lung infection; pneumococcal infection is not synonymous with ""pneumonia;""  the vaccine may have no ""booster"" but revaccination is a common practice; and not all smokers are alike, making it unlikely that the CDC would recommend the vaccination indiscriminately. After reading the article, the reader should be left wondering what the health benefit might be of this strategy, but fairly confident that more vaccine will be sold and administered. And readers of the shortened NY Daily News article  got even less. If 230 words is all you can invest in a story like this, you might as well give up the space to the comics section or Sudoku.",Panel recommends pneumonia vaccine for adult smokers,"The New York Daily News version of this story is a cut-down version of the original Associated Press story.

The article states that Mueller was taken captive by the Islamic State in 2013 while working with humanitarian organizations in Syria. False claims emerged after her death suggesting that she supported Palestinian terrorist groups. The International Solidarity Movement (ISM) confirmed that Mueller volunteered with them for two months in 2010, but the email's characterization of ISM as a terrorist group is false. The ISM is a Palestinian-led movement committed to non-violent resistance against the oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian population. Mueller participated in nonviolent protests and accompanied children to school during her time with the ISM. Her involvement was kept secret during her captivity for her safety. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response to Mueller's death also contradicts the claim, as he expressed condolences and solidarity with the American people. After her time with the ISM, Mueller volunteered with other humanitarian organizations, including an HIV/AIDS clinic in Arizona. She later worked with Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council to help refugees on the Turkey-Syria border. The article concludes that the claim that Mueller ""deserves no tears"" because of her involvement with a nonviolent Palestinian group is baseless.

303,"### Context: In an opinion piece in the Washington Post, state Sen. Wendy Davis claimed that each year, about 25,000 American women become pregnant through rape or incest. Davis cited a fact sheet from NARAL Pro Choice America, which stated that approximately 25,000 women in the United States become pregnant as a result of rape. However, there are no statistics on incest pregnancies in the fact sheet or other sources. Dean Kilpatrick, director of the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center, explained that there is little research on incest due to underreporting. 

Davis' spokesperson provided two articles on rape-related pregnancy. A 1996 analysis of the National Women's Study estimated that 5 percent of rapes resulted in pregnancies, leading to an estimate of 32,101 rape-related pregnancies annually among American women older than 18 years. A 2000 article in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine used the same 5 percent pregnancy rate and estimated 25,000 pregnancies from rape in 1998. The fact sheet from NARAL Pro Choice America attributes its 25,000 figure to the 2000 article.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Justice do not keep data on pregnancy due to rape. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers the 32,000 figure from the 1996 analysis as the best estimate. However, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) reached a much lower figure of 3,204 pregnancies a year from rape by using the 5 percent pregnancy rate and the Justice Department's 2005 National Crime Victimization Survey.

Federal statistics show that rapes have declined significantly in the U.S. since the 1990s. A 2013 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed a 65 percent drop in completed rapes from 1995 to 2010. Kilpatrick disagreed with the federal survey's results, estimating higher numbers of rapes in his studies. He argued that the percentage of women raped has not changed significantly since the 1990s.

Using different data sources and calculations, estimates of rape-related pregnancies per year range from 3,200 to 50,000. Davis' claim falls within this range, but there is too much disagreement to determine a definitive number.

305,"### Context: Spain has now surpassed Italy in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with a total of 117,710 cases. However, Spain's death toll of 10,935 is still second to Italy's 13,915 fatalities. On a positive note, the number of deaths in Spain fell from 950 to 932 on Friday, marking the first decrease in over a week. The deputy head of health emergency, Maria Jose Rallo, stated that the increase in cases is now at 7%, down from 20% a week ago, indicating a reduction trend.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has implemented one of Europe's strictest lockdowns in Spain. Only employees in essential sectors, such as healthcare, are allowed to travel to and from work. Restaurants, bars, and shops are closed, and social gatherings are prohibited. Spaniards have been under home confinement since March 14, with the lockdown initially set to last for 15 days but now extended until April 12. The government is considering a second extension of the lockdown.

The lockdown measures have severely impacted businesses in Spain. Fashion retailer Inditex's logistic centers, which are crucial to its global retail operations, are operating at minimum activity. Santander, Spain's largest bank, has raised its lending capacity to 90 billion euros ($97 billion) after canceling its dividend. Banks are also dealing with a high number of requests for mortgage holidays.

The healthcare system in Spain is under immense pressure. Mortuaries are overwhelmed, leading regional authorities to set up a third improvised facility at an ice rink near Madrid to accommodate the increasing number of corpses. Field hospitals have been established in various locations around the country to treat patients. The Catalan region, the most populous in Spain, is the second worst-hit after Madrid, with over 4,400 deaths reported.

Overall, Spain's coronavirus cases have surpassed Italy's, but the death rate has shown signs of slowing down. The strict lockdown measures have frozen businesses and put significant strain on the healthcare system. The government is considering extending the lockdown, and various measures are being taken to address the increasing number of cases and deaths.

306,"### Context: The claim that women's menstrual cycles synchronize when they live or work in close proximity to one another is widely believed but lacks scientific evidence. The idea originated from a 1971 study conducted on college students at an all-female college, which found increased synchronization between roommates and close friends. This phenomenon, known as socially mediated synchrony, has been explained by evolutionary theories suggesting that synchrony maximizes reproductive success by minimizing the risk of being monopolized by a dominant male.

However, subsequent studies have called into question the existence of menstrual synchrony. A 2006 study found no evidence of synchrony among women living in pairs or triples, and another study in the same year failed to replicate the results of the 1971 study. Mathematical critiques argue that perceived synchrony may occur by chance or through biased data analysis.

Furthermore, no evidence of menstrual synchrony has been found in unindustrialized, natural fertility populations, such as the Dogon hunter-gatherer society in Mali. This challenges the evolutionary explanations for synchrony, as these populations represent the conditions under which human reproductivity evolved.

A recent pilot study conducted by the period-tracking app ""Clue"" and Oxford anthropologist Alex Alvergne analyzed data from over 1,500 users and found no evidence of synchrony. Out of 360 pairs with at least three cycles, 273 pairs had a larger difference in cycle start dates at the end of the study than at the beginning.

Overall, the belief in menstrual synchrony is widespread but lacks empirical support. It is suggested that the belief may arise from a popular misconception about the expected proximity of menstrual onsets by chance alone. While the idea of menstrual synchrony may have psychological appeal, the scientific evidence does not support its existence.

307,"### Context: A study has found that taking fatty acid supplements can help ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The study, published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, involved 120 women who were randomly assigned to take either a placebo or a supplement containing a combination of fatty acids for six months. The women who took the supplement reported a significant reduction in PMS symptoms compared to those who took the placebo. The researchers believe that the fatty acids may help regulate the production of certain chemicals in the brain that are associated with PMS symptoms. The study also found that the supplement was well-tolerated, with few side effects reported. However, the article does not provide specific details about the side effects or the symptoms that improved. The article also does not mention the cost of the supplements, which is an important consideration for many people. Additionally, the article does not evaluate the quality of the evidence or include any independent expert opinions. It also does not mention any conflicts of interest that the scientists involved in the study may have. The article briefly mentions other supplements that have been studied for PMS, but fails to note that there are also prescription medications available for PMS, such as SSRIs. Overall, the article provides limited information and does not fully address the potential tradeoffs and considerations for women considering using fatty acid supplements for PMS.
Claim: Study: Fatty acids can help ease PMS symptoms
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The story didn’t even report which symptoms improved, or even a list of what was being measured. There are so many symptoms associated with PMS — ranging from physical to behavioral — that it’s important to know which symptoms they are talking about. Studies of PMS are notorious for showing a strong placebo effect, but we can’t tell whether taking the supplement adds much benefit. There was also no discussion of cost and no independent expert perspective. Consumers spend millions of dollars on supplements, and these supplements are not well regulated. Any story about benefits runs the risk of sending people to their wallets, and they should be particularly cautious. Pre-menstrual syndrome, which is the butt of many jokes, is a severe problem for a small minority of women and can cause cyclic symptoms: bloating, fatigue, mood swings and headache. While only a minority has severe symptoms, many women have some of these. Journalists have an additional responsibility to provide context and caution when they report on claims of benefit from an unregulated substance for a huge population.",Study: Fatty acids can help ease PMS symptoms,"This story reports on a recent study that found that women who took a combination of fatty acids had fewer premenstrual symptoms than those who took a placebo. The story does a good job of describing the study and the potential benefits of the treatment. However, the story should have done a better job of describing the potential harms of the treatment and the costs. The story also should have included an independent perspective on the study. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common problem that affects many women. Although the symptoms are often mild, for some women they can be severe and disruptive. The development of an effective treatment for PMS would be a welcome addition to the armamentarium of the clinician treating women with this problem. This study adds to the evidence that fatty acids may be an effective treatment for PMS."
308,"### Context: A recent study suggests that taking fish oil supplements during the last trimester of pregnancy may lead to stronger and healthier children. The study involved 736 pregnant women who were randomly assigned to take either fish oil supplements or olive oil supplements. The researchers found that at age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements had higher total mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content compared to children whose mothers took olive oil supplements.

However, the article does not mention the cost of fish oil supplements. While the cost is reasonable and the recommended period of use is short, it would have been helpful to provide some context on whether the reported differences in weight and bone mineral content are clinically meaningful. The article also fails to discuss the potential risks of taking fish oil supplements, such as belching, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, loose stools, rash, and nosebleeds. These details are important for pregnant women who need to be cautious about any side effects.

The study used both an experimental and control group, with a large number of participants, which adds to its credibility. The primary focus of the study was the development of asthma, not growth. The article includes comments from independent sources and does not appear to have any conflicts of interest.

While the article briefly mentions other research in this area, it would have been beneficial to provide more context and discuss the findings of other studies. Past trials of fish oil supplements during pregnancy or breastfeeding have shown mixed results, and it would have been helpful to understand the possible mechanisms for the effect of fish oil on offspring growth.

Overall, the article suggests that fish oil supplements during pregnancy may have positive effects on the growth and development of children. However, it lacks important information such as the cost of the supplements, the clinical significance of the reported differences, and the potential risks associated with taking fish oil. Additionally, more context and discussion of other research in this area would have strengthened the article.
Claim: Fish Oil Pills During Pregnancy Might Mean Stronger, Healthier Kids
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This HealthDay story describes a study published in the British Medical Journal that looked at whether pregnant women who took fish oil supplements in their third trimester produced healthier children based on their growth statistics and body mass index, compared to mothers who did not. The study was a high-quality randomized controlled trial of the effects of fish oil during pregnancy on asthma in children, which looked at effects on body mass index as a secondary outcome measure. The story included multiple independent sources to provide perspective, and it included a few key details about the study. While it provided the scope of the benefit of taking fish oil, it could have gone a step further to explain if those measured benefits really mean much for children’s health. There is great interest in understanding the effects of interventions during pregnancy on the health of the offspring, but such studies are difficult to conduct, since assessing outcomes that occur years following the pregnancy can be a challenge. Although the effects of fish oil supplements on children’s growth was not the primary intention of this trial, the results do suggest that mothers who take the supplements during their last trimester have children whose body mass index and body measurements for up to six years of age are better than the children of mothers who didn’t take the supplements. If a simple supplement can actually lead to that kind of improvement in children’s that would be an important finding for public health.","Fish Oil Pills During Pregnancy Might Mean Stronger, Healthier Kids","This is a story about a recent study that found that taking fish oil supplements during the last trimester of pregnancy may lead to stronger and healthier children.

309,"### Context: The article discusses Governor Rick Scott's repeated claim that Citizens Property Insurance has over $500 billion worth of risk exposure and only $6 billion in cash surplus. The article argues that while these numbers are technically true, they do not accurately represent the financial health of Citizens. 

First, the article explains that the $6 billion in cash surplus is only part of the funds that Citizens uses to pay hurricane claims. The insurer also has backup insurance from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, private reinsurance, and the ability to sell bonds. In total, Citizens has about $19.5 billion in claims-paying ability, more than three times the amount cited by the governor. 

Second, the article addresses the claim that Citizens has $500 billion in total risk exposure. It explains that this number is extreme and would only be reached in the event of a superstorm 25 times as ferocious as Hurricane Andrew hitting all 67 counties in Florida. A more realistic estimate of maximum losses would be a 1-in-100-year storm, which would cost Citizens a maximum of $21 billion. 

The article concludes that while Citizens does face financial challenges, the numbers used by Governor Scott are misleading. The appropriate figures to consider are Citizens' total claims-paying ability compared to the damage caused by a once-in-a-century hurricane. 

Overall, the article challenges Governor Scott's claim that Citizens Property Insurance has over $500 billion worth of risk and only $6 billion in surplus. It argues that these numbers do not accurately represent the insurer's financial position and that more appropriate figures should be used when assessing its ability to pay claims.

310,"### Context: The claim that Italy will stop caring for elderly patients who are infected with COVID-19 is a distortion of the situation. The post on Facebook that made this claim was in response to guidelines issued by the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI). These guidelines predict an increase in patients requiring intensive care that may cause a strain on resources. The group suggests that in extraordinary circumstances, providers may need to prioritize patients with the greatest life expectancy.

The post failed to consider that similar choices were being discussed in capitalist countries like the United States. Pandemic strategy plans in several states address the question of rationing care as a last resort. Hospital officials and doctors have begun experimenting with other ways to increase capacity, such as transferring patients from crowded urban facilities to community or rural hospitals. If capacity is still exceeded, novel approaches like having two patients on one ventilator or reusing sanitized tubing could be attempted. Rationing protocols would only be put into place if these strategies fail.

It is important to note that approaches to rationing care vary by state and even by hospital. Most plans include a list of serious conditions that would exclude someone from receiving a ventilator if rationing were in effect, and many of these conditions are more common in the elderly.

The misleading post on Facebook and others like it were shared thousands of times, but it distorts the reality of the situation. Italy is not stopping care for elderly patients infected with COVID-19. The guidelines issued by SIAARTI simply suggest that in extraordinary circumstances, providers may need to prioritize patients with the greatest life expectancy. Similar discussions about rationing care are taking place in capitalist countries like the United States as well.

311,"### Context: The University of Würzburg in Germany hosted an event in May 2018 with the theme of ""Future Societys"" that featured a controversial presentation by Mirjam Heine, a medical student. In her talk, Heine discussed the topic of pedophilia and argued that our perception of it needs to change. She shared the story of a 19-year-old law student who is sexually attracted to girls aged six to 12 but has never acted on his desires due to awareness of the harm it could cause. Heine referred to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10) for the definition of pedophilia as a ""sexual preference for preadolescent children"" and mentioned research that distinguishes between child sexual abusers and pedophiles.

Heine's comments about pedophilia being an ""unchangeable sexual orientation"" caused controversy when they were reported by various websites under misleading headlines. However, in the fuller context of her talk, Heine clarified that she does not condone child abuse and emphasized that a pedophile who does not harm children has done nothing wrong. She stated that current research suggests pedophilia is an unchangeable sexual orientation, similar to heterosexuality, but living out this orientation would lead to disastrous consequences.

The classification of pedophilia as a sexual orientation has been contentious, as it is classified as a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) and not recognized as a sexual orientation by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Equating pedophilia with sexual orientation has been problematic due to false beliefs linking the LGBT community to child molestation.

TEDx, the platform where Heine gave her talk, acknowledged that the controversial talk took place but clarified that TEDx events are organized independently from the main TED conference. They removed the video at Heine's request due to her concerns about her safety and the potential misinterpretation of her research citations. TEDx events are held worldwide, and the main TED organization does not control their content.

In conclusion, the article highlights the controversial talk given by Mirjam Heine at a TEDx event, where she discussed pedophilia as an unchangeable sexual orientation. However, it clarifies that Heine does not condone child abuse and emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between pedophiles who harm children and those who do not. The article also addresses the classification of pedophilia as a disorder and the concerns surrounding equating it with sexual orientation. TEDx removed the video at Heine's request due to safety concerns and potential misinterpretation of her research.

312,"### Context: The article discusses the potential of gene therapy as a treatment for brain diseases. It mentions that while some therapeutic strategies have been approved in China and Europe, none have been approved in the United States. The article highlights the high cost of gene therapies, with one European company pricing their therapy at $1.4 million per injection. However, it does not provide much information on pricing for gene therapies in general. The article primarily focuses on the positive results seen in animal studies, but does not provide quantified results or cautionary statements about extrapolating these benefits to humans. It mentions a human research trial for a vision disorder where 21 patients experienced the ""maximum possible benefit"" of vision restoration, but does not quantify the actual benefits. The article acknowledges the potential risks and harms associated with gene therapy, but does not provide clear information on the extent of these risks. It mentions the death of a clinical trial participant in 1999 that halted gene therapy trials in the US and notes that risk accompanies many therapies. The article emphasizes the growing interest of financial backers in gene therapy, but does not discuss the actual quality of evidence supporting its effectiveness. It mentions that some of the diseases discussed have no alternative treatments, but does not provide a balanced discussion on the limitations of animal research or the appropriateness of gene therapy for all brain conditions. The article also does not clearly explain the timeline for the availability of gene therapies discussed. Overall, the article presents gene therapy as a promising treatment option for brain diseases, but lacks in-depth analysis and balanced information on its effectiveness, risks, and limitations.
Claim: GENE THERAPY MIGHT BE THE BEST, AND PERHAPS ONLY, CHANCE AT CURING BRAIN DISEASES
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This in-depth story takes a look at the work of scientists who are trying to repair gene-deficient mice using “gene therapy.” These researchers hope to one day apply these still-experimental treatments to people who suffer from a variety of serious neurological conditions, but the focus in this story is mostly on a rare fatal condition known as Canavan disease. The heart-rending narratives that dot this account make for vivid reading, and the story does an admirable job of reflecting the hope and enthusiasm of some of the scientists on the front lines of this work. It offers readable explanations of how these researchers are modifying gene delivery strategies to overcome tragic problems uncovered by earlier clinical studies that led to a wholesale halt in work with humans. But the bottom line here is that nearly all of the promising research of the present has been conducted in mice, making the enthusiasm that permeates this story premature. Instead of deeply discussing the challenges in moving from animal data into medical interventions, the story spends more time on the growing financial interest among investors. The first quote in the story is from a venture capitalist, for example. While it’s important to discuss the biotech buzz surrounding gene therapy research, it’s also important to provide clarity on how challenging it will be to turn the research into actual treatments, even when experiments are amply funded. Genetic diseases of the brain are difficult to treat. If gene therapy offers an avenue for intervention, it would offer hope where there currently is little.","GENE THERAPY MIGHT BE THE BEST, AND PERHAPS ONLY, CHANCE AT CURING BRAIN DISEASES","The story focuses on the potential of gene therapy to treat brain diseases.

However, in a speech during a campaign rally in South Carolina, Trump did not directly call the virus itself a hoax. He accused Democrats of politicizing the coronavirus outbreak and criticized their critiques of his administration's handling of the potential pandemic. Trump stated that Democrats were using the virus as a political tool against him. He mentioned previous attempts by Democrats to undermine his presidency, such as the Russia investigation and impeachment, and referred to the coronavirus as their ""new hoax."" 

Later in his speech, Trump compared the number of coronavirus fatalities in the U.S. (which was none at that point) to the number of fatalities during an average flu season. He mentioned that on average, 35,000 people die each year from the flu and accused the press of being in ""hysteria mode"" because there were no reported deaths from the coronavirus in the United States at that time.

Overall, while Trump did not directly call the virus a hoax, his comments during the rally suggested that he believed Democrats were using the outbreak as a political tool against him.

314,"### Context: The article discusses a study conducted by researchers at City of Hope, which suggests that regular use of low-dose aspirin can reduce the risk of breast cancer in women. The study found that women who reported using low-dose aspirin at least three times per week had a 16% lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 20% lower risk of the most common subtype of breast cancer. However, the article highlights that this was an observational study and not a clinical study, meaning it cannot prove a causal relationship between aspirin use and reduced breast cancer risk.

The article also points out that the release does not address potential harms associated with regular use of low-dose aspirin. It mentions that daily aspirin use can cause serious gastrointestinal bleeding in some people, and that people with certain medical conditions are at greater risk of complications from aspirin therapy. The release fails to mention these risks in the context of breast cancer prevention.

Furthermore, the article criticizes the release for not addressing other factors that may have contributed to the difference in breast cancer rates, such as age, weight, and lifestyle choices. It also notes that over 4,000 women who had developed breast cancer before the 10-year follow-up were excluded from the study, and questions how these women differed in their aspirin intake compared to those who developed breast cancer later on.

The article mentions that the release does not engage in disease mongering and clearly identifies the sources of funding. However, it suggests that conflicts of interest should have been addressed explicitly. The release is also criticized for not mentioning other ways to reduce breast cancer risk, and for claiming novelty in the study when previous studies have also examined the potential preventative effects of aspirin on breast cancer.

Overall, the article highlights the limitations and potential biases in the release regarding the study on aspirin and breast cancer risk. It emphasizes the need for caution in interpreting the results of observational studies and the importance of considering potential harms and other contributing factors.
Claim: City of Hope researchers find regular use of aspirin can lower risk of breast cancer for women
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The release focuses on a recent paper published in the journal Breast Cancer Research, which addresses breast cancer risk and regular use of aspirin in low doses. While the release states that low doses of aspirin “reduces the risk of breast cancer in women,” there are problems with how the information is presented. Specifically, it’s impossible to know whether the aspirin affected breast cancer risk based on this study. That’s because this was an observational study — meaning that it could detect a correlation between aspirin use and breast cancer, but not whether the use of aspirin was actually responsible for lower rates of breast cancer. That’s a key distinction. Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in the United States and is diagnosed in hundreds of thousands of women each year. That means many thousands — if not millions — of women and their loved ones are on the lookout for things they can do to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Telling the public that aspirin reduces cancer risk has the potential to influence the daily decisions of those women, which is problematic when the relevant study is unable to make that determination. What’s more, daily aspirin use can cause or exacerbate other health problems, which this release does not address at all.",City of Hope researchers find regular use of aspirin can lower risk of breast cancer for women,"This news release from the City of Hope National Medical Institute describes a study that found women who regularly took low-dose aspirin had a lower risk of developing breast cancer. The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it doesn’t address the limitations of observational studies, which can’t prove cause and effect. It also doesn’t address the potential harms of aspirin use, which can include serious gastrointestinal bleeding. The release also doesn’t address the possibility that the women who took aspirin may have differed in other ways from the women who did not take aspirin. The release also doesn’t address the cost of aspirin, which is a significant issue. Aspirin is a widely used drug, and the idea that it can reduce the risk of breast cancer is likely to generate a lot of interest. But the release doesn’t address the limitations of the study, which is an important consideration."
315,"### Context: During a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, Senator Bernie Sanders criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for being too hawkish in the Middle East. He argued that Clinton was too aggressive and did not consider the unintended consequences of regime change. Clinton responded by claiming that Sanders had previously voted for regime change in Libya. 

The article examines whether Clinton's claim is accurate. It explains that the U.S. military supported the Libyan uprising against former leader Muammar Gaddafi, which resulted in his ousting in August 2011. Congress never voted to authorize U.S. military action in Libya, so what was Clinton referring to? 

The article reveals that on March 1, 2011, the Senate approved a resolution condemning the human rights violations in Libya. Although senators did not vote on the resolution, Sanders showed his support by joining as one of the cosponsors. The resolution called for peaceful regime change and for Gaddafi to resign and allow a peaceful transition to democracy. However, the resolution had no legal weight and was more of a statement expressing the general ""sense of Congress."" 

Sanders' campaign argued that Clinton misrepresented his record because the resolution was nonbinding and did not show support for U.S. military action. In a March 2011 interview, Sanders stated that he wanted Gaddafi gone but was hesitant about engaging in another war while already involved in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

Clinton also claimed that Sanders' vote signaled support for United Nations action to remove Gaddafi. The article explains that two related U.N. resolutions called for measures to pressure Gaddafi to stop human rights abuses but did not explicitly call for regime change. However, Clinton and other leaders used these resolutions as a platform to take actions that they hoped would pressure Gaddafi to step down and allow a transition to democracy. 

In conclusion, the article rates Clinton's statement as partially true. While Sanders did support a nonbinding Senate resolution calling for Gaddafi's resignation, it did not indicate support for U.S. military action or explicit regime change. Sanders expressed concerns about engaging in another war and emphasized the need for a peaceful transition in Libya.
Claim: Hillary Clinton Says Bernie Sanders ""voted for regime change with respect to Libya.

Sanders supported a non-binding Senate resolution that called on Gaddafi to resign his post in a peaceful, democratic transition of power. While the Senate passed the resolution by unanimous consent -- meaning no one actually voted on it -- Sanders was one of 10 cosponsors. At the time, Sanders told the media he wanted Gaddafi out of power, but it might not be worth it if it required sustained U.S. military involvement.","Hillary Clinton Says Bernie Sanders ""voted for regime change with respect to Libya.","Clinton said Sanders """"voted for regime change with respect to Libya.""""

316,"### Context: The article discusses the effectiveness and risks of obesity drugs. It criticizes the lack of information on the costs of drug or surgical treatments and the failure to quantify the benefits and harms of these drugs. The story is accused of disease-mongering by presenting obesity as a disease that can be cured with the right pill. It argues that pharmaceuticals may not be the only effective treatment for obesity and that the central problem lies in the difficulty of altering metabolism without producing unhealthy side effects. The article also highlights the ties some sources have to the pharmaceutical industry, such as the Obesity Society, which is funded by drug companies. It suggests that conflicts of interest should have been disclosed. However, the article praises the story for explaining the challenges in finding a drug that effectively reduces weight without increasing the risk of other health problems, particularly cardiovascular issues. It concludes that the story does a good job of highlighting the lack of effective obesity treatments and the struggles faced by anti-obesity drugs.
Claim: Weighing effectiveness versus risk in obesity drugs
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story endeavors in a noble task: providing readers with an assessment of the landscape for obesity drugs. We wish more stories took this broad view when writing about new drug studies or approvals. The article does a good job of framing the key issues, asking, essentially, whether is there enough benefit to justify the side effects. Not often do stories address this issue, and we applaud their approach. The story comes close to achieving a balance in its attempt to answer this question. For example, the statements by Thomas and Wolfe are excellent alternative opinions to the views espoused by the obesity drug expert camp. But we wish this story had gone beyond a he said/she said look at the evidence and that it had not relied so heavily on sources that have strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry, which is pushing hard for looser restrictions on anti-obesity drug approvals. There also is some clear disease-mongering in the article, which gives it the unsavory taste while you read it. As this story notes, a third of the US adult population is obese, and the situation has only worsened in recent years, despite concerted public health efforts to address this serious public health threat. Pills, though, are just one part of the equation. From reading this story, people might believe that the only reason people are obese is because they don’t have access to the right pills. How does this explain the huge contrast between the US and other developed countries in terms of obesity? How does this explain the rapid rise in average body-mass index over the past three decades and the resulting rise in diabetes, heart disease and other health problems? The story accepts as its underlying premise that obesity would melt away if drug companies could find the right pill and that they are being scared away by the big bad FDA. Even a story that is primarily focused on the drug industry and not the root causes of obesity should have given more weight to the evidence about the health problems resulting from obesity drugs.",Weighing effectiveness versus risk in obesity drugs,"This is a story about the challenges of developing a drug to treat obesity. It does a good job of explaining the challenges of finding a drug that can reduce weight without producing unhealthy side effects, particularly cardiovascular problems.

317,"### Context: In an interview with Fox News, Rep. Dan Boren argued against eliminating tax breaks for oil companies, claiming that the biggest financial impact would be felt by smaller companies in his oil-rich state of Oklahoma. To fact-check this claim, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) commissioned a study from consulting firm IHS Global Insight. The study defined ""independents"" as all North American operators excluding major companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. According to the study, independents accounted for 62-67% of domestic oil and gas production in 2010, which is a healthy majority but not a ""vast majority"" as Boren claimed. 

However, it is important to note that the statistics include some larger companies like Devon Energy Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp., which reported billions of dollars in revenue and net income in 2010. While these companies are smaller compared to ExxonMobil, they are not what most people would consider ""small independent oil and gas companies."" 

In conclusion, Boren's claim that a vast majority of U.S. oil and gas production comes from small independent companies is exaggerated. While independents do account for a majority of production, it is not as significant as Boren suggested. Additionally, some of the companies included in the ""independent"" category are not small in size.

318,"### Context: The claim that a new gun law in California will allow police to seize guns without prior notice is untrue. The law, known as the gun violence restraining order bill (Assembly Bill 1014), allows police to seize guns from their owners for up to 21 days if a court agrees that the gun owner is a threat to themselves or others. However, the law requires that written notice of the order be served to the gun owner. The bill also authorizes a court to issue an ex parte gun violence restraining order, which prohibits the subject of the petition from having firearms or ammunition if there is a substantial likelihood that they pose a significant danger of harm to themselves or others. The ex parte order expires no later than 21 days after it is issued, and a hearing is held within 21 days to determine if a gun violence restraining order should be issued for one year. If a gun owner refuses to surrender their weapons, law enforcement officials would execute a search warrant to confiscate them. Breaking the temporary restraining order would result in a misdemeanor and a weapons and ammunition ban of up to five years. The law was passed in response to a mass shooting in Santa Barbara in 2014 and aims to temporarily separate individuals who pose an imminent threat from their weapons. The law was passed by the California Legislature, not the federal government or President Obama. It is also important to note that the law should not be confused with California's Armed & Prohibited Persons System (APPS), which has been in place since 2001. APPS identifies individuals who illegally own or possess guns and aims to confiscate them. Overall, the claim that the new gun law in California allows police to seize guns without prior notice is false.

319,"### Context: The claim that a woman became pregnant from being struck by a bullet that had passed through the scrotum of a Civil War soldier is completely false. The story originated as a joke in an article published in The American Medical Weekly in 1874. The article recounted the tale of a Confederate field surgeon who dressed the wounds of a soldier injured by a bullet that had entered his leg, ricocheted off the bone, and carried away his left testicle. The same surgeon was then called upon to administer aid to a young lady who had received a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Exactly 278 days later, the surgeon delivered a baby boy for the wounded woman, who maintained that she was still a virgin. The article was meant to be humorous, but subsequent journals and books cited it as fact without realizing it was a joke. The story has been passed down through the years as an ""actual case that appeared in a real medical journal many years ago.""

The original article from The American Medical Weekly, an editor's note explaining it was a gag, a misinterpreted summation from a book published in 1896, and a 1959 article by a doctor who didn't realize it was a joke are included in the article. These sources have been cited as proof of the occurrence in various publications, including American Heritage magazine and ""Dear Abby.""

The article includes the original account of the incident, which describes how a bullet passed through the scrotum of a soldier and then penetrated the abdomen of a young lady. The young lady recovered from her injuries and, six months later, gave birth to a baby boy. The doctor who treated her later operated on the baby and extracted the bullet from his scrotum. The doctor theorized that the bullet had carried particles of semen and spermatozoa into the woman's uterus, resulting in her pregnancy.

In conclusion, the claim that a woman became pregnant from being struck by a bullet that had passed through the scrotum of a Civil War soldier is a well-traveled legend that originated as a joke in an article published in 1874. The story has been passed down through the years as an actual case, but it is completely false.

The number of cases has risen steadily the last five years, with 160 reported last year after only 93 in 2013. Lyme disease is passed to humans by deer ticks and can cause flu-like illnesses, muscle pain and headaches. A rash shaped like a bull’s-eye is often seen around tick bites.

321,"### Context: The claim that there is a new outbreak of HPV in Kenya that spreads through kissing and is deadlier than HIV/AIDS is false. The article states that unreliable websites spread this fabricated story, and there is no corroboration from reliable local news media or the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa. HPV is a collection of viral infections transmitted through skin and mucous membrane contact during sexual activities, not through kissing. While HPV is the world's most common sexually transmitted infection, it usually does not come with harmful symptoms and can go undetected for decades. Certain strains of HPV can lead to genital warts and various types of cancer, but it often takes years or even decades for cancerous tumors to develop. The fake articles present an implausible and misleading picture of college students falling ill and being admitted to the hospital due to an outbreak of HPV, which is not how HPV spreads or its repercussions. The article also highlights the context of fabricated health scares in Africa, particularly around HIV/AIDS. The juxtaposition of HPV and HIV is intentional, as HIV/AIDS is still a significant concern in Africa. The article mentions the prevalence of misinformation about HIV/AIDS, including claims that it doesn't exist or was invented by white colonialists. It also mentions the damaging effects of HIV/AIDS denialism during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki in South Africa, where cheap antiretroviral drugs were not approved. In summary, the claim of a new outbreak of HPV in Kenya that spreads through kissing and is deadlier than HIV/AIDS is false and part of a larger context of misinformation surrounding healthcare in Africa.

322,"### Context: California lawmakers have rejected a bill that would have banned all procedures on intersex children aged 6 and under, unless deemed medically necessary by the Medical Board of California. State Senator Scott Wiener, who wrote the measure, argued that it was a civil rights issue and would allow intersex individuals to make their own choices about their health and gender identity. However, a majority of state lawmakers on a key legislative committee believed that the bill's definition of ""intersex"" was too broad and could limit doctors' ability to treat patients with complex medical issues. Three Democrats and one Republican on the Senate Business, Professions and Economic Development Committee voted against the bill.

State Senator Jerry Hill expressed concern about limiting surgeries until a child was 6, questioning whether a child of that age could make such a decision. Wiener clarified that parents would still have the final decision, but delaying the procedures until a child could communicate would help parents make an informed choice. Despite the rejection, Wiener vowed to continue pushing for the bill in the future.

Intersex people are born with genitalia, chromosomes, or reproductive organs that do not fit typical definitions for males or females. The bill aimed to protect the rights of intersex individuals, who make up approximately 1% to 2% of the population, according to Wiener.

During the public hearing, testimony was given by people born with intersex traits, some of whom supported the bill and others who did not. Bria Brown-King, who was born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, shared their experience of having surgery at the age of 13, which they felt was unnecessary and violated their autonomy. Pediatric urologist Hillary Copp opposed the bill, arguing that it would remove flexibility for medical professionals to act in the best interest of the patient. She emphasized that doctors do not assign genders but rather discuss the baby and the complex issues involved.

The bill faced opposition from various medical groups, including the California Medical Association, which donated $50,000 to a committee working to reelect Senator Steve Glazer, the chairman of the panel that rejected the bill. However, the committee that received the donation has no official ties to Glazer's campaign, and he did not cast a vote on the bill.

323,"### Context: The article titled ""Music May Help Ease Pain for Anxious People"" discusses a study that suggests music therapy could potentially reduce pain in individuals with anxiety. However, the article lacks important information and critical analysis.

The claim states that cost is not relevant in this case, and the article does not provide any information regarding the cost of music therapy or its accessibility. The article also fails to explain how pain reduction was measured or quantify the degree of pain relief experienced by the 143 study participants.

Furthermore, the article does not clarify whether pain or anxiety was the dominant issue being addressed in the study. It also fails to mention the specific type of pain or the conditions the study participants were experiencing, making it difficult to evaluate the relevance of the findings.

The article solely relies on a news release as its source, without providing any independent perspective or critical analysis. It also does not compare music therapy with other known methods of pain relief, further limiting the understanding of its effectiveness.

The article lacks important details about the music used in the therapy, the duration of exposure, and the setting in which the study took place. These factors could potentially impact the availability and applicability of music therapy as a pain relief approach.

Additionally, the article fails to acknowledge past research on music therapy in other fields, suggesting a lack of comprehensive understanding of the topic.

In conclusion, the article does not provide sufficient information or critical analysis to support the claim that music therapy can effectively reduce pain in anxious individuals. The lack of details, reliance on a single source, and absence of comparison with other methods of pain relief make the article unsatisfactory in providing a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

324,"### Context: Two new drugs have shown promise in treating advanced breast cancer, according to a study led by Dr. Ian Krop of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The first drug, called T-DXd, was tested on 253 women with HER2-positive breast cancer, a type of cancer that has too much of a protein called HER2 on its cell surfaces. The drug, given as an infusion every three weeks, resulted in a 61% tumor shrinkage rate and a 6% rate of no signs of cancer in follow-up scans. The median time until cancer worsened was 16 months, which is significant for such serious cancers. However, side effects were substantial, with 60% of women experiencing low blood counts, nausea, anemia, or fatigue, and 15% stopping treatment due to side effects. Twenty-five women developed lung inflammation, and four died from it, a rare side effect associated with the drug. Despite the side effects, the drug is still considered beneficial for most patients.

The second drug, called tucatinib, was tested on 612 participants, half of whom had breast cancer that had spread to the brain. These patients are often excluded from tests of new drugs due to their poor prognosis. The study found that after two years, 45% of those on tucatinib were alive compared to 27% of the control group. Among the women whose cancer had spread to the brain, one quarter were alive with no worsening of the brain tumors a year later. Side effects of tucatinib included diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and some liver side effects. About 6% of the tucatinib group stopped treatment due to side effects.

Both drugs are seeking approval for use in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. The study was sponsored by the drug developers, Daiichi Sankyo Inc. and AstraZeneca, and the researchers consult for the companies. Dr. Jennifer Litton of the MD Anderson Cancer Center suggests that preventative anti-inflammatory medicines may be given to patients to mitigate the lung inflammation side effect associated with T-DXd. Dr. Eric Winer of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute highlights the ability of tucatinib to reach the brain, which is notoriously difficult to treat.

Overall, these new drugs show promise in treating advanced breast cancer, particularly in reaching tumors in the brain and delivering chemotherapy directly to cancer cells. However, substantial side effects were observed, and further research is needed to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of these drugs.

325,"### Context: J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced controversy in September 2020 after promoting an online store that sells merchandise with ""gender critical"" or transphobic messages. She posted a photo of herself wearing a shirt from the store called Wild Wymen Workshop, which has a section dedicated to ""gender critical"" items. The store owner, Angela C. Wild, expressed her views on transgender ideology and stated that she does not believe in gender or that anyone can be born in the wrong body.

The story gained traction on Facebook, with one post sharing LGBTQ Nation's article being shared thousands of times within 24 hours. Rowling's endorsement of the online shop coincided with the release of her new mystery novel written under the pseudonym ""Robert Galbraith."" Reviewers noted that one of the characters in the novel, Creed, dresses like a woman to deceive his victims. Rowling revealed on Galbraith's website that Creed was loosely based on real-life killers Jerry Brudos and Russell Williams, who were known for stealing women's underwear.

Rowling has faced criticism in the past for spreading disinformation about transgender people, and her endorsement of the online shop and portrayal of a character dressing as a woman further fueled the controversy. Additionally, Rowling's choice of the pseudonym ""Galbraith"" raised eyebrows as it was similar to the name of American psychologist Robert Galbraith Heath, who claimed to be able to ""cure"" homosexuality through brain experiments. However, journalist Robert Colvile clarified that there was no connection between Rowling and Heath.

In summary, J.K. Rowling faced backlash for promoting a website selling transphobic merchandise and for her portrayal of a character dressing as a woman in her new novel. Her choice of pseudonym also raised concerns, although there was no actual connection to the controversial psychologist Robert Galbraith Heath.

326,"### Context: The claim that Nora Kirkpatrick, an American actor, played a victim in a fake terrorist bomb attack at Parsons Green in London is false. The Crisis Actor Facebook page falsely reported that a woman photographed at the scene of the bomb attack was Nora Kirkpatrick, but this claim has been proven to be untrue. The Crisis Actor's post also included other claims suggesting that the bomb attack was a hoax, but these claims have been found to be false, misleading, or irrelevant.

One of the claims made by the Crisis Actor was that one of the police constables at the scene was wearing jeans, which they suggested was suspicious. However, it was found that the photograph provided by the Crisis Actor actually showed police officers in plain clothes, and there are non-suspect explanations for why a police officer might be wearing jeans.

Another claim made by the Crisis Actor was that the police car registration number shown in the incident was a hire car from a film props company, suggesting that it was not a genuine police vehicle. However, it was discovered that the police van bearing that registration number has been part of the British Transport Police fleet since at least 2014.

The Crisis Actor also questioned the severity of the injuries sustained by a woman pictured with a burnt ear in a bandage, as she was seen using her phone next to the same ear. However, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the extent of her injuries based on the photograph, and the Crisis Actor's evidence was inconclusive.

Lastly, the Crisis Actor raised doubts about the nature of the bomb used in the attack, pointing out the lack of extensive damage and smoke. An explosives expert explained that the evidence suggested the bomb was a TATP device that did not detonate properly, which would explain the absence of damage typically seen in homemade bombs.

In conclusion, the claim that Nora Kirkpatrick played a victim in a fake terrorist bomb attack is false. The Crisis Actor's claims and suggestions that the Parsons Green attack was a hoax have been debunked, with evidence showing that the claims were either false, misleading, or irrelevant.

327,"### Context: The article discusses the high infant mortality rate in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and specifically in the neighborhoods surrounding the University Circle area. The infant mortality rate is considered an important indicator of a community's well-being and is one of the factors that contributed to Cuyahoga County's low ranking in overall health in a national study. Ohio's infant mortality rate is the 11th worst in the nation, with 7.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in the first year of life. In Cuyahoga County, the most recent reported rate is 9.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, and the average from 2006 to 2010 was 9.7 deaths.

Dr. Michele Walsh, a neonatology expert, stated that within the three-mile radius of the University Circle area, the infant mortality rate exceeds some Third World countries. This statement is based on data from a study conducted by researchers at Case Western Reserve University Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences, which draws from various sources such as the U.S. Census and the Ohio Department of Health.

To fact-check Dr. Walsh's statement, the article looked at data for neighborhoods on Cleveland's East Side within three miles of University Circle. It found that two neighborhoods, Hough and Mount Pleasant, had infant mortality rates above 27 per 1,000 live births, worse than countries like North Korea, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Samoa, Maldives, and the Gaza Strip. Two other neighborhoods, Kinsman and South Collinwood, had infant mortality rates worse than Zimbabwe. The University Circle neighborhood itself had an infant mortality rate slightly above 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, exceeding rates in countries like Bangladesh, Haiti, Burma, Cameroon, Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Rwanda, and Uganda.

However, the article notes that the high rate for the University Circle neighborhood is based on a small statistical base in 2009, with 43 births and 3 infant deaths. The most recent three-year average for the neighborhood is 18.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is still unacceptable and almost double the countywide rate.

Overall, the article highlights the alarming infant mortality rate in Cuyahoga County, particularly in the neighborhoods surrounding the University Circle area. The rate is higher than some Third World countries, and efforts need to be made to address the underlying factors contributing to this issue.

The school is renovating an old building and working towards accreditation from the American Osteopathic Association. The idea for the medical school came from Philip Keithahn, who saw an opportunity to improve economic development and healthcare in the rural community of Gaylord. Osteopathic medical schools have been opening in small communities across the country, providing hope for rural regions that struggle to recruit primary care physicians. These schools have a track record of supplying physicians for medically underserved areas. The proposed Gaylord school has received support from community leaders and has the potential to generate economic growth in the area. The school plans to collaborate with nearby colleges and establish residency agreements with clinics and health systems in the Upper Midwest. The project is made possible by the high-speed internet fiber laid through town a few years ago. The school aims to immerse medical students in a rural area in the hopes that they will choose to practice in similar communities. The Minnesota College of Osteopathic Medicine will be the first osteopathic medical school in Minnesota, with the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic having traditional medical schools. The school plans to use simulation labs, 3D technology, and other technological innovations to enhance the learning experience. The initial class is expected to have 75 students, but the school hopes to eventually double in size, enrolling up to 600 students.

329,"### Context: The UK Supreme Court is currently hearing a case that seeks to change Northern Ireland's strict abortion laws. Currently, abortion is only allowed in Northern Ireland when a mother's life is in danger, and the penalty for undergoing or performing an unlawful abortion is life imprisonment. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission argues that this law violates the human rights of women and girls. The case has been ongoing since 2014 and is now being heard by a panel of seven Supreme Court judges in London.

During the hearing, lead counsel Nathalie Lieven presented detailed evidence from several women and girls. One of the cases described was that of Ashleigh Topley, who was told during her pregnancy that her baby's limbs were not growing and she was going to die. Topley had to carry on with the pregnancy until her baby died inside the womb or until she went into labor, causing the baby to die. She endured 15 weeks of anguish and suffered from well-meaning questions from others. Another case involved a girl under 13 who became pregnant as a result of sexual abuse by a relative and had to travel outside of Northern Ireland for an abortion.

Northern Ireland's elected assembly voted against changing abortion laws in 2016. However, the law is less restrictive in the rest of the United Kingdom, leading hundreds of Northern Irish women to travel to England each year for abortions. In addition to the parties involved in the case, the court will also hear from organizations that support changing the law, such as Humanists UK, Amnesty International, and a United Nations working group on discrimination against women. On the other side, groups opposing any reform, such as Catholic bishops from Northern Ireland and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, argue against changing the law.

The Supreme Court judges will hear arguments for and against the proposed changes during a three-day hearing and will give their judgment at a later date.

330,"### Context: The article discusses a news release that claims certain foods can help prevent or shrink prostate cancer tumors. However, the article points out several issues with the claims made in the news release.

Firstly, the article mentions that the cost of adding these foods to one's diet would be negligible for most people, but taking supplements over a long period could be costly. It also highlights that there is no data on how much of these substances need to be consumed or for how long to offer cancer protection or tumor shrinkage.

The article criticizes the news release for contradicting itself. While it suggests that eating a diet containing cancer-fighting substances could be beneficial, it also quotes a researcher saying that increasing the concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet is necessary for an effect on prostate cancer cells, implying the need for supplements.

The article also raises concerns about the potential toxicity of these substances when consumed in combination with certain drugs or at high concentrations. It notes that dietary supplements, which are not tightly regulated by the FDA, pose an added risk for consumers.

Furthermore, the article points out that studying how these compounds perform in mice and human cell lines does not predict their performance in humans. Extensive human trials are required to draw conclusions about safety and efficacy.

The article also criticizes the news release for oversimplifying the issues of prevention and treatment. It mentions that there are proven strategies to reduce overall cancer risk, such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising, and eating a variety of plant foods. However, the news release does not mention these strategies or the current treatment options for prostate cancer.

The article concludes by stating that the claim made in the news release, ""Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner,"" is unjustifiable. It highlights that the research mentioned in the news release is novel in its approach to screening plant-based chemicals but does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that these foods can starve or prevent cancer.

Overall, the article raises important questions and concerns about the claims made in the news release and emphasizes the need for further research and human trials to determine the safety and efficacy of these dietary factors in preventing or treating prostate cancer.
Claim: Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release attempts to translate preliminary research on plant chemicals into actionable dietary advice. Bad move. Researchers used an innovative screening strategy to cull through 142 natural compounds to identify a combination of three phytochemicals — found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and red grapes — that inhibited the growth of implanted prostate tumors in mice. Their work is described in the online journal Precision Oncology. But it’s a big leap from the lab table to the dinner table, where the release says that by indulging in certain foods, you can “enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving — or even preventing — cancer.” Nowhere does it warn that studies of cell lines or animals don’t prove a human benefit. Combinations of plant chemicals have become a focus of cancer research, driven by their relative safety, low cost, and wide availability. Lab studies have found substances in plants can reduce inflammation, stimulate the immune system, protect and repair normal cells, and slow the growth of cancer cells, among other things. But research on the effects of these substances to fight specific cancers is still in its infancy, and most experts advise eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for better health. Prostate cancer is an area where men feel particularly vulnerable because it’s widespread — about 3 million American men are living with prostate cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute — and there are few actionable steps for prevention. Suggesting a simple solution — such as eating a few specific foods — may give men a false sense of security.",Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner,"This news release describes a study that screened plant-based chemicals to identify those that might be effective in preventing or treating prostate cancer. The release does a good job of describing the study, but it doesn’t provide enough context to help readers understand the study’s limitations.

331,"### Context: As the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States continues to rise, there is a debate over whether schools should be closed to slow the spread of the virus. In Seattle, where 11 people have died from COVID-19, a Microsoft employee named Davidoff is calling for the closure of Lake Washington School District (LWSD) after signing an online petition demanding school closures. However, the Seattle school district has decided to keep schools open, stating that closures can be disruptive and costly for families unless there is a risk of COVID-19 exposure.

The dilemma over school closures is not unique to Seattle. In New York and Los Angeles, similar controversies are playing out. The outbreak has had a significant impact on schools worldwide, affecting the education of over 290 million students in 13 countries, according to the United Nations. While school closures have been a common response to influenza outbreaks, health authorities are rethinking their approach for COVID-19, as it has shown limited effects on children.

Not all schools in Seattle are staying open. The Northshore School District closed due to possible exposure of staff to COVID-19 and a high student absentee rate. The district has shifted to online education to ensure that children's education continues. Davidoff believes that other districts should follow suit to prevent children from spreading the virus to vulnerable parents.

However, keeping schools open has its benefits. Schools provide more than just education; they also offer meals to over 30 million students and free child care to working families. Additionally, school closures could have a paradoxical effect on the spread of the virus. If children are carrying the infection without showing symptoms, they could become an invisible reservoir for community spread. Sending students home to older caregivers could also expose them to the virus, and students often gather together outside of school, increasing the risk of community spread.

There are differing opinions among parents. Some, like Alicia Aguirre in Los Angeles, are keeping their children home based on the number of cases in their area. Others, like Jamilah Mabruk in Seattle, are conflicted. Mabruk's daughter suffers from asthma and could be vulnerable to the virus, but she is also concerned about her daughter missing school and falling behind academically.

In conclusion, the debate over school closures in the United States is ongoing. While some argue for closures to prevent the spread of the virus, others believe that keeping schools open is necessary to provide essential services and prevent unintended consequences.
Claim: 'Do we really want to close schools?' U.S. authorities resist coronavirus closures.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:

332,"### Context: The claim made by Kathleen Sullivan, Warren's substance abuse coordinator, that the proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years is not supported by the data. The statistics collected from the states by the U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration show that the rate of admissions for substance abuse treatment, primarily for marijuana, peaked in 2009 and then declined in the next two years. The number of admissions also peaked in 2009 and then dropped. The decline in admissions has continued since 2009, according to data from 2012 and 2013. When looking at the trend in admission rates since 1999, there has been no statistically significant increase. The U.S. Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration also stated that there are limitations to the data that make Sullivan's position problematic. One major problem is that an individual can be counted more than once each year depending on how many times they have been admitted for treatment. The data, known as the Treatment Episode Data Set, do not support the assertion that the number of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment has reached its highest point in 20 years. A federal statistician at the agency that compiled the data stated that admission rates have been ""relatively stable"" over the past 20 years. Therefore, the claim made by Kathleen Sullivan is not accurate.
Claim: The proportion of Rhode Islanders entering substance abuse treatment primarily due to marijuana use has reached its highest point in 20 years.

333,"### Context: In a recent speech on the Senate floor, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz claimed that Democrats support ""abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that."" However, this claim is inaccurate. Cruz specifically referenced a bill in the Virginia House of Delegates that aimed to regulate third-trimester abortions. He highlighted a radio interview with Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, where Northam discussed the bill and stated that if a mother is in labor and the infant is born, the infant would be kept comfortable and a discussion would ensue between physicians and the mother. Cruz characterized this as allowing a doctor to kill the child instead of delivering it, which he found horrifying.

It is important to note that the Virginia bill was unsuccessful, and Cruz's characterization of it is inaccurate. Killing an infant after birth is illegal, and both sides of the abortion debate agree that it should be illegal. Under federal law, infants born alive at any stage of development are considered persons, human beings, children, and individuals.

The Virginia bill proposed changes to state laws addressing abortion, including lowering the number of physicians required to authorize a third-trimester abortion from three to one and removing the ""substantial and irremediable"" threshold. However, it did not change the law regarding when such an abortion could take place. Currently, abortion is legal in the third trimester in Virginia only if three physicians certify that the mother's life is in danger. The law also prohibits ""partial birth infanticide,"" which refers to killing an infant who has been born alive but has not been completely extracted or expelled from the mother.

Governor Northam's comments in the radio interview were about options for care available to women with nonviable pregnancies or severe fetal abnormalities. In such cases, families might opt for perinatal palliative care, which prioritizes comfort while allowing the infant to die naturally without full resuscitation efforts. This type of care does not meet the definition of abortion, which involves the removal of pregnancy tissue, products of conception, or the fetus and placenta from the uterus.

In conclusion, Cruz's claim that Democrats support ""abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that"" is inaccurate. The Virginia bill he referenced was unsuccessful, and killing an infant after birth is illegal. The comments made by Governor Northam were about options for care in cases of nonviable pregnancies or severe fetal abnormalities, not about allowing abortions during or after a live birth.
Claim: Ted Cruz Says Democrats are embracing “abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that.”
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Cruz's statement is based on an inaccurate characterization of a bill considered in Virginia's House of Delegates, which would have changed requirements needed before doctors could perform an aboriton during the third-trimester of pregnancy. In Virginia, abortions are allowed at this late point if three physicians certify that a continued pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman. The author of the bill, which was unsuccessful, said her proposed changes would not allow an abortion to be performed on a woman during a live birth. Any attempt at aborting or killing an infant after birth is illegal.","Ted Cruz Says Democrats are embracing “abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that.”","Cruz said Democrats are embracing """"abortion up until the moment of birth and even, horrifically, after that.""""

334,"### Context: After Cyclone Idai hit the Mozambican port city of Beira, thousands of people were trapped in submerged villages without access to clean water. The cyclone caused catastrophic flooding and killed over 700 people across three countries in southeast Africa. Relief efforts have been focused on containing outbreaks of waterborne and infectious diseases, as tens of thousands of displaced people have been moved to makeshift camps.

David Wightwick, a senior member of the World Health Organization's (WHO) response team in Beira, announced that seven clinics had been set up in Mozambique to treat cholera patients, with two more clinics to be ready soon. The WHO has 900,000 doses of oral cholera vaccines arriving on Monday, and a vaccination campaign will begin as soon as possible next week. Cholera is endemic to Mozambique, and the country has experienced regular outbreaks in recent years.

The damage to Beira's water and sanitation infrastructure, combined with its dense population, has raised concerns about the difficulty of containing another epidemic. While Wightwick could not confirm any deaths from cholera in Mozambique, a Reuters reporter witnessed the body of a dead child being brought out of an emergency clinic in Beira, who had suffered from acute diarrhea, a possible symptom of cholera.

In neighboring Malawi, which was severely affected by flooding and heavy rains before Cyclone Idai, the government reported significant damage to arable and livestock farming, as well as irrigation infrastructure. The agriculture ministry estimated that around 420,000 metric tonnes of maize, representing approximately 12 percent of the country's forecast output for the farming season, had been lost. This loss is concerning for Malawi, as the country regularly faces food shortages.

Zimbabwe's Local Government Minister, July Moyo, announced that the government would allocate an additional $18 million to address the aftermath of the cyclone. As of Wednesday, the death toll from the tropical storm and heavy rains in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi had reached 713.

In summary, Mozambique is set to begin cholera vaccinations next week following the devastation caused by Cyclone Idai. The cyclone led to widespread flooding, leaving thousands of people without clean water and raising concerns about the potential for a cholera epidemic. The neighboring countries of Malawi and Zimbabwe also suffered significant damage, with Malawi losing a substantial portion of its maize crop. The death toll across the three countries has reached 713.

335,"### Context: The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is leading the investigation into the crash of a C-130 Hercules tanker plane that killed its entire crew. The cause of the crash is still unknown, and officials are in the evidence gathering phase of the investigation. The ATSB chief commissioner stated that there is currently no evidence to suggest a systemic fault with other aircraft in use. The plane was owned by Canadian firm Coulson Aviation, and all three crew members were former U.S. military members with extensive flight experience. Firefighters in Australia held a minute's silence and flags were flown at half-mast as a mark of respect for the crew. The crash site is being secured by police, and investigators are working to retrieve the plane's black box cockpit voice recorder and analyze air traffic control and plane data. Witnesses to the accident are being interviewed to shed light on the sequence of events. A team from Coulson Aviation is due to arrive in Australia along with the aircraft's history and maintenance records. The company has grounded its other large air tankers but plans to return them to work soon. Previous crashes involving C-130 Hercules aircraft during wildfire fighting have occurred in 2002 and 2012. The cause of Thursday's crash could be due to various factors, including metal fatigue-induced wing failure, reduced visibility, high turbulence, and low flying. The death toll from Australia's bushfires has risen to 33, including eight firefighters. The fires have also killed millions of animals, destroyed thousands of homes, and burned a land area about one-third the size of Germany. Fire conditions have eased in southeastern Australia, but Sydney is experiencing a new smoke haze from fires in the south of the state. Currently, firefighters are tackling 65 blazes in New South Wales, with only one at the ""watch and act"" category, and all 37 fires in Victoria are at the lowest level.

336,"### Context: The claim states that there was a popular food tale in the early 1990s about a woman who ordered a chicken sandwich with no mayo, but when she bit into it, she tasted a sauce that looked like mayo. It is later discovered that the sauce was actually pus from a tumor in the chicken. The article explains that this tale, although widely spread, couldn't have happened as told.

The article argues that fast food chicken sandwiches are made from processed meat, where chicken is ground and reformed into breast-shaped patties. Even if the sandwich was made from a whole chicken breast, it would have to be pounded to fit the bun and prevent it from curving up in the middle. The frying process would also eliminate any pus-filled abscess or tumor. Therefore, the story of a tumor-filled chicken sandwich is not credible.

The article also mentions that in most versions of the tale, a tumor is discovered in the chicken sandwich, not an abscess or a cyst. This further diminishes the credibility of the story because tumors are hard masses of cancerous flesh without pus.

Overall, the article debunks the popular food tale from the early 1990s about a woman finding pus from a tumor in her chicken sandwich. It explains that fast food chicken sandwiches are made in a way that would prevent any pus-filled abscess or tumor from surviving the preparation and frying process. The mention of cancer in the tale adds to the yuck factor and fear associated with fast food, but the article emphasizes that tumors are not filled with pus, further discrediting the story.

337,"### Context: Italian business Fater is aiming to address the environmental problem of disposable diapers by recycling them into high-value building blocks. More than 20 million tonnes of disposable diapers are burned or dumped in landfills globally each year, and the process of collecting, cleaning, and breaking down diapers into their component parts is expensive and challenging. Fater believes it can overcome these obstacles with the support of governments, consumers, and other companies concerned about plastic pollution. The Italian government has made finding circular economy solutions a priority. Fater has developed a process to recycle diapers and extract plastic, cellulose, and super absorbent polymer. Procter & Gamble (P&G), the world's leading diaper maker, is interested in recycling absorbent hygiene products (AHP) and aims to recycle them in 10 cities by 2030. P&G also hopes to use 100% renewable or recycled materials for all its products and packaging in the long term. Fater's diaper recycling operation, located near Venice, has 11 letters of intent from prospective clients, including bioplastic manufacturers and paper mills. The plastic from recycled diapers can be used to make school desks and urban playgrounds, cellulose can become viscose fabric or specialty paper, and super-absorbent polymer can be used in gardening and flood barriers. P&G has not yet decided whether consumers would be willing to pay a premium for recycled diapers, but believes that brands caring about the environment is important to consumers. Fater's plant is currently operating at a third of its annual capacity, but if successful, the project could be expanded. The biggest delay to the project has been regulatory, but P&G predicts it will receive approval from the EU in the next 12 months. The recycling of diapers has been attempted before, but previous efforts failed due to cost and the inability to find markets for the final product. Fater's process involves collecting used diapers from waste management utility Contarina SpA and then dry cleaning them. One ton of AHP waste can yield 150 kg of cellulose, 75 kg of absorbing material, and 75 kg of mixed plastic. A small-scale biorefinery in Amsterdam will be able to process the recovered materials and convert them into biologically-based products. Some critics argue that the best solution is to not create waste in the first place.

It mentions that the cost of the drug has not been determined yet, but notes that many new cancer therapies cost between $5,000 to $7,000 a month. The article quantifies the benefits of the drug, stating that 81% of patients had a partial response, and provides the absolute number of people this represents. It also mentions that the drug is effective in only 50% of advanced melanoma patients with a specific genetic mutation. However, it cautions that a ""sizable proportion"" of patients developed resistance to the drug. The article does not discuss any harms associated with the drug, despite safety assessment being the primary objective of phase I research. The suggestion that the drug may increase the risk of another type of skin cancer is mentioned in an accompanying editorial. The article acknowledges the limitations of the study and the uncertainty regarding the drug's long-term effectiveness. It quotes a dermatologist who points out the lack of conclusive data on survival. The article also notes that the trial was funded by drug maker Roche. It mentions that only about 15% of patients respond to standard treatments for metastatic melanoma. However, it questions the claim that regular skin examinations are the best defense against melanoma, citing guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that state there is insufficient evidence to support this. The article specifies that the new drug is experimental and in phase 1 clinical research, indicating that it is not widely available. It describes the research that led to the development of the drug and highlights its novel approach to treating metastatic melanoma.

339,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests ginger supplements may help reduce inflammation linked to colon cancer. The study found that participants who took ginger supplements for 28 days experienced a 28% decrease in inflammation levels. However, the article raises several concerns about the validity and context of the study's findings.

One concern is the lack of information about the scope and significance of the 28% decrease in inflammation levels. The article questions what this percentage represents and whether it is considered significant. It also highlights the absence of evidence linking the measured inflammation levels to colon cancer development.

The article also raises doubts about the validity of the inflammation level measurements taken in the study. It questions the accuracy and reliability of these measurements, but does not provide further details.

Another concern is the lack of context regarding the potential side effects of ginger supplements. While the article mentions that the National Library of Medicine considers ginger supplements ""likely safe,"" it also notes that some people may experience side effects. However, it does not provide any information about the nature or prevalence of these side effects.

The article also criticizes the headline of the story, which suggests that ginger supplements can ease inflammation linked to colon cancer. It argues that there is no evidence given to support this claim and questions whether all stomach inflammation is linked to colon cancer.

Furthermore, the article highlights the lack of context about other research in the field of inflammation and colon cancer. It suggests that comparing the effects of ginger supplements to aspirin, a common anti-inflammatory product, would be more relevant.

Overall, the article raises concerns about the validity, context, and interpretation of the study's findings. It questions the significance of the decrease in inflammation levels, the link between inflammation and colon cancer, and the potential side effects of ginger supplements.

Right-wing social media users accused Halkett of calling McEnany a ""lying bitch"" based on a clip of the exchange shared on Twitter. However, Halkett herself stated on Twitter that she told McEnany, ""OK, you don't want to engage."" The official White House transcript of the briefing supports Halkett's claim.

The exchange between the two stemmed from a question Halkett asked about President Donald Trump's concerns regarding mail-in voting. Halkett questioned why the President was not addressing concerns about external sabotage, citing a Parliamentary Committee report from the UK that claimed Russia influenced the Scottish referendum and had questions about Brexit. McEnany responded by stating that the President has put the world on notice that election systems must be secure and mentioned his efforts to address foreign election interference.

As Halkett continued to ask about election interference by Russia, McEnany instead cited a Wall Street Journal editorial criticizing mail-in voting in New York City. Halkett tried to redirect the conversation back to foreign interference, but McEnany insisted she read the op-ed.

The article also mentions that McEnany herself has voted by mail in Florida multiple times, despite claiming concerns about mail-in voting. It is unclear whether she would support changing the state law to restrict voting by mail.

The exchange between Halkett and McEnany occurred just hours after Republican Rep. Ted Yoho cursed at Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Capitol. Ocasio-Cortez confirmed the encounter and expressed her disgust at the disrespect she faced.

In summary, the article discusses the allegations that Kimberly Halkett called Kayleigh McEnany a ""lying bitch"" during a press briefing. It highlights the conflicting accounts of the exchange and mentions the broader context of the discussion on mail-in voting and election interference.

However, the article states that there is no evidence that Trump actually tweeted the comment or anything similar. It mentions that no manual retweets or traces of the tweet were found, and a search on ProPublica's Politwoops page did not show any indication of the tweet being deleted.

In conclusion, the article highlights that the screenshot of the purported tweet from President Trump criticizing Obama for his pandemic response and making misspellings and claims is not authentic. There is no evidence that Trump actually tweeted the comment, and the source of the tweet is unknown.

343,"### Context: Donald Trump claimed that 25 percent of U.S. Muslims agree that violence against Americans is justified as part of the global jihad. He cited a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy to support his claim. However, experts have raised concerns about the validity of the poll's results. The poll was an online, opt-in survey, which tends to produce less reliable samples because respondents choose to participate. The survey also asked leading questions with limited response choices. Additionally, the survey found that a large percentage of American Muslims claimed to be unfamiliar with ISIS and al-Qaida, which experts find implausible. The head of the Center for Security Policy, Frank Gaffney, has also made controversial statements about Muslim extremists. In contrast, a 2011 Pew Research study, which used traditional telephone survey methods, found that only 13 percent of American Muslims believe that violence in the name of Islam is justifiable. The Pew study is considered more credible by public-opinion experts. The Center for Security Policy poll does not directly support Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. The poll did not ask whether the U.S. should ban all Muslims, and the organization that conducted the survey did not endorse Trump's proposal. Overall, experts question the validity of the Center for Security Policy poll and find that the results are not representative of the entire Muslim-American community.

The deaths were caused by the hepatitis B vaccine, with four occurring in Guangdong province and the others in Hunan and Sichuan provinces. All hospitals using the vaccine have been ordered to remove it from their shelves while the Health Ministry investigates the company's products and the deaths. BioKangtai stated that it followed safety rules and is currently testing the batches suspected of causing the deaths. The issue has sparked concern among the public, with many questioning the safety of China's vaccines and calling for more transparency from the government. There is a general suspicion that the government tries to cover up health problems, as seen in the 2003 SARS outbreak cover-up.

345,"### Context: Former Mayor Rick Baker claims that he made St. Petersburg the best-maintained large sewer system in the state in 2007. He cites the city's receipt of the Wastewater Collection System Award from the Florida Water Environment Association (FWEA) as evidence of this achievement. However, it is important to note that not every utility in the state applied for this award, so it does not reflect a comprehensive comparison of all sewer systems in Florida. Additionally, other cities like Tampa and Orlando have won awards from different organizations for their water treatment facilities. 

Furthermore, St. Petersburg's improvements to its sewer system were largely driven by consent orders from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) that required changes to be made. These orders were in place throughout Baker's tenure as mayor and were a response to previous sewage spills. The FDEP assessed civil penalties against the city but allowed them to implement programs for environmental enhancement, education, and restoration instead of payment. Baker acknowledges that the city was ordered to improve, but he believes that the improvements made were significant.

During Baker's time as mayor, the city invested in rehabilitating pipes and improving flow velocities, as recommended in the consent orders. However, a draft report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) places some blame for the city's sewage problems on the Baker administration and other past city leadership. The report states that not enough was done to fix leaky pipes that contributed to the sewage issues.

In conclusion, while St. Petersburg did receive the Wastewater Collection System Award in 2007, it is important to note that not every utility in the state applied for this award. The city's improvements to its sewer system were largely driven by consent orders from the FDEP, and outside investigators have placed some blame on the Baker administration for not adequately addressing certain issues with the system.

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Baker said he made St. Petersburg the state's best-maintained large sewer system in 2007. Baker’s evidence is that the Florida Water Environment Association gave St. Petersburg a Wastewater Collection System Award. But the award was hardly a comprehensive comparison of similarly situated cities in the state. Nor is it the only award that recognizes excellence in sewage management. St. Petersburg was under consent orders for Baker’s tenure that required the city to make improvements to the system. Outside investigators looking into the current sewage crisis have put some blame on Baker’s years for not addressing some problems with the system.

346,"### Context: The claim being evaluated is whether a miscarriage is considered an abortion. According to the article, State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr. made a statement suggesting that a miscarriage should not be considered an abortion because it is a natural occurrence. Lucio later clarified that he misspoke and did not intend to suggest that a miscarriage should be considered an abortion.

The article provides information from the Texas Department of State Health Services, which states that miscarriages are sometimes referred to as ""spontaneous abortions,"" but they are not included in annual abortion counts. The legal definition of abortion in Texas also does not include miscarriages.

The Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, states that 15% of pregnancies result in miscarriages. However, miscarriages are not included in abortion statistics, and there is no national effort to track them. The Texas Medical Association confirms that doctors often refer to a miscarriage as a spontaneous abortion because the body itself is aborting the pregnancy.

In summary, the article concludes that while a miscarriage is considered a spontaneous abortion in medical terms, it is not included in abortion statistics and is not considered an elective abortion. Therefore, the claim that ""a miscarriage is considered an abortion"" is not accurate.

347,"### Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that the battle against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa could be set back by 20 years due to the focus on containing the coronavirus. The WHO projects that in a worst-case scenario, 769,000 people could die of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa this year, more than double the deaths in the last count two years ago. This would be the worst figures for the region since 2000. Sub-Saharan Africa is already the worst affected by malaria, accounting for 93% of the world's cases and 94% of deaths in 2018, with the majority of deaths being children under the age of 5.

There have already been disruptions to anti-malaria campaigns and access to medication in Africa due to the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO is urging countries to not lose focus on their gains in health as they tackle the new threat of COVID-19. The organization highlights the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where more people died from malaria than from Ebola, as a cautionary example.

In addition to malaria, immunization campaigns to protect children against diseases like measles, polio, and yellow fever are also being affected globally. More than 24 countries, including South Sudan, Mexico, and Bangladesh, have suspended immunizations, and this number could rise to 37. Over 117 million children may miss out on receiving life-saving vaccines for measles, which has seen a resurgence in recent years. The Democratic Republic of Congo has suspended its immunization program, despite experiencing the world's largest current measles outbreak, which has already claimed over 6,000 lives.

The WHO emphasizes the critical window of opportunity that countries have to minimize disruptions in malaria prevention and treatment, as well as immunization campaigns, to save lives. The organization warns that the coronavirus pandemic could erode the global fight against many diseases, and it is crucial to not repeat the mistakes made during previous outbreaks.

Overall, the WHO is sounding the alarm about the potential setbacks in the fight against malaria and other diseases due to the focus on COVID-19. The organization urges countries to prioritize and maintain efforts to combat these diseases to prevent a significant increase in deaths and suffering.
Claim: Fight against malaria could be set back 20 years, WHO warns.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,One of the hard lessons the World Health Organization learned during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was this: Other diseases can be forgotten and take a deadlier toll.,"Fight against malaria could be set back 20 years, WHO warns.",The World Health Organization warned on Thursday that the fight against malaria could be set back 20 years if countries do not maintain prevention and treatment efforts during the coronavirus pandemic.
348,"### Context: The article addresses the claim that the United States turned down coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization (WHO). It states that there is no evidence to support this claim, as the WHO never offered testing kits to the United States. President Donald Trump confirmed this when asked by a reporter, stating that ""nothing was offered"" and that the test was ""bad.""

The article goes on to explain that the WHO had developed a test based on a German test developed in Berlin. By the end of February, the WHO had purchased and sent materials for 1.4 million tests to over 100 countries. A review from the National University of Singapore found that the German test was ""highly sensitive and specific"" and did not cross-react with other coronaviruses.

Before President Trump made his statement, top officials had already explained that the United States wanted a test that came from American commercial vendors and had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The head of the U.S. Public Health Service, Adm. Brett Giroir, stated that the WHO protocol had not been submitted to the FDA. The head of the White House coronavirus response, Deborah Birx, also mentioned that in a few months, the public would see that other tests used around the world were not as good as the U.S. one. However, it is unclear if Birx was referring to the WHO test, as the White House press office did not provide a comment when asked about it.

The article concludes by stating that President Trump claimed the WHO test was ""bad,"" but no evidence was provided to support this statement. The test was found to produce neither positive nor negative results in the lab, but it is not mentioned if this was due to a flaw in the test or other factors.

In summary, the claim that the WHO coronavirus test was ""a bad test"" is addressed in the article. It clarifies that the WHO never offered testing kits to the United States, and there is no evidence to support the claim that the test was unreliable. The article also highlights that the United States preferred a test from American commercial vendors that had FDA approval.
Claim: The WHO coronavirus test “was a bad test.”
The claim veracity: false

349,"### Context: The article discusses a news release about a study on the effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) in relieving acute back pain and sciatica. The release compares pRF with other treatment options such as CT-guided steroid injections and lumbar disk surgery. However, the article criticizes the release for not including information about the costs of these treatments, as well as the assumption that pRF is less expensive than surgery. It also points out that the terminology used in the release, such as ""minimally invasive,"" can be misleading as it may imply a quick and safe intervention, when in reality, there can be complications such as nerve damage and infection. The article highlights the omission of important information in the release, such as the prevalence and difficulty of treating chronic lower back pain, the funding source of the study, and any conflicts of interest of the authors. It also notes that the release does not clarify if pRF is an experimental therapy or widely available, and fails to explain what is novel about the research. The article criticizes the misleading headline, as the source of back pain is often unknown and a disc herniation may not be the identifiable cause of the pain. Lastly, the article argues that making broad claims based on unpublished data is unjustified.
Claim: Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The main problems with this news release promoting an abstract from a radiology meeting are that it fails to mention the research is unpublished, and there are significant limitations which may well preclude a headline such as: “Pulsed Radiofrequency (pRF) Relieves Acute Back Pain and Sciatica.” The touted benefits of pRF (pulsed energy applied to nerve roots of the spine by a probe) noted in this study are based on difficult-to-reproduce patient questionnaires, and framed with language that makes it very difficult for readers to place in an understandable context. Although alternatives are nicely covered — benefits, costs, availability, and potential harms of the outpatient probe procedure are not. We also reviewed a HealthDay news story about the study. Both the story and news release would have been improved with more discussion about cost, benefits and harms. Chronic back pain that does not respond to conservative treatment, and sometimes includes shooting pain into the buttocks and leg (sciatica), is difficult to treat, a leading cause of disability, and poses a huge economic burden to both individuals and the health care system. Although the search for treatments that are “minimally invasive” are well-intentioned and much needed, this catchphrase can be quite misleading. As we’ve written before, many readers erroneously equate “minimally invasive” with more advanced and effective, and involving fewer complications and recovery time. Rather than prey on this notion, releases should clarify if procedures touted in this way even come close to meeting such expectations. Many back patients have very straightforward questions they need answered: Do I need surgery? If not, what are my alternatives? How effective are those alternatives? What are the benefits vs. risks involved? What will it cost me? Not answering those questions clearly (or making it clear if the answers are unknown) does readers a disservice. Back pain creates tremendous personal, family and economic burdens. In the majority of individuals, the source of the pain cannot be identified, and undoubtedly there are many different causes of back pain. If the source of pain in any individual can be identified accurately, specific interventions may be able to be developed to treat that subset of patients resulting in improved quality of life for those individuals and less economic burden. But it’s also important to keep in mind that in the vast majority of individuals, the pain resolves spontaneously without any residual disability.",Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica,"This news release describes a small, randomized controlled trial of pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) for acute low back pain with or without leg pain (aka sciatica).

350,"### Context: President Trump has announced that he will be meeting with representatives of the vaping industry, medical professionals, and state representatives to find a solution to the vaping and e-cigarette dilemma. The focus of the meeting will be on children's health and safety, as well as job preservation. The president did not provide a specific time for the meeting or any further details. He also stated that his administration will release an important position on vaping this week.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that there have been 2,051 confirmed and probable cases of lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes or vaping products in the United States. Additionally, there have been 39 deaths linked to these products. The majority of lung injury patients in the nationwide outbreak reported using products containing THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana. THC was detected in 23 out of 28 patient samples, including from three patients who claimed not to have used THC products. Nicotine was detected in 16 out of 26 patient samples.

Public health officials in the US have advised people to avoid using e-cigarettes that contain THC or any products from illicit sources. In September, the Trump administration announced that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was working on a guidance document that would lead to a ban on all e-cigarette flavors, except for tobacco flavoring. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stated that enforcement actions would be taken to remove these products from store shelves once the guidance was finalized. President Trump mentioned that a flavor ban is still being considered, along with other actions such as raising the age limit for e-cigarette purchases.

It is unclear whether Juul Labs Inc, the dominant player in the US e-cigarette market, will participate in the discussions. A spokesperson for Juul stated that the company is not lobbying on the issue and is instead focusing on combating underage use and converting adult smokers.

352,"### Context: The claim that once a woman enters into the sex trade, her average life expectancy is seven years is not supported by evidence. The claim has been echoed on various websites and in discussions, but it is not based on any reliable data. A 2004 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that examined the lives of female prostitutes in Colorado Springs found that fewer than 8 percent died over a period of three decades. The authors of the study stated that there is no basis for the claim of a seven-year life expectancy for sex workers. They emphasized that while prostitution is a dangerous profession, the risk of death faced by sex workers is higher than that of other women, particularly in terms of homicide. The study estimated that the women they studied faced a 1 percent chance of being murdered during their prostitution career. Another false statistic that has been circulated is that prostitutes typically die around age 34. However, this statistic is based on the average age of the 21 prostitutes in the study who were murdered, not the average life expectancy of all sex workers. The FBI has also been cited as a source for the claim, but the agency repudiated the statistic and stated that it may have come from a specific case they handled, not a general finding. The FBI's budget report only deals with child prostitution and does not provide any documentation for the claim. While it is true that prostitution can be a dangerous profession, the claim of a seven-year life expectancy is not supported by evidence.

353,"### Context: According to an expert analysis in JAMA Cardiology, the timely use of Novartis' drug Entresto could prevent or postpone over 28,000 deaths per year among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in the US. The analysis is based on the results of the PARADIGM-HF trial and published heart failure statistics. 

The article mentions that the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) warned in a draft report that the current price of Entresto is too high and could overwhelm the health system if widely used. The drug is estimated to cost about $4,600 per year for a typical patient. ICER's value-based price benchmark for Entresto is $3,779 annually, a 17% discount off the list price. 

The release does not provide specific information on the comparative cost between Entresto and other medications, nor does it quantify what it means when it says the drug is ""cost-effective."" The release mentions that Entresto does not save money over the long term but its added costs are well-aligned with the degree of benefit it brings to patients. 

The release provides information on the benefits of Entresto, stating that it could avert 59.7 heart failure hospital admissions per year for every 1,000 patients treated compared to enalapril. It also mentions that Entresto increased life expectancy at a cost-effectiveness ratio consistent with other high-value cardiovascular interventions. However, the release does not provide actual figures or percentages to back up the cost-effectiveness claim.

The release includes information on the side effects of Entresto, including serious allergic reactions that may cause trouble breathing and death. It also mentions that the analysis used data from a previous trial to model health outcomes and cost-effectiveness over a 30-year period. However, the release does not discuss possible limitations of the analysis or address issues mentioned in the study that could affect the findings.

The article notes that there is no disease mongering in the release, but it acknowledges the conflict of interest as the release is from the manufacturer of Entresto. It would have been better if the release had identified that the principal author of the study receives grant support from Novartis and several other authors are employees of Novartis.

Overall, the article highlights the potential benefits of Entresto in preventing or postponing deaths among HFrEF patients but raises concerns about the drug's high cost and its impact on the healthcare system.
Claim: Timely use of Novartis' Entresto could prevent or postpone over 28,000 US deaths per year among HFrEF patients, according to an expert analysis in JAMA Cardiology
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This news release summarizes a study that estimated the benefits of sacubitril/valsartan (marketed as Entresto) vs enalapril (an ACE-inhibitor) in treating heart failure patients with lowered ejection fraction (the amount of blood pumped from the heart). In the study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology, researchers created a statistical model that estimated that about 28,000 patients per year with heart failure and a lowered ejection fraction could benefit from Entresto, a twice-daily pill approved in 2015. The model found that patients on Entresto lived a year longer, on average, than those treated with enalapril, and that the medication was “cost effective” when used with concurrent standard therapies. The release from the drugmaker, Novartis, describes their complex analysis and highlights their conclusion that the heart failure medication is cost effective. But the release does not include any discussion of the extremely high cost of the drug. An estimated 6 million people in the United States have heart failure, and about half of those with heart failure also have reduced ejection fraction, so any treatment for them matters for their individual health and for society’s costs of overall health treatment. The release states that the analysis reinforces a strong recommendation from several medical societies that the condition be treated with sacubitril/valsartan. This release about the statistical model of effectiveness for the drug Entresto claims that it could delay or prevent thousands of deaths per year, but does not include analysis that the total cost of treating the majority of those eligible could drastically tax the health system. A 2015 story in Kaiser Health News reports on a nonprofit analysis that raised questions about the cost-effectiveness of Entresto.","Timely use of Novartis' Entresto could prevent or postpone over 28,000 US deaths per year among HFrEF patients, according to an expert analysis in JAMA Cardiology","This news release from Novartis promotes a study published in JAMA Cardiology that used a mathematical model to estimate the impact of Novartis’ drug Entresto on heart failure deaths and hospitalizations.

354,"### Context: The article discusses the potential dangers of black and white caterpillars, specifically the White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillar. The caterpillar is native to Canada and the United States and is known for its long white hairs that can embed in the skin and release a type of chemical defense upon contact. While the caterpillar is not technically poisonous, it can cause an allergic reaction in some individuals.

Most people who come into contact with the caterpillar will experience a mild to moderate itchy rash. Washing the affected area with soap and water, applying ammonia or calamine lotion, and icing the area can help alleviate the symptoms. However, some people may be hypersensitive to the caterpillar's venom and experience more severe symptoms such as swelling and nausea. These individuals should seek medical advice as soon as possible.

The caterpillar appears between June and September and feeds on the leaves of deciduous trees, particularly nut-bearing trees. While it can cause damage to the leaves, it does not typically harm the trees themselves. The caterpillar's hairs are long and bristle-like, and two sharp black hairs near the front and rear of the creature are connected to poison glands that excrete venom on contact.

In conclusion, black and white caterpillars, specifically the White Hickory Tussock Moth Caterpillar, can cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals who touch them.

355,"### Context: On 4 March 2017, several dubious news outlets reported that a Japanese man was killed when a six-ton pile of porn he had amassed in his apartment fell and crushed him. While it is true that a Japanese man died in his apartment amidst tons of pornography, the Japanese news website Nikkan Spa!, originally reported that he actually died of a heart attack. Further, despite reports that the man was not found for six months after his death, the Nikkan-Spa! simply reported that the unidentified man’s body was found a month later. Gruesomely, the story notes that the pornography soaked up his “body fluids,” which would normally cause an odor and alert neighbors of his death. “Although it is nightmare talk, this is reality,” the article says. The phenomenon of solitary deaths, or kodokushi, has been a concern in Japan since at least 2005:  According to the Japan Quality of Life Survey, conducted in 2013 by the Japanese government’s Economic and Social Research Institute, 32% of respondents reported that they were somewhat or very concerned about dying alone. According to our own analysis of the data, the worries are negatively correlated with subjective well-being. Worries about solitary death show one of the highest negative correlations with happiness.

However, the article’s claim that a man was crushed to death by a pile of pornography is not supported by any other news reports."
356,"### Context: The article discusses various aspects of the Health Care Reform Bill, including the different versions of the bill that were passed by Congress. It mentions that the Senate passed the ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"" in December 2009, and the House version of the bill is HR-3590. It also mentions that an additional package, HR-4872, was posted by the House on March 18, 2010, containing fixes to the Healthcare bill. The article states that the Republican Party, after winning majority control of Congress in November 2010, promised to repeal Obamacare and voted in favor of repealing the bill in January 2011. However, the bill still needed to go to the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid vowed to block it.

The article also addresses various rumors and opinions about the Health Care Reform Bill. It mentions that there is a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, which went into effect in January 2013. It clarifies that the tax is paid by the manufacturer or importer of the device, not the consumer. The article also discusses a 3.8% tax on capital gains, which was included in the bill to help fund the new Health Care Bill. It states that the tax applies to individuals with an adjusted gross income above $200,000 and couples filing a joint return with more than $250,000 AGI.

The article addresses rumors about the Affordable Care Act's impact on aspirin and over-the-counter medications. It clarifies that while there is a medicine cabinet tax in Obamacare that bars the use of pre-tax funds from Health Savings Accounts to purchase over-the-counter medicines, there is no specific tax on aspirin.

The article also mentions that the Health Care Reform Bill includes provisions for mandatory end-of-life counseling, but this provision was excluded from the bill by the Senate. It addresses concerns about rationing and euthanasia, stating that these are not mentioned in the bill and are separate issues from hospice care.

The article concludes by mentioning various other rumors and concerns about the bill, such as government access to personal finances and the restriction of enrollment for special needs people. It states that these claims were under investigation at the time the bill was abandoned.

357,"### Context: A new blood test has been developed that may be able to predict cardiovascular events in patients, even if they have normal cholesterol levels and no evidence of heart blockages. The test measures levels of a molecule called ceramide in the blood. A study found that individuals with high levels of ceramide were 3-4 times more likely to have a cardiovascular event compared to those with low levels, regardless of their LDL cholesterol levels or the presence of blockages in the heart's arteries. However, it is important to note that among individuals with low LDL and high ceramide levels, 83.6% did not experience cardiovascular disease. The cost of the blood test is not mentioned in the news release.

The news release raises concerns about the potential for overtreatment if the blood test reveals high ceramide levels. It is not clear what individuals can do to reduce their ceramide levels, and it is uncertain if changes in treatment based on the test results would produce measurable benefits for patients. The research discussed in the news release was presented at a scientific conference and had not yet undergone peer review, which raises questions about the reliability of the findings.

The news release mentions that the study was funded by Mayo Clinic and that the ceramide test is available through Mayo Medical Laboratories. This potential conflict of interest is noted. The news release does not mention that many new blood tests for refining cardiac risk have been researched in recent years, and independent expert guidelines do not endorse their use. It is unclear if the ceramide test is the only commercially available test of its kind.

Overall, the news release provides information about the potential benefits and risks of the blood ceramide test, but there are some important details missing. The cost of the test is not mentioned, and there is no data comparing the risks of cardiovascular events for individuals with low LDL cholesterol, no blockages, and high ceramide levels to those with high LDL cholesterol levels and/or evidence of blockages. The news release also does not provide information about how individuals can reduce their ceramide levels or if changes in treatment based on the test results would be beneficial.
Claim: New blood test may predict cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease, research shows
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The news release reports on research suggesting that testing for plasma ceramides, a type of blood lipid, might enable doctors to identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage. It provides a readable and reasonably straightforward account of what the researchers did and why it might be important, but there are a number of significant omissions. First, the release should have acknowledged that this test — even if it does effectively identify individuals at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke — may not lead to treatment that actually lowers that risk. Knowing about an increased risk doesn’t mean that risk can be reduced. Many other similar risk markers have been proposed over the years and so far haven’t been found very useful for actually guiding treatment that improves outcomes. Moreover, the research discussed in the release was being presented at a scientific meeting, meaning it has not yet gone through the peer-review process for publication in a journal. In addition, the news release provides no information about the costs of the new test, which appears to be available only through Mayo Medical Laboratories. It also does not discuss the possibility of false positive results, potentially leading to unnecessary treatment. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, kills more Americans than any other disease, including cancer. Although health experts have long advised people to try to maintain low cholesterol levels – especially for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) – research suggests that as many as half of all heart attacks occur in individuals who have normal cholesterol levels. In addition, heart attacks can occur in individuals, especially women, for whom angiograms show no blockage of the coronary arteries.","New blood test may predict cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease, research shows","This news release describes a study that found a blood test for a molecule called ceramide could be used to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease in people who have normal cholesterol levels and no evidence of heart blockages. The release does a good job of describing the potential benefits of the test, as well as the potential harms. However, it doesn’t provide enough information about the study itself, such as the size of the study population, the range of ceramide levels found in the blood, and the actual risk of cardiovascular disease in people with high ceramide levels. The release also doesn’t mention that the study was presented at a scientific meeting and has not yet undergone peer review. The release would have been stronger if it had included this information. The release also would have been stronger if it had mentioned that many new blood tests for refining cardiac risk have been researched in recent years.

358,"### Context: A recent study has found that chondroitin, a popular supplement used to treat osteoarthritis, is no better than a placebo in relieving pain. The study analyzed three of the largest and most complete studies on chondroitin and found that the effect of the supplement on pain was extremely small, equivalent to an improvement of 0.6 millimeters on a 10-centimeter scale. The study also noted that there were no side effects from taking chondroitin. The article mentions that Americans spent $810 million on chondroitin supplements in 2005, but does not provide information on the cost of purchasing the pills. The study's authors illustrate the non-difference between chondroitin and placebo nicely with this data. The article also highlights the limitations and flaws of the other 17 studies that the researchers did not analyze, including small sample sizes, inconsistent results, and failure to conceal whether patients received chondroitin or placebo. The article does not engage in disease mongering and acknowledges that osteoarthritis is an important and often painful disease. It includes quotes from the lead author of the study, a spokesperson for a trade group for supplement makers, and an editorial in the journal that published the research. The article mentions that chondroitin is a dietary supplement and is available in stores that sell supplements. It also notes that glucosamine, often used in combination with chondroitin, is another treatment option for osteoarthritis. However, the article neglects to mention other nonoperative strategies for managing arthritis pain, such as analgesics, exercise, physical therapy, and assistive devices. The article does not appear to rely solely or largely on a news release.
Claim: Chondroitin of little help for arthritis, study says
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This succinct story – only 348 words – nicely captures the main message of new research showing that the nutritional supplement chondroitin is no better at relieving arthritis pain than placebo. It includes good sources and makes clear that chondroitin, though not proven to be effective, is also not harmful. But the story might help the reader evaluate the evidence if it explained a little more. For example, the authors of the analysis found that the effect of chondroitin on pain was equivalent to an improvement of 0.6 millimeters on a 10-centimeter scale—extremely tiny. This piece of data would have provided readers with a quantifiable estimate of non-efficacy. The story also neglects to note that there are other nonsurgical therapies that can help. Though there is no cure-all for osteoarthritis, conservative care include analgesics, exercise and physical therapy, devices such as canes and braces, and other strategies.","Chondroitin of little help for arthritis, study says",This is a story about a recent study that found that the dietary supplement chondroitin is no better than a placebo in relieving the pain of osteoarthritis.

The story also does a good job of describing the limitations and flaws of the other 17 studies that the researchers did not analyze. The story would have been improved by including more of this information.
359,"### Context: A group of scientists spent several weeks diving with whale sharks in the Galapagos Islands in an attempt to solve some of the mysteries surrounding these creatures. Whale sharks are sharks, not whales, and they can grow to be bigger than a double-decker bus. They are filter feeders and pose no danger to humans. They have broad, flat heads and their bodies are covered in dots that act as camouflage underwater. Whale sharks are endangered due to overhunting by fishermen. They prefer warm waters and can be found feeding in various locations around the world. Marine biologists have been tagging whale sharks to track their movements and answer questions about their life and reproductive cycles. An international database has been launched to identify whale sharks through their distinctive dot patterns. The Galapagos Islands are one of the few places where pregnant whale sharks are regularly seen. Most of the sharks identified in the Galapagos are female and many have a swollen abdomen, suggesting they are pregnant. The researchers obtained two blood samples from the whale sharks, but they have not been tested yet. The ultrasound exams were inconclusive and more powerful machines are needed. Scientists successfully tagged seven sharks, which is important since so few whale sharks are tracked. The pressure of deep water can cause tags to drop off, but any migratory data collected when sharks stay at shallower depths can help build a picture of their life cycle. The researchers are planning further expeditions to the Galapagos to continue their research. The conservation of whale sharks is important as their numbers are dropping due to hunting and climate change could further harm them by reducing their food supply.

360,"### Context: The article titled ""Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain"" discusses a study that compared the effectiveness of yoga and stretching in treating chronic back pain. The journalist adequately quantified the benefits of both interventions in terms of primary and secondary outcome measures. However, the article did not mention the costs or cost-effectiveness of these interventions, which is an important issue as individuals may have to bear the costs themselves.

The article also did not discuss adverse events in any of the groups, despite the study reporting on them. This is significant because many people with back pain avoid exercise programs due to fear of worsening their symptoms. The study primarily focused on subjects with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated chronic back pain, so it is unclear if the results apply to individuals with more severe back pain.

There was no obvious disease mongering in the article, as chronic back pain is a legitimate concern for the general public. However, the article would have benefited from additional expert input, considering the complexity of the evidence on chronic back pain and the effectiveness of yoga and stretching.

The article did not mention any conflicts-of-interest from the authors of the clinical trial, so there was no need to report on this criterion. While the article mentioned several potential therapies for chronic back pain, it did not discuss a full range of alternative treatments.

The writer assumed that yoga classes and stretching programs are widely available across the United States, but it is not clear if similar programs are accessible in most communities or covered by health insurance plans.

The article did not discuss the novelty of the treatment interventions. The intensive stretching class used in the study appears to be a novel intervention developed specifically for the trial, and similar programs may not be widely available. The ""viniyoga"" program may be less novel but is still distinctive.

Lastly, the article did not rely on a news release from Group Health in Seattle, which released a lengthy press release on the study. The New York Times article did not appear to use this press release as a source.

In summary, the article adequately described the study and its results but lacked information on costs, adverse events, limitations, expert input, and the availability of the interventions.
Claim: Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions. The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions—that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention. But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling. So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems. Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows. The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities—and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn’t have access to this intervention. Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to “usual care”. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States. In the United States, back pain is the ninth most expensive medical condition for women, and the 10th for men, in terms of direct medical costs—with chronic back pain accounting for a disproportionate chunk of those expenses. And the costs of work absence and disability claims related to back pain vastly exceed the medical price tag. Though Americans spend almost $35 billion per year on the medical treatment of back pain, the prevalence of chronic back pain appears to be rising—and self-rated spinal health among Americans appears be declining. (See Soni, 2011; Freburger et al., 2008; and Martin et al., 2008). A number of nonsurgical treatments—analgesics, exercise, manual therapies, complementary/alternative therapies, psychological interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation—are modestly effective in the management of chronic back pain. Yet for various reasons, Americans overuse ineffective treatments and underuse effective ones. (See Carey et al., 2009). So the identification of treatments that facilitate recovery and are popular with patients is a key social and medical priority.

361,"### Context: On September 20, 2019, millions of students and workers around the world participated in a coordinated protest to demand action on climate change. The protests began in the Pacific islands, where rising sea levels pose a threat to their way of life, and spread across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. The protests culminated in New York City's Wall Street, where massive crowds gathered to hear Greta Thunberg, a prominent figure in the climate movement, speak.

Thunberg, who sailed across the Atlantic in an emissions-free yacht, addressed the crowd and emphasized the importance of taking action. She stated that if others refuse to act, the protesters will continue to make a difference and bring about change. Thunberg has become an icon for the younger generation and has played a significant leadership role in the international movement to reduce fossil fuel consumption.

The protests were not limited to New York City. Demonstrators in Paris raised a painting of Thunberg as the Virgin Mary, symbolizing the urgency of the climate crisis. In Brazil, thousands of people gathered to protest President Jair Bolsonaro's environmental policies, which they believe are contributing to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Similar protests took place in Thailand, Germany, Poland, and other countries, with activists using creative methods to draw attention to the issue.

The protests come at a time when concern about climate change is escalating, particularly due to the actions of leaders like U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who question the science of climate change and have taken steps to dismantle environmental protections. Trump recently blocked stricter vehicle emissions standards in California, while Bolsonaro has been accused of allowing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest for economic gain.

The global protest movement is putting pressure on governments and companies to respond to the climate crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a new climate protection package, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledged to make his company net carbon neutral by 2040. Workers from Google, Amazon, and other technology companies also joined the protests, criticizing their industry for being slow to address climate change.

Overall, the protests demonstrate the widespread concern about the environment and the urgent need for action to combat climate change.

362,"### Context: India has banned the sale and import of e-cigarettes, citing concerns about the rising popularity of vaping among young people. The ban has affected users nationwide and has also impacted international companies like Juul Labs Inc and Philip Morris International. Local firms have filed court challenges against the ban. However, a recent protest organized by the Association of Vapers India saw a low turnout, with only about 400 people participating across six cities. Some opponents of the ban feared being targeted by the police. At one protest in New Delhi, several people were seen using vaping devices, including a child holding a poster that read, ""I don't want my dad to be a smoker.""

The government argues that the ban is necessary to protect people from nicotine addiction and to prevent users from transitioning to tobacco consumption. On the other hand, vapers argue that e-cigarettes help them stay away from more harmful tobacco cigarettes. India has the second-highest number of adult smokers in the world, with 106 million smokers, making it a potentially lucrative market for companies selling both tobacco and vaping products. The government estimates that over 900,000 people die each year in India due to tobacco-related illnesses.

Despite protests and court challenges, an Indian health ministry official stated that there would be no rollback of the ban. Two court challenges in Kolkata, including one by e-cigarette importer Plume Vapour, are currently underway and could potentially impact the enforcement of the ban. Plume Vapour argues that the ban will benefit cigarette companies while putting e-cigarette firms out of business.

A protester in New Delhi expressed concerns about running out of vape refills after stocking up ahead of the ban. They called for regulation rather than a complete ban, stating that ""everybody has an addiction.""

363,"### Context: According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from March 18-24, U.S. men are taking the coronavirus less seriously than women. The poll, which surveyed nearly 4,500 American adults, found that women are more likely to support aggressive measures to combat the virus and take personal precautions such as avoiding physical contact and washing their hands more frequently. The gender gap is consistent across different races, political affiliations, and community types.

The poll revealed that 54% of women are ""very concerned"" about the virus, compared to 45% of men. Women are also more likely to make significant changes to their daily routines, with 73% reporting increased handwashing and disinfectant use, compared to 60% of men. Additionally, 72% of women are avoiding large public gatherings, which is 14 percentage points higher than men, and 65% of women are avoiding close physical contact with others, which is 9 points higher than men.

The article suggests that women may be more concerned about the virus because they are often responsible for ""kinkeeping,"" such as checking on the health of parents and grandparents. Women also tend to do more childcare, so the closure of schools has a greater impact on them.

When asked about the actions the U.S. government should take to slow the spread of the virus, women were more likely than men to support aggressive restrictions such as nighttime curfews, bans on public gatherings, and halting public transportation and overseas flights. For example, 58% of women supported closing all public schools, compared to 52% of men.

The poll also found that a significant minority of men are more dismissive of the potential harm of the virus. 25% of men strongly agree that people are ""unnecessarily panicking,"" compared to 18% of women. Men are also more likely to believe that the media is creating panic about something that isn't a big deal for most people.

The article concludes by highlighting personal anecdotes that illustrate the differing attitudes between men and women. Some women have expressed frustration with their partners' lack of concern and failure to take necessary precautions.

Overall, the poll suggests that U.S. men are less likely to heed health warnings and take the coronavirus seriously compared to women.

364,"### Context: A recent article titled ""Gene therapy raises hope for a future AIDS cure"" discusses a new approach to gene therapy that has shown promising results in treating HIV. The article emphasizes the importance of providing specific details on the trial subjects' cell counts and the timeframe in which changes occurred. However, it also acknowledges that it is too early to determine if these lab results will translate into improvements in patients' lives. The article quotes a member of the conference program committee who states that it is still unknown if there is any antiviral activity resulting from the experiments.

The article mentions that the only side effect observed in the study was two days of flu-like symptoms, but it notes that longer-term safety is still being evaluated. It also highlights the fact that all six patients involved in the study had well-controlled HIV, making it impossible to determine if there would be a therapeutic effect. Additionally, the article points out that another presentation at the same conference revealed that a similar process in mouse research showed a protective effect that wore off over time. The article suggests that including this information would have made the report more comprehensive.

The article emphasizes that the research was published only as a short abstract and presented at a scientific conference, meaning it has not undergone rigorous peer review like a journal article would. It commends the absence of disease mongering in the article and notes that several independent sources were quoted. The article explains that this gene therapy approach is the first to permanently delete a human gene and infuse the altered cells back into patients, as previous attempts focused on adding or suppressing gene activity and were not effective against HIV.

The article concludes by stating that the report is very preliminary and mentions that a second federally-funded study is expected to be released soon. It also highlights that the story did not rely solely on a news release for information.

Overall, the article discusses the potential of gene therapy in treating HIV but emphasizes the need for caution due to the early stage of the research and the lack of long-term data.
Claim: Gene therapy raises hope for a future AIDS cure
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Our one criticism is for the headline writer, who had to frame it as “hope for a future AIDS cure” despite these caveats in the body of the story:  It’s far too early to know if this scientific first will prove to be a cure, or even a new treatment. The research was only meant to show that, so far, it seems feasible and safe. A researcher “warned that it would be ‘way overstated’ to suggest that the results so far are a possible cure”  A competing MedPage Today story had this headline: “HIV-Resistant T Cells on Horizon.” That story said that the researchers “cautioned reporters not to use the word “cure” at this early stage. But this AP story still used the word “cure” 12 times. It is possible to report on very preliminary research – even involving only six people – and even on a topic like HIV/AIDS – and to do so in a reasonable way. This story achieved that goal – despite the repeated use of “cure”.",Gene therapy raises hope for a future AIDS cure,"This is a story about a very preliminary study of a new approach to gene therapy for HIV.

365,"### Context: The article discusses the rumors and misinformation surrounding the death of Beth Chapman, the wife of Duane ""Dog"" Chapman from the reality TV show ""Dog the Bounty Hunter."" The claim states that Beth Chapman died in April 2019.

In September 2017, Beth Chapman revealed that she had been diagnosed with Stage 2 throat cancer. She underwent surgery and recovered, with the family announcing in November 2017 that she was cancer-free. However, her cancer returned a year later, and she underwent emergency surgery to clear a throat blockage obstructing her airways.

On April 7, 2019, it was confirmed that Beth Chapman had been hospitalized due to a buildup of fluid in her lungs. Several websites and social media pages created clickbait and rumors about her passing. A YouTube video with a confusing title and thumbnail image generated over 1.5 million views, leading some people to believe that she had died. However, she was hospitalized and later released, as confirmed by a lawyer for the Chapman family.

Despite the rumors, Beth Chapman continued to post updates regularly on social media. On April 14, 2019, she posted a picture of herself on Instagram with the statement, ""Don't forget the reason for the season."" On April 20, 2019, another misleading article appeared on a website claiming that Beth Chapman had died. However, the article's headline question, ""Did Beth Chapman Die from Dog the Bounty Hunter?"" was answered misleadingly by referencing a different question from the body of the text.

The article concludes by stating that Beth Chapman did indeed pass away in April 2019. However, it does not provide any further details or information about her death.

366,"### Context: A study conducted in Washington State's King County, which includes Seattle, found that calorie information on menus influenced dining habits, particularly for women, higher-income individuals, and diners who ate at fast-food chains. The study, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and published in the American Journal of Public Health, surveyed over 3,000 King County residents who frequented chain restaurants. The research began eight months before the county required restaurants to post calorie information in 2009 and continued for two years after. The study confirmed that posting calorie information led to more people seeing and using it. However, the researchers did not ask how diners utilized the calorie information. 

The study builds on previous research funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which examined receipts from over 7,300 King County restaurant customers. This earlier study found that patrons, especially women, who saw the calorie counts purchased fewer calories compared to those who did not. King County was the second jurisdiction in the United States, after New York City, to implement calorie counts under a menu-labeling law. 

Overall, the findings from this study contribute to the growing body of data on how calorie disclosures on menus can impact dining habits. It suggests that calorie information is more likely to be seen and used by women, higher-income individuals, and those who eat at fast-food chains. Additionally, white, higher-income, and obese customers were more likely to view the calorie information. However, the study does not provide specific details on how diners utilized the calorie information.

Many people in affected areas have refused vaccinations due to mistrust of first responders and misinformation spread by community leaders. Instead, they turn to traditional healers, whose clinics have contributed to the spread of the disease. Tshisekedi emphasized that Ebola is not an imaginary disease and stated that if people follow instructions, the outbreak could be finished in two or three months. The current Ebola outbreak, which began in August 2018, has seen 1,264 confirmed and probable cases and 814 deaths. It is the second largest outbreak in history, surpassed only by the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa. The current outbreak is spreading at its fastest rate yet, with over 100 cases confirmed last week. Tshisekedi also called for the disarmament of militia groups operating in the east, as their presence has complicated the Ebola response. He stated that the time of armed groups is over and urged them to surrender their arms through disarmament programs.

The claim states that the article does not discuss the cost of the treatment, but mentions that it is given along with intensive therapy. The article also mentions the results of a clinical trial where slightly more than half of the participants reported major reductions in PTSD symptoms. However, the article could have emphasized that the drug is proposed for use as part of an intensive therapy program, with doses given only a few times and under professional supervision. The article acknowledges the potential harms of MDMA but does not provide much information about the nature and quality of the existing studies. It mentions that existing drug treatments for PTSD fail two-thirds of patients and compares the rates of PTSD in US and British soldiers. The article suggests that the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is funding the clinical trials on which an FDA assessment of MDMA's efficacy will be based, but it could have been more overt about this funding support. The article mentions other drugs and therapies for PTSD but states that they are deemed seriously flawed. It also highlights that the FDA has not yet approved the use of MDMA and that large-scale clinical trials are needed. The article cautions against using the street version of MDMA, called Ecstasy, due to potential harmful contaminants. It mentions that small clinical studies on the impact of MDMA on PTSD have been ongoing for years and that the recent FDA classification of MDMA as a ""breakthrough therapy"" has put it on a faster track for review. Overall, the article provides information about the potential use of MDMA as a therapy for PTSD but could have provided more details about the cost, nature of the studies, and the stance of experts on the issue.
Claim: Ecstasy could be ‘breakthrough’ therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Post-traumatic stress disorder is difficult to treat. Over the course of the past decade, evidence has been accumulating that the compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as ecstasy, may be more effective than current drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil. This story, jump-started by a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration to classify MDMA as a “breakthrough drug,” which allows it to be evaluated and possibly approved more quickly, offers the reader a well-written account of the evolution of MDMA from a bad actor to a potentially efficacious one. An important element of the narrative is the dominant role of a nonprofit organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is dedicated to ending government bans on psychedelic substances and marijuana and has funded virtually all of the extant research on MDMA’s impact on PTSD sufferers. While the story is well-sourced, the text fails to explore this conflict of interest. It also may land too heavily on the side of “probable” rather than “possible.” The headline—Ecstasy could be “breakthrough” therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD—is worded conditionally but clearly heralds the dawn of a new age. Given the long clinical trial road ahead, despite MDMA’s “breakthrough” status designation, much could change. The substance MDMA may meet all evidentiary challenges and emerge at some point in the future as an effective part of the treatment regimen for PTSD. But drumming up enthusiasm for the drug before it is officially available, as this story may do, runs the risk of sending PTSD sufferers to a less safe—and certainly illegal—form: Ecstasy.","Ecstasy could be ‘breakthrough’ therapy for soldiers, others suffering from PTSD","The story does a good job of explaining the potential harms of MDMA, and of cautioning readers not to try the street version of the drug, known as Ecstasy. The story could have been more clear about the nature and quality of the existing studies, and about the fact that the FDA has not yet approved the use of MDMA. The story also could have been more overt about the fact that the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is funding the clinical trials on which an FDA assessment of MDMA’s efficacy will be based. The story also could have been more clear about the fact that the story is reporting on a recent development, the FDA’s classification of MDMA as a “breakthrough therapy,” which has put it on a faster track for review.

The story also could have been more clear about the fact that the results of the clinical trials are not yet conclusive.

369,"### Context: The claim that Event 201 gave out stuffed souvenir coronavirus toys to commemorate the Novel coronavirus outbreak is false. The toy in question is actually a plushie representing a microbe, and it was distributed two months before the first cases of the current coronavirus outbreak appeared. Event 201, organized by the John Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was a simulation exercise held in October 2019 to plan for a global pandemic. The scenario simulated a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to humans, leading to a severe pandemic. The purpose of the event was to bring together business, government, and public health leaders to inform cooperation for pandemic preparedness and response.

The plushie toys were given out as part of the registration for the event, which aimed to prepare for a new coronavirus pandemic based on the history of previous outbreaks. They were not intended to commemorate the toll that the actual outbreak would bring. The John Hopkins Center for Health Security tweeted a picture of the stuffed microbe as part of its Event 201 registration drive, encouraging people to register for the virtual pandemic exercise.

The organizers of Event 201 did not have insider knowledge about the current coronavirus outbreak. They explicitly stated that the scenario they simulated was not a prediction of the outbreak. The purpose of the simulation was to address the need for pandemic preparedness and response, as there are an average of 200 epidemics that occur annually.

In conclusion, the claim that Event 201 gave out stuffed souvenir coronavirus toys to commemorate the Novel coronavirus outbreak is false. The plushie toys were meant to represent a microbe and were distributed as part of the registration for the event, which aimed to prepare for a new coronavirus pandemic based on historical outbreaks.

370,"### Context: The article confirms that the claim made by Robert Reich, former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton, is essentially correct. The article analyzed statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and found that the ratio of corporate profits to wages in 2010 was higher than any year back to at least 1929. The next highest ratio was in 2006. The article also looked at total compensation and found that the ratio in 2010 was matched or exceeded in only four years. The article further states that the ratio has continued to rise in the last six quarters. 

The article explains that the ratio can rise either because corporate profits rise or because wages stagnate. In the case of 2010 and 2011, both of these developments have happened simultaneously, leading to the sudden increase in the ratio. The article suggests that businesses are reluctant to invest their profits due to economic uncertainty and the threat of more taxes and regulations. However, the general pattern of the ratio following other recent recessions suggests that businesses tend to gain ground faster than workers during the recovery phase, pushing the ratio higher. 

The article concludes that while the current increase in the ratio may be temporary, Reich's claim is factually supportable. The article also commends Reich for not over-promising on what the data indicate and giving an appropriately cautious interpretation. The article suggests that once a strong recovery is underway and labor markets return to normal, total labor compensation tends to rise rapidly relative to total income.
Claim: The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression.

371,"### Context: Data compiled by the United Nations (UN) shows slow progress and even regression in child wasting, stunting, and other malnutrition-related issues in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite economic growth, worsening inequality means that incomes are not increasing fast enough to ensure adequate nutrition for the millions still living in poverty. The UN report calls for governments to combine efforts to end poverty and implement nutrition, health, and education-oriented policies. The UN's sustainable development goals for 2030 aim to end hunger and ensure access to food throughout the year for all people. However, progress in reducing undernourishment has slowed in recent years.

In the Asia-Pacific region, over a fifth of the population faces moderate to severe food insecurity, meaning they must scrimp on food or go hungry for part of the year, and in extreme cases, go days without eating. South Asia has over half of the 479 million undernourished people in the region, with more than a third of children suffering from chronic malnutrition. India has a particularly acute form of malnutrition, with nearly 21% of children suffering from wasting.

The report emphasizes that failing to ensure children are well-nourished jeopardizes their future development, especially their cognitive abilities. Cognitive abilities are crucial in the 21st century age of advanced technologies, and investing in the first 1,000 days of a child's life is the most important investment for future productivity.

Some governments in the region have begun implementing policies to address the severe shortfalls in child and maternal nutrition. Thailand has provided subsidies to improve the health and diets of families with young children. Myanmar is expanding trial programs to cover more of the country, focusing on improving awareness about nutrition, family planning, and water and sanitation. Cambodia is expanding a program called NOURISH, which provides assistance to impoverished pregnant women and families during the first 1,000 days of a baby's life. The program has shown a nearly 20% decrease in stunting and improved toddlers' diets.

While many in Asia still do not receive enough calories to thrive, the Pacific islands face the opposite problem of too many empty calories. Obesity rates in the Pacific islands are among the highest in the world, partly due to the high cost and limited availability of healthy foods, as well as cultural emphasis on feasting.

Overall, the UN report highlights the urgent need for action to address hunger and malnutrition in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly among children. Governments are urged to implement comprehensive policies that combine efforts to end poverty with nutrition, health, and education-oriented initiatives.

372,"### Context: Senator Dick Durbin claimed that President Obama's Supreme Court nominees, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, met a standard of 60 votes. However, this claim oversimplifies the process for Senate votes on Supreme Court nominees. While a formal confirmation vote does not require 60 votes, a successful cloture vote, which places a time limit on the consideration of a nominee, does require 60 votes. The confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees involves a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, referral to the full Senate, and a vote by the full Senate. If unanimous consent cannot be reached, and if at least one senator filibusters, the Senate majority leader would need to invoke cloture, which requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, there is additional debate time before a final confirmation vote. The rule change in 2013 eliminated the 60-vote threshold for most nominations, but Supreme Court nominees were excluded from this change. Some Democrats have threatened to filibuster the nomination of Neil Gorsuch, which would require 60 votes to invoke cloture. Currently, Republicans hold 52 seats in the Senate, which is enough to reach the final vote threshold of 51 votes if they can get that far. Durbin's claim that Kagan and Sotomayor met a standard of 60 votes is misleading because the nominations were never filibustered, and the final confirmation only required 51 votes. The existing Senate ""standard"" does not specify reaching 60 votes. Durbin's claim is therefore rated as misleading.

The ad uses a two-year-old quote from Paul to suggest that he wants to decriminalize non-violent crimes such as drug dealing, theft, burglary, and prostitution. The ad features law enforcement officers questioning whether criminals like Bernie Madoff should be in jail and asking about the legality of meth and drug dealers, theft, burglary, and promoting prostitution. Paul has repeatedly denounced the ad, stating that it is dishonest and a lie. He explains that the quote was taken out of context from a discussion about helmet laws and whether adults should have the right to gamble or buy lottery tickets. Paul clarifies that he is not proposing any changes to drug laws or laws against prostitution. He believes that issues of crime should be addressed at the state and local government level. The Conway campaign argues that Paul's words speak for themselves and that he believes non-violent crimes should not be against the law. However, the article points out that Paul's opinion is that crime issues should be decided by states and local governments, not that he wants to decriminalize drug dealing, theft, burglary, and prostitution. The article concludes that while Paul could have chosen his words more carefully, the ad is more of a political ""gotcha"" than a legitimate issue. It states that Paul has repeatedly and unequivocally said he does not want to make those activities legal and has no plans to change the current laws regarding them.

375,"### Context: President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is the ""biggest trade deal ever made."" However, this claim is not entirely accurate. While the USMCA is a significant trade agreement, it is not a completely new deal but rather an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which has been in place since 1994.

The USMCA introduces several changes, particularly in the auto industry and intellectual property protection. It also addresses issues related to the Canadian dairy market and implements new labor and environmental standards. However, it is important to note that the USMCA is building off of NAFTA and is not a trade agreement from scratch.

Furthermore, there are larger trade pacts across the world that surpass the USMCA in terms of the number of countries involved and economic output. For example, in 2018, the European Union signed a trade agreement with Japan, covering a quarter of the global economy and 600 million people. Additionally, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included the same three USMCA partners along with nine other Pacific Rim countries, would have represented nations with 40% of global gross domestic product. However, Trump withdrew the United States from this agreement.

The USMCA is significant for the United States alone, as total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico under NAFTA is the largest of any U.S. free trade partners. Canada and Mexico account for about 30% of U.S. goods exports and imports. However, in terms of the number of countries involved and economic output, there are other trade deals that surpass the USMCA.

In conclusion, while President Trump claims that the USMCA is the ""biggest trade deal ever made,"" this is an overreach. The USMCA is an update to NAFTA and introduces changes in various areas. While it is significant for the United States, there are larger trade pacts globally in terms of the number of countries involved and economic output.

376,"### Context: A blood test may be able to identify the risk of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy, according to a new study. The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), found that each 0.1 percent increase in HbA1c levels above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22 percent higher risk for gestational diabetes. However, the release notes that the test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy and more research is needed to prove the association identified in the study. The blood test itself is considered harmless and fairly reliable, but results can be affected by unrelated diseases and lifestyle factors, leading to false positives and negatives. The release does not provide information about the population of women studied, such as age, race, number of pregnancies, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. The cost of A1C screening for gestational diabetes is estimated to be between $12 and $65, and the glucose tolerance test given later in pregnancy has an average cost of $60 to $85. The release does not provide specific cost information for the blood test in question. The potential benefits of screening for gestational diabetes include substantial savings in healthcare costs. However, the release does not provide data about the frequency of the disorder. The release emphasizes that the test is not currently recommended for clinical screening and is far from ready for use in diagnosing gestational diabetes. The test has theoretical potential to determine early risk and the potential for lifestyle changes to modify that risk. Overall, the release is considered satisfactory, as it quantifies the results and potential benefits, acknowledges the limitations of the study, and highlights the need for further research.
Claim: Blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This release accurately describes an observational study using second-hand data from another study  which found that a relatively inexpensive blood test (HbA1c or A1C for short), commonly used to monitor diabetes, might help identify women at risk for getting gestational diabetes as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. The release does a good job of explaining that the disorder carries risks — including the development of adult type 2 diabetes long after birth — for both pregnant women and their newborns. The release notes that the study does not scientifically demonstrate that measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy can in fact determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. On the down side, the release doesn’t mention what it would cost in dollars or potential over treatment to screen every women in the early weeks of pregnancy;  offers no information about the overall prevalence and incidence of gestational diabetes or any details about the women whose records were studied; and waits until the last sentence to note that there also is no firm evidence that lowering HbA1c levels with diet and exercise before or in early pregnancy will actually reduce risk for gestational diabetes. Public health and obstetrical associations estimate that 1 to 15% of all pregnant women in the U.S. develop gestational diabetes and no doubt a greater percentage worries they might. There are potentially serious health consequences to gestational diabetes for mother and child and although some mothers at higher than usual risk — for example, women with obesity — are screened early, most women have a screening blood glucose test later in pregnancy. Glucose and insulin levels are complicated to interpret later in pregnancy. The notion that earlier detection with a test that measures average  glucose levels over time might lead to lowered rates of the disorder is seductive. But it’s also true that such a scenario is only speculation at this time. As a consequence, news releases about this topic are of fairly wide interest, but must be careful not to over promise.",Blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester,"This news release describes a study that found a correlation between a woman’s A1C level in the first trimester of pregnancy and her risk of developing gestational diabetes. The release does a good job of explaining the study and its findings, and of making clear that the test in question is not yet ready for clinical use. The release would have been stronger had it included some cost information, and it would have been stronger still had it included some data about the frequency of gestational diabetes. The release also would have been stronger had it included some information about the women who were studied, such as age, race, number of pregnancies, socioeconomic status and comorbidities. Gestational diabetes is a condition in which a woman develops high blood sugar during pregnancy that resolves after the baby is born. It is estimated to affect 18% of pregnant women in the U.S. The condition can lead to complications for both the mother and the baby. A blood test that could identify women at risk of developing gestational diabetes would be a boon to public health."

It mentions that the cost of viscosupplementation varies between $300 to $500 per injection and that the duration of its effectiveness can range from weeks to up to six months. The article questions the high quality evidence that supports the use of viscosupplementation and raises concerns about the longevity of its benefits. It also mentions that the treatment is not recommended by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. The article highlights the potential bias of the American Society for Sports Medicine, which is promoting viscosupplementation as a treatment option. It mentions that the release does not provide data to support the claim that viscosupplementation is more effective than other treatments. The article suggests that other treatments such as weight reduction, braces, and analgesics should be considered before viscosupplementation. It also notes that insurance coverage for the treatment may vary. Overall, the article questions the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viscosupplementation as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis.
Claim: Viscosupplementation Recommended For Appropriate Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) describes a therapy called viscosupplementation that involves injecting hyaluronic acid, a gel-like fluid, that acts as a lubricant to alleviate pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. In this case the target audience is senior citizens. Because the subhead of the release describes it as a “New Scientific Statement” the ASSM might be forgiven for the medical jargon used throughout the release. This clearly wasn’t written for the general public. For example, the release doesn’t explain the term “viscosupplementation,” which is what this release is promoting. We hope health journalists take care when re-interpreting the language for the older Americans considering their many options for treating a common ailment like painful knees. The release offers no discussion on costs of viscosupplementation or insurance coverage restrictions. The benefit data is limited and there are no mention of harms. The article upon which this recommendation is based won’t be published until January 2016 which makes these limitations much more critical. Osteoarthritis of the knee is the most common form of arthritis and can be seen as a normal part of aging and of “wear and tear” of the body. It occurs most often in people over age 50 and more often in women than in men. It’s degenerative, getting worse over time. With the aging of the US population, especially considering the crush of baby boomers, the subject of how best to manage the pain and disability seen with osteoarthritis of the knee becomes important. While viscosupplementation has been available for many years, the majority of randomized clinical trials have not demonstrated a consistent or important benefit to either pain level or functionality from this therapy.

However, officials say they’re still testing to see whether the recalled beef is related to the outbreak. A recall notice from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety Inspection Service says K2D Foods is recalling about 56.7 tons (51.4 metric tons) of meat. K2D does business as Colorado Premium Foods of Carrollton, Georgia. The meat is in 48-pound boxes labeled “ground beef puck” for institutional use. Calls to the company’s headquarters in Greeley, Colorado, weren’t immediately returned.
Claim: Recall: Nearly 57 tons of ground beef for possible E coli.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,The federal government says a meat company in Georgia has recalled tons of ground beef for possible contamination with E. coli bacteria.,Recall: Nearly 57 tons of ground beef for possible E coli.,The U.S. Department of Agriculture is recalling nearly 57 tons (51.4 metric tons) of ground beef because of a possible E. coli contamination.
379,"### Context: In an interview on WPRO's The John DePetro show, independent gubernatorial candidate Lincoln Chafee criticized former Red Sox ace Curt Schilling and questioned his trustworthiness. Chafee was referring to Schilling's role in a controversial state economic development deal that would give his video game company, 38 Studios, a $75-million loan guarantee if he moved it to Rhode Island. Chafee criticized the agreement for risking more than half of a new state loan guarantee program on a company that had never generated any revenue. However, Chafee's comments about Schilling's teammates not liking him and painting his bloody sock were seen as disrespectful to the Red Sox player who helped end the team's 86-year championship drought in 2004.

Chafee's campaign quickly retracted the comments, stating that they were intended as an off-hand reference to published reports about the bloody sock and that Chafee respected Schilling's achievements as a professional athlete and his support of charitable causes. The campaign emphasized that Chafee's main concern was protecting the interests of Rhode Island taxpayers.

The article then delves into the history of the rumor that Schilling's bloody sock was actually painted. The rumor originated in 2007 when Baltimore Orioles TV announcer Gary Thorne claimed that Boston's then-backup catcher Doug Mirabelli told him it was a hoax. However, Thorne later apologized, stating that Mirabelli had told him he was joking. The rumor has resurfaced from time to time but has never gained much traction.

The article concludes by stating that all indications suggest that the blood on Schilling's sock was real and that Chafee was wrong in his comments. Chafee's campaign spokesperson acknowledged the mistake and compared it to shooting themselves in the foot. The article criticizes Chafee for the error in the public relations department.

Overall, the article highlights Chafee's criticism of Schilling and the controversy surrounding the rumor that Schilling's bloody sock was painted. It concludes that Chafee was incorrect in his comments and emphasizes the significance of the bloody sock in Red Sox history.

380,"### Context: The article discusses a study published in JAMA that suggests ultrasound can be an effective additional screening tool for women with dense breast tissue. The broadcast mentioned in the claim highlights the cost issue of insurance payments not covering the full cost of performing and interpreting breast ultrasounds. Medicare reimbursement for breast ultrasound is $85, which is insufficient to cover the costs. The same cost problem applies to mammography, as hospitals lose money on every mammogram they perform.

The article mentions that the addition of ultrasound to mammography detected about 4 additional cancers per 1000 women. It also states that 49% of cancers were detected by mammogram alone, while 78% were detected by mammography plus ultrasound. However, the broadcast does not provide this important absolute data.

The potential harms of treatment, such as false positives, unnecessary biopsies, and anxiety, are mentioned in the story. False positives may decrease with additional screening methods like MRI or annual ultrasound. The high rate of false positives with mammography plus ultrasound means that only about 1 in 10 women with suspected cancer on combined screening actually had cancer when biopsy was done, compared to 1 in 5 women with abnormal mammograms alone.

The study discussed in the broadcast is one of the few large-scale randomized controlled trials evaluating ultrasound as an additional screening method for women with dense breasts. However, the story does not adequately discuss the study design or provide context and in-depth analysis.

The broadcast does not engage in disease mongering and focuses on the review of the JAMA paper. It mentions that ultrasound may find more early-stage cancers in women with dense breast tissue, who may be at higher risk and may be missed by traditional screening methods.

The story lacks independent expert perspective, as the only physician or expert interviewed only commented on how ultrasound works, not on the findings of the study. The story also mentions MRI as a supplemental screening method for women at very high risk and breast biopsy if there is a suspicion of cancer. It emphasizes the need to tailor screening to a woman's individual risk profile and preferred screening schedule.

The availability of properly trained physicians and technicians can vary in real-world clinical settings, potentially affecting the accuracy of ultrasound screening. The study provides good evidence of the value of ultrasound as an additional screening tool, but the story does not mention that ultrasound is already available and not a new method of treatment.

Overall, the article highlights the cost issue of insurance payments, the benefits and potential harms of ultrasound as an additional screening tool, the study design, the lack of independent expert perspective, and the need for tailored screening based on individual risk profiles.
Claim: Finding cancer that mammograms can miss
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The focus of this story was a review of a newly-published study demonstrating added benefit of ultrasound in addition to mammography for women at increased risk of cancer due to dense breast tissue. The story appropriately mentions why traditional screening methods may miss an early-stage tumor in this population. It is not the usual standard to do any other screening (aside from mammogram) in women with dense breast tissue situations, except for very high-risk BRCA carriers who now get MRI as well. Ultrasound is already available, as implied in the story, and not a new method of treatment. The broadcast does not mention that physicians and ultrasonographers in the study were trained using standardized screening protocols. In a real-world clinical setting, the availability of properly training physicians and technicians can vary, resulting in greater false-negatives or false-positives. The editorial by Dr. Kulk accompanying the JAMA source article states, ""It is questionable whether the diagnostic accuracy achieved in the study..would have been the same if nonradiologists had performed screening ultrasound."" The story could have mentioned this. In addition, the story didn’t discuss costs, didn’t explain why this study was ""the most definitive so far,"" and didn’t explain benefits in absolute terms which are probably most helpful to most viewers. Importantly, the story mentions that screening may need to be tailored to a woman’s individual risk profile, as well as her preferred screening schedule based on an assessment of risks and benefits.",Finding cancer that mammograms can miss,"This broadcast story reports on a recent study published in JAMA that found that the addition of ultrasound to mammography can detect more early-stage cancers in women with dense breast tissue.

381,"### Context: Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has outlined his priorities for 2020 in a recent interview. One of his main focuses is improving mental health care in the state, as he believes Ohio is currently lacking in this area. DeWine wants to ensure that those with mental health issues have access to help as early as possible.

Another important issue for DeWine is the opioid crisis. He has convened a working group to determine how any settlement dollars from lawsuits against drugmakers should be spent. DeWine believes that the money should be used to address addiction problems.

DeWine has also expressed concern about the high rate of assault against juvenile offenders in Ohio's youth prisons. He has ordered his director of youth prisons to investigate the issue and report back to him. DeWine wants to implement real-time monitoring of abuse allegations to ensure the safety of incarcerated individuals.

When it comes to politics, DeWine declined to comment on the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. However, he believes that his administration's efforts at bipartisan compromise in politically divided Ohio should inspire faith that politicians can work together.

DeWine is optimistic that a package of gun-law changes will eventually pass through the Legislature. He believes that the stalled proposal will eventually be approved, despite facing resistance from the Republican-controlled Legislature.

On the topic of abortion, DeWine did not discuss whether he would sign a bill that included a description of a medically impossible procedure for reimplanting ectopic pregnancies. He wants to focus on the legal fate of legislation that bans abortions after the first fetal heartbeat. DeWine stated that he is not taking positions on other pending abortion legislation at this time.

DeWine also highlighted his achievements in his first year as governor, including passing a gas-tax increase and a compromise state budget that allocated funding for mental health and children's programs. He also cut income taxes for low-wage earners with support from both parties.

Overall, DeWine's agenda for 2020 includes improving mental health care, addressing the opioid crisis, ensuring the safety of incarcerated individuals, promoting bipartisan cooperation, passing gun-law changes, and monitoring the legal fate of abortion legislation.

The virus has spread to 15 countries, with over 6,000 cases reported worldwide, the majority of which are in China. All deaths so far have occurred in China, with 132 fatalities reported as of Tuesday. Chinese President Xi Jinping described the situation as ""grim and complex."" The WHO's panel of experts will reassess the situation on Thursday. The organization praised China's response to the outbreak, stating that they are taking extraordinary measures. Major airlines have suspended flights to China, and there are predictions of a significant impact on economic growth. In many Chinese cities, streets are deserted, tourist attractions are closed, and Starbucks coffee shops are requiring temperature checks and mask-wearing. The virus has primarily affected the central province of Hubei, which is under virtual lockdown. The virus originated in a live wild animal market in the provincial capital Wuhan. Several governments, including the United States, France, and Britain, are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. The virus is having a significant impact on China's economy, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists canceling trips. Various airlines are reducing flights, and Hong Kong stocks have taken a hit. However, scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, which could potentially lead to the development of a vaccine. The number of cases in China has surpassed the 5,327 cases of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003. While the new strain, known as ""2019-nCoV,"" may not be as deadly as SARS, concerns have grown due to its rapid spread and unknown attributes.

383,"### Context: The article discusses a new argument being made by anti-abortion groups, claiming that every sperm cell is a life and therefore masturbation is murder. The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person with a right to live. However, this new argument takes the abortion debate to the next level. Pro-life activist Rachel Stratt argues that life begins before conception and that wasting semen through masturbation is equivalent to killing thousands of babies. She and her group of protesters are calling for strict laws against ejaculation for self-gratification in every state across the country.

The article also mentions that the image attached to the story, featuring women protesting with a sign that reads ""Ejaculation is Murder,"" is from 2014 and has been manipulated. It is important to note that the website, Straight Stoned, includes a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer suggesting that its content is not meant to be taken seriously.

In summary, the article reports on the claim made by anti-abortion groups that every sperm cell is a life and therefore masturbation is murder. It highlights the argument put forth by pro-life activist Rachel Stratt and her call for strict laws against ejaculation for self-gratification.

384,"### Context: Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus defended the 2016 Republican Party platform, which many observers have said leans to the right on social issues. In an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd, Priebus was asked about the platform’s position on same-sex marriage. He referenced a draft that claims ""the data, the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion that every child deserves a married mom and dad"" based on the belief that children raised in a traditional household are healthier and less likely to engage in crime and substance abuse. Priebus stated that while it is possible for children of same-sex parents and single parents to have successful lives, the best scenario is for children to grow up in a traditional opposite-sex household.

However, scholarly research shows that the claim made by Priebus is not supported by the evidence. Researchers at Columbia Law School reviewed 78 scholarly articles on the well-being of children living with gay or lesbian parents over the past three decades. Of those articles, 74 concluded that children of same-sex parents fare no worse than children of opposite-sex parents. The remaining four articles that argue children face more risks with opposite-sex parents than they do with same-sex parents are considered problematic because most of the child subjects grew up with opposite-sex parents but one of the parents eventually came out as gay or lesbian, causing family breakup or turmoil.

Gary Gates, an expert in LGBT demography at the University of California Los Angeles, states that studies comparing children in long-term intact families with same-sex couple parents show that they generally do as well as kids in long-term intact families with different-sex parents. Gates co-authored an overview of contemporary research about LGBT parents, which found that LGBT parents and their children are doing well. However, research in this area faces challenges such as obtaining a large and diverse sample size and studying subcategories like sibling dynamics among children with same-sex parent families or domestic violence.

Overall, the scholarly consensus is that what matters to children is the quality and stability of the parenting, rather than the parents’ particular sex, gender, or sexual orientation. The claim made by Priebus that ""the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad"" is not supported by scholarly data.

385,"### Context: Kansas Governor Laura Kelly discussed the ongoing problems at Osawatomie State Hospital, stating that the 60-bed Adair Acute Care unit is too small to accommodate patients with serious mental health issues. The facility has faced issues since January 2016 when it was decertified by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services due to security and safety concerns. This led to the loss of millions of dollars in federal funds. In December 2017, the Adair portion of the facility was re-certified, allowing it to receive Medicare funding for the 60 beds. However, federal inspectors found that treatment for some patients needed to be more frequent and intense, and there were missing treatment notes and plans without specific goals.

The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, which oversees state hospitals, is working on improvement plans to address these issues. The department has filed a plan to provide more individualized treatment for patients and is also considering crisis centers as a way to improve the state's mental health care system. A law signed in 2017 allows these centers to involuntarily admit individuals for up to 72 hours, and last year, lawmakers approved $2.6 million for mental health care improvements, including funding for the centers.

Governor Kelly believes that investing in crisis centers makes more sense than adding capacity to state mental health hospitals. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services plans to lift the moratorium on new admissions to Osawatomie, which has been in place for years. The agency also aims to focus on providing care near patients' homes and communities.

More detailed information about the plans and budget proposals will be released when Governor Kelly presents her proposed budget later this month. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services spokesperson, Cara Sloan-Ramos, confirmed that the agency will include a plan to lift the moratorium on new admissions to Osawatomie and continue focusing on providing care in patients' local areas.

386,"### Context: The claim that former President Barack Obama was arrested in Japan in connection with a large quantity of cocaine found on his yacht is false. The rumor originated from a blog post by Benjamin Fulford, who had previously claimed that the Japanese government was trying to kill him. The post was further aggregated by dubious websites. The blog post claimed that Obama was in custody of the US military police and had informed on his drug dealing bosses. It also mentioned the impoundment of an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines at Argyle International Airport in the Caribbean, which was intended to finance the operations of Daesh (ISIS). The post also referenced a conspiracy site's report about Obama fleeing the scene of a drug bust on a fishing vessel named the Lady Michelle in the Caribbean.

However, none of these claims are true. The story originated from a fake news conspiracy site called WhatDoesItMean.com, known for publishing sensational and false reports. The site's alleged author, Sorcha Faal, is known for creating reports with sensational headlines and quotes from supposed high-level Russian sources. The image used in the article was taken from a news report about a U.S. Coast Guard drug bust off the coast of Suriname, which had no connection to Obama or Japan.

In summary, the claim that Obama was arrested in Japan in connection with a cocaine seizure on his yacht is false. The rumor originated from a fake news conspiracy site and has no basis in reality.

387,"### Context: Costs were reported. Much more clearly than the competing WSJ story, Reuters reported: “”Testing might lead to more harm than good.” Unlike the competing Wall Street Journal story, this story was clear about the potential harms: “it’s well known that the scans expose patients to a high dose of X-rays, which can increase their likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the images cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.” Clear, succinct summary of the evidence. No disease mongering. An author of the paper, and the author of an accompanying editorial were quoted. The story ends with the researcher saying “doctors should focus on patients’ lifestyle and traditional risk factors such as smoking and obesity.” The story was clear that the scans are not currently recommended by guidelines but that “there have been several reports of doctors doing CCTA heart scans in healthy patients, although the practice is currently discouraged by the American Heart Association.” The relative novelty of the screening test could be deduced from the story. It’s clear that the story did not rely on a news release.
Claim: Heart scans tied to “evidence-free” treatment: study
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story summarized the study and its significance clearly in the first sentence – “When symptom-free people have heart scans to look for clogged arteries, they can end up with overtreatment and side effects.”  The story delivered powerful quotes from experts to put the findings into context for readers:  “Testing might lead to more harm than good.”   “With these new imaging techniques, we are left with the dilemma of what to do with the results.”   “Overdiagnosis is threatening to become an increasingly important public health problem because of the enthusiasm for and proliferation of uNPRoven screening tests.”",Heart scans tied to “evidence-free” treatment: study,"This was a well-written, clear summary of the evidence. It was a bit longer than the competing Wall Street Journal story, and it was more clear about the potential harms of the scans. It also was more clear about the costs of the scans. The competing Wall Street Journal story was a bit stronger in its discussion of the quality of the evidence."
388,"### Context: A study conducted in Sweden found that higher levels of folic acid in teenagers' blood were associated with better school grades. The study included 386 teenagers between the ages of 15 and 16, and their folic acid levels were measured through blood samples. The researchers divided the participants into three groups based on their folic acid levels: low, medium, and high.

The study found that the teenagers in the high folic acid group had significantly higher grades compared to those in the low folic acid group. On average, the high folic acid group had a grade point average (GPA) that was 0.4 higher than the low folic acid group. The researchers also took into account other factors that could affect academic performance, such as socioeconomic status and parents' education level.

The study did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between folic acid levels and grades, but it suggests that folic acid may play a role in cognitive function. Folic acid is known to be important for brain development and function, and previous research has shown that folic acid deficiency during pregnancy can lead to cognitive impairments in children.

It is worth noting that the study had some limitations. It was a small study conducted in Sweden, where the food supply is not fortified with folic acid like it is in the United States. The study also did not account for other potential differences between the groups of teenagers with high and low folic acid levels.

Experts not involved in the study commented on the findings, highlighting the importance of a balanced diet and adequate nutrient intake for overall health and cognitive function. They also emphasized the need for further research to better understand the relationship between folic acid and academic performance.

In conclusion, this study suggests that higher levels of folic acid in teenagers' blood may be associated with better school grades. However, more research is needed to establish a causal relationship and to understand the potential mechanisms behind this association.
Claim: Folic acid tied to better grades in Swedish teens
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,This is a story about a recent study published in the journal Pediatrics which found an association between folic acid levels and school grades in a cohort of Swedish teens. This story did a reasonable job of describing this cohort study. It explained that the small study may not be meaningful in the US where many common foods are fortified with folic acid – making it unlikely that there are children with low or marginal intakes of this B vitamin. Understanding how to interpret study results and knowing the appropriate questions to ask in order to understand how those results might be applicable is a valuable skill. Helping people think about studies of nutrition in context and whether they might apply to other populations is important. This story demonstrated those skills.,Folic acid tied to better grades in Swedish teens,"This story reports on a small study that found a correlation between folic acid levels and academic performance in Swedish teens. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s limitations and of pointing out that the study did not prove that folic acid supplementation would improve academic performance. However, the story should have been more clear about the fact that the study was conducted in a country where the food supply is not fortified with folic acid, as it is in the U.S. This is an important detail that could have helped readers understand the study’s limitations. The story also should have been more clear about the fact that the study did not prove that folic acid supplementation would improve academic performance."

390,"### Context: The article discusses a viral social media post that circulated in January 2020, claiming to be an ""emergency notification"" from an unspecified ""Ministry of Health"" about the ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus. The warning appeared in two forms: a text post and a photograph of a printed email. Both versions emphasized the importance of keeping the throat moist to prevent the virus from invading the body.

The text post included recommendations such as drinking warm water, avoiding crowded places, wearing masks, and loading up on vitamin C. It also listed symptoms of the illness, including repeated high fever, prolonged coughing after fever, and respiratory-related issues. The message urged readers to share the information to help others and concluded with a plea to care for human life.

The photograph of the printed email had similar content, stating that the upper respiratory infection affecting China was serious and caused by a potent virus resistant to antibiotics. It reiterated the importance of keeping the throat moist and provided guidelines for drinking warm water based on age. The email also advised avoiding crowded places, wearing masks, and consuming vitamin C. It listed the same symptoms and emphasized the contagious nature of the illness.

According to the article, the viral social media post was authentic and accurate, representing a legitimate ""health bulletin"" about the new coronavirus outbreak from an official public health authority. However, the specific source of the alert and the Ministry of Health mentioned in the message were not identified.

In summary, the article confirms that the viral social media post in January 2020 was a genuine health bulletin about the new coronavirus outbreak.

391,"### Context: A small study has shown that a drug called MLE4901 can reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes in menopausal women. The study involved 37 women who experienced at least seven hot flashes per day. The women were given either MLE4901 or a placebo pill for four weeks, and then the groups swapped treatments. The results showed that women who took MLE4901 had a 72% reduction in the frequency of hot flashes and a 38% reduction in severity. The improvements started as early as three days after starting the drug and continued for the whole month of treatment. The study also found that sleep and concentration improved after three days of taking the drug. The researchers noted that these improvements could be related to the reduction in hot flashes. However, the article does not provide information on the cost of the therapy or how it compares to hormone replacement therapy, which is the current standard treatment. It also does not mention the scale used to rate the severity of hot flashes or the changes observed in the placebo group. The article mentions that a previous study on MLE4901 was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants, but it does not provide information on the adverse effects observed in this particular study. The article states that larger studies on MLE4901 are underway in the US and UK to determine its safety and effectiveness. However, it is important to note that the specific compound tested in this trial will not be taken further in trials due to side effects that may affect liver function. Two similar drugs that do not carry these side effects are being tested in larger patient trials. The article also mentions that hormone replacement therapy is still the standard therapy for menopausal symptoms and does not compare the effectiveness of MLE4901 to hormone replacement therapy. The story is based entirely on a news release and does not include independent sources.
Claim: Menopause 'hot flash' medicine could cut symptom by three quarters, trial shows
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story covers an analysis of a small study about a potential drug to treat hot flashes associated with menopause, called MLE4901. The story contains no independent sources and doesn’t stretch beyond what’s in a news release. What’s more, it omits the fact that the compound studied here won’t be used in future trials because of its potential to harm the liver. More than half of midlife women experience frequent hot flashes that can last several years, disrupting sleep and eroding their quality of life, according to one federally-funded study. While estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment option, it often isn’t prescribed for long periods and may present cardiovascular and breast cancer risks. Better treatment options would be welcome, but news stories shouldn’t stir up excitement about therapies that haven’t been proven both safe and effective.","Menopause 'hot flash' medicine could cut symptom by three quarters, trial shows","This story reports on a small, short-term study of a drug that may reduce hot flashes in menopausal women. The story does a good job of describing the study and its limitations. However, it fails to provide readers with important information, such as the cost of the drug, the scale used to rate the severity of hot flashes, and the adverse effects observed in the study. It also fails to mention that the drug is not yet available. The story also does not compare the drug to the current standard treatment, hormone replacement therapy.

392,"### Context: The article debunks a meme that claims U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz has had seven DUIs and was involved in the suspicious death of his college roommate. The article confirms that Gaetz's mug shot from a 2008 DUI arrest is real, as acknowledged by Gaetz himself and reported by the Tampa Bay Times in 2014. The arrest occurred when Gaetz was 26 years old and driving back from a nightclub. He was caught speeding, had watery and bloodshot eyes, and admitted to consuming two beers. Gaetz refused a breathalyzer test and was arrested, but charges were later dropped and his license was reinstated, raising questions about potential political influence. However, public records show that the 2008 arrest is Gaetz's only recorded DUI.

The article also addresses the claim of Gaetz's involvement in the suspicious death of his college roommate. The claim originated from conspiracy theorist Wayne Madsen, who provided no evidence or sources to support his claim. The article states that there is no online evidence or press coverage of a suspicious death of a Florida State University student who could have been Gaetz's roommate between 1999 and 2003. The claim is considered without merit.

The article concludes that while Gaetz's mug shot and 2008 DUI arrest are true, the additional claims made in the meme are sourced solely from the imagination of a conspiracy theorist. The meme's claim of seven DUIs and involvement in a suspicious death are debunked as baseless and lacking evidence.

393,"### Context: The article discusses an ad by the Sharron Angle campaign that portrays Harry Reid, Reid's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, as a friend to illegal immigrants. The ad claims that Reid voted against declaring English as the national language of the United States, twice. The article fact-checks this claim and provides evidence to support it.

In 2006, during a push for comprehensive immigration reform, Senator James Inhofe proposed an amendment to declare English as the national language of the United States. The amendment aimed to require all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English and establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Reid made an impassioned speech denouncing the bill as ""racist"" and ""divisive"" and voted against it. The amendment passed with the help of 11 Democrats.

In the same year, another amendment proposed by Senator Ken Salazar to declare English as the common and unifying language of the United States was passed, and Reid voted in favor of it. However, the immigration reform bill did not pass that year.

In 2007, during another attempt at comprehensive immigration reform, Inhofe proposed another amendment to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States. Reid voted against it, and the amendment passed.

The article concludes that Reid twice voted against amendments to declare English as the national language of the United States, even though he voted for an amendment to declare English as the common and unifying language of the United States. The claim made in the ad that Reid voted against declaring English as the national language is supported by his voting record and his vocal opposition to the bills. Therefore, the claim is rated as true.

Overall, the article provides evidence to support the claim that Harry Reid voted against declaring English as the national language of the United States, twice.

394,"### Context: A study published in the journal Science Advances has found that two species from South Africa, Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus, had better hearing than both chimpanzees and humans in a frequency range that may have facilitated vocal communication in a savanna habitat. These species had a mixture of ape-like and human-like anatomical traits and lived in grassland ecosystems with widely spaced trees and shrubs. The researchers discovered that both species had maximum hearing sensitivity shifted towards slightly higher frequencies compared to chimpanzees, and they had better hearing than chimps or humans in the range from about 1.0-3.0 kilohertz. This range includes sounds such as vowels and some consonants, which are important for communication.

According to paleoanthropologist Rolf Quam, this auditory pattern may have been particularly favorable for living on the savanna, where sound waves do not travel as far as in the rainforest canopy. Short-range communication is favored in open environments like the savanna. The human lineage split from chimpanzees around 5 to 7 million years ago, and our ancestors' hearing abilities began to adapt to lifestyle changes.

To assess the hearing abilities of the two species, the researchers studied fossils, including tiny middle-ear bones called the ossicles, and created virtual computer reconstructions of the ear's internal anatomy. The researchers found that our species, Homo sapiens, which emerged about 200,000 years ago, has better hearing across a wider range of frequencies, generally from 1.0 to 6.0 kilohertz. This range encompasses many sounds emitted during spoken language.

The study does not argue that these early humans had language with symbolic content, but rather that they could communicate vocally, as all primates do. However, human language emerged at some point after the existence of these early humans.

Paleontologist Juan Luis Arsuaga suggests that the hearing abilities of these early humans indicate that their voices would have sounded strange, being half chimp-like and half human, to us. In other words, their voices were not completely human.

Overall, this study provides insights into the hearing abilities of early human ancestors and how their auditory patterns may have been favorable for communication in a savanna habitat.

395,"### Context: Southeast Asian nations, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand, are among the worst ocean polluters in the world. These countries are responsible for throwing the most plastic waste into the oceans, along with China. The region's coasts have seen an increase in marine debris, with whales and sea turtles washing up dead with large amounts of plastic rubbish in their stomachs.

To address this issue, a summit for leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is being hosted by Thailand. The summit is expected to adopt the Bangkok Declaration on Combating Marine Debris in the ASEAN Region. Thailand, as the current chair of the group, has praised the declaration as a significant step for the region. However, there are concerns about the implementation of the declaration, as ASEAN has a code of non-interference that leaves policymaking in the hands of individual member countries.

Environmentalists have welcomed ASEAN's move to adopt the joint declaration but emphasize the need for urgent action. They suggest that all ASEAN countries should ban single-use plastic as a first step for the declaration to be effective. Globally, up to 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used each year, with 8 million tonnes of plastic waste ending up in the oceans annually. This plastic waste kills marine life and enters the human food chain.

Thailand, in particular, generates about 2 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, with only about 25% being recycled. The rest goes to incineration or landfill, with around 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes leaking into the ocean. Some major retailers in Thailand have taken initiatives to reduce plastic bags, but environmentalists argue that stricter policy initiatives are needed to encourage more businesses to take action.

In addition to banning single-use plastic, ASEAN should aim to improve waste management schemes and hold producers of consumer goods accountable. There should be designated places for every item to go, and producers should be responsible for taking back the single-use plastic they produce. These measures would help prevent plastic waste from leaking into the ocean.

Overall, individual efforts alone cannot fully stop the plastic pollution in the oceans. Governments in Southeast Asia must take urgent action to address the issue, and the ASEAN declaration is seen as a positive step. However, implementation and stricter policies are needed to effectively combat marine debris in the region.

The letter appeared on a Facebook fan page for the actor, but it is not his official page. The fan page clearly states that it is not associated with Keanu Reeves and that it spreads positivity by quoting what they read. The letter discusses Reeves' early life, living with dyslexia, and the loss of loved ones, including a stillborn daughter and the death of his girlfriend in a car accident. However, Keanu Reeves has refused to talk about his personal life, making it unlikely that he would write such a letter. In a 2008 profile, Reeves remained stoic and declined to discuss his personal life, including the loss of his daughter and girlfriend. The letter's actual author is unknown. Similar celebrity pranks have occurred in the past, such as false reports of Richard Gere giving food and money to every homeless person in New York and Jennifer Aniston donating to a homeless single mother. These hoaxes may be designed to draw a response from celebrities or make them look bad when debunking rumors about their kindness.

397,"### Context: The article discusses a study that examines the benefits of fish oil after a heart attack. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline provided both the fish oil and placebo pills. The cost of the intervention is not disclosed, but it is mentioned that the fish oil used in the study is not a standard over-the-counter product. The article highlights that the study found a 6% reduction in scarring, but it does not provide context on what this means in terms of reducing repeat heart attacks or other cardiac events. The article also fails to mention any potential harms of fish oil, such as its interaction with blood thinners like aspirin. The study design, sample size, and type of design are accurately described, but there is a lack of discussion around study limitations. The article acknowledges that the study measured surrogate markers rather than direct events like repeat heart attacks. It also mentions that a substantial proportion of patients could not return for follow-up visits and that no specific recommendations were given regarding dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake. The article does not engage in disease-mongering and only interviews the lead investigator, Dr. Raymond Kwong. It does not discuss any alternatives to fish oil. The article recognizes the novelty of the study in examining the benefits of fish oil in a patient population immediately after a heart attack. However, it does not provide further discussion on the use of MRI to assess heart conditions, which would have highlighted the novelty of the study. Overall, the article provides a satisfactory summary of the study, but it could have included more context, discussion of limitations, and information on potential harms.
Claim: Fish Oil Has Benefits After a Heart Attack: Study
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"In a randomized controlled trial studying fish oil versus placebo, a very modest improvement in heart health markers was observed in people prescribed fish oil. This TIME article demonstrates a good understanding of the study’s novelty, which appears to be among the first to look at potential benefits of fish oil in patients who have just had a heart attack. However, the story missed the mark in several ways: It didn’t mention the potential harms of taking fish oil if you’re a post-heart attack patient, nor did it discuss costs of the intervention. The only person quoted is the lead researcher of the study–an independent source was needed. Lastly, several limitations of the study are not discussed, including that many patients did not return for post-treatment follow-up. Fish oil is a widely used health supplement. Notwithstanding dozens of rigorous studies that cast doubt on its actual health benefits, the popularity of fish oil supplements remains unabated. Most studies have looked at the preventive benefits of fish oil in high-risk populations. The study reported here, on the other hand, examines the protective benefits of fish oil in patients right after a heart attack. The results suggest that high doses of fish oil after a heart attack may have modest benefits, based on measurements of things like scarring and heart function, which are surrogate markers. News coverage ideally points out this fact–that these markers can’t tell us if fish oil actually reduces the risk of a repeat heart attack, death or other cardiac event.",Fish Oil Has Benefits After a Heart Attack: Study,"This is a story about a study that used MRI to assess the scarring of the heart muscle after a heart attack. The study found that patients who took fish oil pills had less scarring than those who took placebo pills. The story does a good job of describing the study design and sample size. It also does a good job of describing the novelty of using MRI to assess heart conditions. However, the story does not provide any context for the benefits found in the study. A 6% reduction in scarring is not very meaningful. The story also does not provide any discussion of the study limitations.

398,"### Context: The article discusses the costs and effectiveness of nicotine replacement products in helping smokers quit. It mentions that sales of these products have increased over the years, with sales totaling over $800 million annually since 1997. However, the article criticizes the lack of information on the costs of individual products compared to cigarettes.

The article also mentions that the cost of an 8-week nicotine patch treatment is approximately $160-200. It notes that none of the stories, including this one, provide hard numbers for quantifying the benefits of these products.

The article highlights that the study mentioned in the story did not provide information on whether two-thirds of the study participants relapsed or if the same one-third relapsed at different intervals. It questions the comprehensiveness of the study and its ability to accurately measure the effectiveness of the products.

The potential harms of taking nicotine and the additional risks of continuing to smoke instead of using a more successful smoking cessation program are not mentioned in the article or the other stories. The article emphasizes the importance of stopping smoking quickly and effectively due to its status as the leading risk factor for early death.

The study design is explained in the article, with a key fact mentioned that most participants did not use the nicotine replacement products. Only 33% of participants used the products for more than six weeks. The article raises concerns about the study's ability to judge the effectiveness of the products given the varying lengths of time people took the drugs.

The article mentions that half of the people quoted in the story either work for Glaxo or receive funding from Glaxo, which may raise questions about bias. However, it acknowledges that the story includes one independent source with a good perspective on the study's strengths and drawbacks.

The article praises the specificity of the story in mentioning the types of nicotine products studied and the duration of their use. It also notes that the story did not rely on any press release.

Overall, the article discusses the limitations and criticisms of the study on nicotine replacement treatments and highlights the need for more comprehensive information on costs, benefits, and potential harms.

### Explanation:
",true,"This story managed to address nearly all of our criteria in this clearly written piece. We always wish stories had a little more detail about costs, and this one, like the other two reviewed, also missed information about harms. The main drawback to this story, though, was that it relied too heavily on people connected to GlaxoSmithKline, which makes some of the most popular nicotine replacement products. As this story points out, the research on nicotine therapy has been evolving. Because of the strength of so many clinical trials, people assume that patches, gum and other nicotine products work, but this study indicates that under real world conditions, these medicines might actually not show much benefit. The story says, “In the past five years, the declines in adult smoking seen in previous years have stalled”. Jump starting those efforts is crucial giving the impact smoking has on population health. A Cochrane Report  in 2008 reported on trials involving more than 40,000 subjects and concluded that nicotine replacement therapy improves the likelihood of smoking cessation in the short term. Although many people stop smoking, the return to smoking within a year is common. This study looks at the long term benefits over a 5 year period in the real world. Although there are limitations to the study, the conclusions bring the relative value of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent annually into question.",Nicotine Replacement Treatments May Not Work Long-Term,"This is a story about a study that found that nicotine replacement products, such as nicotine gum, patches, inhalers and nasal sprays, are not as effective as previously thought.

399,"### Context: University of Chicago Medicine doctors have successfully completed triple organ transplants on two patients, Sarah McPharlin and Daru Smith, within 30 hours of each other. McPharlin had two previous transplants canceled earlier in the year, causing a delay in her surgery. The hospital has performed the most heart-liver-kidney transplants in the world. Smith became the 16th person in the US to undergo a heart-liver-kidney transplant, and McPharlin became the 17th. Each surgery required a 22-person team, with some staff members working on both patients. The hospital also performed five other organ transplants during that time period.

Smith and McPharlin arrived at the Chicago hospital in November, but they were unaware that they were both seeking a triple transplant when they first met during pre-therapy sessions. However, McPharlin's mother discovered that Smith was awaiting the same organs as her daughter. Smith and McPharlin have been supporting each other throughout the recovery process, sharing walks and giving each other high-fives in the hallways. Nurses have noticed a difference in their recovery compared to other transplant patients because they have gone through the same surgery together.

Both patients are looking forward to their future progress and are planning a dinner together in the city once they are released and feeling better. McPharlin expressed her excitement about seeing Smith's progress and knowing that she will soon be able to do the same. The article highlights the unique bond that has formed between the two patients as they navigate their recovery together.

400,"### Context: Blood collection centers in China are experiencing a sharp drop in donations due to the coronavirus outbreak. Some centers have even issued a ""red alert"" as blood stocks dwindle. The shortage of blood supply is posing a significant challenge for clinical use, especially for cancer patients, individuals with blood diseases, and critical care patients who still require transfusions. This shortage highlights the existing problems in China's healthcare sector, as blood supplies have historically been tight.

The decrease in blood donations can be attributed to quarantine measures that limit large gatherings, making it difficult for donation centers to match regular levels of giving. Students, military members, employees at state-owned companies, and walk-in contributions have all decreased significantly. For example, the city of Nanjing requires daily donations from 300 people to meet demand, but recently only about 10 people a day have donated blood.

To address the shortage, some blood centers are collecting plasma from recovered coronavirus patients for use in treating the disease. Additionally, some centers are promoting donations as a way to support the fight against the epidemic. Bloodline, a Shanghai-based donation group, has launched a drive to help address the shortage.

The decrease in blood donations is expected to have a more significant impact once the epidemic is controlled and postponed surgeries resume. The demand for blood is likely to increase at that time. However, blood centers in Shanghai, Jiangxi, and Jining declined to comment on the situation when reached by phone.

Overall, the article highlights the critical shortage of blood donations in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. The decrease in donations is exacerbating existing problems in the healthcare sector, and efforts are being made to address the shortage through plasma collection and donation drives.

401,"### Context: Back in March 2013, a Twitter user posted an image of Magic Johnson (who is HIV positive) having blood drawn alongside the worrisome claim that Johnson was “donating blood for charity,” a rumor which later evolved to indicate the blood was to be used for leukemia and lymphoma patients:   At the time the initial tweet began to circulate, the image was traced back to its original source, which proved to be a documentary titled Endgame: AIDS in Black America. The rumor died down until a fake news site rediscovered the picture and false attribution and ran with them, adding the embellishment about leukemia and lymphoma patients. That article stated:  Retired NBA star, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, has decided to run a blood drive in conjunction with American Red Cross to support the National Awareness Month for Leukemia and Lymphoma. So far, Johnson has had a of 1,827 donors including himself and has saved about 438 patients so far. Many people are finding it odd and a bit terrifying that Johnson is donating his blood as well since he has been diagnosed as HIV+ since November of 1991. Since then, it has been reported that Magic’s HIV cell count remains so low that it is considered dormant. Although considered dormant, the virus still lives within Johnson.

402,"### Context: The article examines the claim made by Rep. Barry Loudermilk that the House Republican health care bill would expand women's access to health services by redirecting Planned Parenthood dollars to community health centers. The article finds that while there are more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics, redirecting funds to these centers may not actually expand women's access to health services.

The GOP health care bill would block Planned Parenthood from receiving reimbursements from Medicaid for any services, not just abortions. Planned Parenthood argues that this could lead to clinic closures and leave women without access to vital services. The bill would redirect funding to community health centers, but it is unclear if this would actually expand access to care. Planned Parenthood received about $553.7 million from the government in 2015, and the bill would result in a reduction of $178 million in federal outlays. However, the increase in federal funding to community health centers in the bill, $422 million, would represent a larger federal investment than the money being held back from Planned Parenthood.

The article highlights several issues that challenge the notion that redirecting funds to community health centers would expand access to care. First, there is no guarantee that the funds would go towards the same patients and services that would be lost due to the Planned Parenthood cuts. Second, community health centers are already operating with a shortage of staff, making rapid expansion difficult. Third, community health centers and Planned Parenthood clinics are not interchangeable. Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely to offer a broad range of contraceptive methods and have staff with the requisite expertise. Finally, the higher cost of providing care at community health centers raises questions about whether the increased federal funding would be sufficient to replace the lost Planned Parenthood services.

In conclusion, while there are more community health centers than Planned Parenthood clinics, redirecting funds to these centers may not actually expand women's access to health services. Challenges of geography, capacity, specialization, and cost raise significant questions about whether existing centers would be able to maintain the current patient load, much less expand it.

Scripps Health is planning to have ""COVID cabanas"" at two of its clinics, while Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has already started seeing patients in tents set up in its parking garage. The American Hospital Association has advised its members to prepare for 96 million cases of the virus in the next few months, with 4.8 million additional admissions, 1.9 million ICU admissions, and 480,000 excess deaths. Experts estimate that about 80% of people infected with the virus will have mild symptoms and can remain at home, while the remaining 20% are likely to develop serious symptoms and require hospitalization. The elderly and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk. Currently, there are 95,000 ICU beds in the United States, but there may be a shortage of 75,000 to 100,000 ICU beds if there is a full-blown outbreak. Hospitals are making contingency plans to care for patients in anesthesia recovery units or other areas within the hospital.

404,"### Context: A 12-year study by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has found that bug-borne diseases in the United States have more than tripled from 2004 to 2016, with nine new diseases being introduced during that time period. Missouri ranks around the average for mosquito-borne diseases but is in the top 40 percent for cases of disease caused by tick bites. Health professionals in Missouri have noticed an increase in patients seeking treatment for bug-borne diseases. Most cases are seen in clinics rather than hospitals. Increased awareness is believed to be a factor in more patients seeking treatment. Tick bites are the most common cases seen by health professionals. It is important to remove ticks immediately and monitor bites closely for any symptoms. Ticks can cause illness even if they have been on the body for a short time. Health professionals recommend using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves in areas where bugs live to prevent bites. Some of these diseases can make people very sick, so it is important not to ignore symptoms such as fever and muscle aches.

405,"### Context: The claim that motorcycle owners in New Hampshire were required to install a device that limits their motorcycle to 75 mph is false. There was never any such rule proposed or mandated by the federal Department of Transportation. The article that spread this false information was published by a fake news website called Associated Media Coverage, which has since rebranded itself as The Seattle Tribune. The website did not identify itself as fake news, leading many readers to believe the false claim. The article also made other false assertions, such as the number of annual motorcycle fatalities and the percentage of fatalities caused by speeding. The cost of the speed governors mentioned in the article was also exaggerated. While speed limiters are a real thing, they typically cost a few hundred dollars, not the subsidized cost of $35 as stated in the article. The article reached nearly 10,000 people and received 5,500 likes before it was removed. The fake news website's goal was to drive clicks to their website by spreading sensational and false claims. The claim was debunked by the hoax-debunking website Snopes. In reality, the only consequence of going over 75 mph on a motorcycle is a speeding ticket.

The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The website Associated Media Coverage claimed the federal Department of Transportation was forcing motorcycle owners to install speed governors on their motorcycles that would limit their max speeds to 75 mph. That assertion was never true and was sourced to a made-up federal government official. Supporting statistics that the phony spokesman cited also exaggerated the number of motorcycle fatalities each year and the propensity for speeding among people killed in those crashes. The website did not identify itself as a purveyor of fake news, and some motorcyclists took the bait.",New regulation requires motorcycle owners to install 75 MPH governor by January 2017,What's true: Motorcycle owners in New Hampshire are required to install a device that limits their motorcycle to 75 mph.

406,"### Context: The article discusses the decision by the U.S. House of Representatives to protect pizza's status as a vegetable in school lunches. This decision comes as a result of a 2010 child nutrition law that aimed to improve the nutritional quality of lunches served to U.S. school children. The changes that were proposed would have stripped pizza's status as a vegetable and limited the frequency of serving French fries. However, the frozen food and restaurant industries, including companies like ConAgra Foods, Schwan Food Co, McCain Foods Ltd, and J.R. Simplot Co, successfully lobbied against these changes.

The American Frozen Food Institute (AFFI), a trade association representing frozen pizza and French fry makers, played a significant role in lobbying Congress on behalf of these companies. They argued that the proposed standards would make their products unpalatable to students. Other members of AFFI include H.J. Heinz Co, General Mills Inc, and Kraft Foods Inc.

The article also mentions a provision in the bill that would have limited servings of white potatoes to one cup per week in school meals. This provision was criticized by Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, who argued that the government should not subsidize unhealthy diets through school meals.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had proposed limits on starchy vegetables like corn, green peas, and lima beans, while requiring a wider variety of fruits and vegetables in school lunches. However, the bill bars the USDA from changing the way it credits tomato paste, which is used in pizza. The current rules only require two tablespoons of tomato paste for pizza to qualify as a vegetable serving.

Despite the decision to protect pizza's status as a vegetable, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack assured that U.S. school children would still see improvements in the nutritional quality of their meals. Healthier school lunches are a part of First Lady Michelle Obama's campaign to end childhood obesity.

Critics, such as Margo Wootan from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, argue that the decision to protect pizza and French fries in schools is not good for children's health but benefits the companies that produce these foods. Wootan also highlights the contradiction of food makers promoting healthy products while lobbying against regulations that aim to improve the nutritional quality of their products.

407,"### Context: The article discusses new treatments for migraines that are currently in clinical trials. The cost of these treatments is estimated to be anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. The article mentions that one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with minimal side effects. However, it is unclear if everyone in the trials is experiencing relief for three months from one injection. Patients in the trials have reported limited side effects, such as pain at the injection site, but there is a lack of long-term safety data and potential effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular function, fertility, and placental function.

The article highlights the need for more information on the evidence backing these new treatments. It questions the type of trials conducted, the number of patients involved, and the severity and frequency of their headaches. It also raises the issue of how the treatments compare to placebos. The article suggests that if the drug companies are not making this information public, it should be made clear.

The story reports that about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. have reported having a migraine in the last three months, and as many as 2 percent of Americans have at least 15 migraine days every month. The toll of migraines on health, morale, and productivity is described as substantial.

The article mentions that some medications prescribed for depression, high blood pressure, and epilepsy have been found to provide migraine relief. However, no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can be intolerable. The writer of the article describes her own quest for relief, trying multiple preventive prescription medications, supplements, injections, and participating in clinical trials, but none of them helped significantly.

The article states that the new migraine treatments are not yet available. Two manufacturers, Amgen and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and are awaiting FDA approval. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year. The high cost of these treatments may require insurance companies to require patients to have tried other options first.

Overall, the article provides information on the potential benefits and limitations of the new migraine treatments, the need for more data on their effectiveness, and the current status of their availability.
Claim: Gone With A Shot? Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This highly readable first-person story by a writer who suffers from migraine headaches describes new antibody treatments that are under FDA review. The story effectively conveys the risks of trying monoclonal antibodies, describes how they work, and explains hurdles to getting them. Especially effective is a description of the litany of treatment approaches the writer has tried over the years, to little avail, and her quest to participate in clinical trials in pursuit of the “tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life.” The story is also open about costs and potential harms from the therapies. However, the story could have used more discussion of the evidence for these new therapies–what kind of trials have been conducted, and what are their limitations? What did the trials measure, exactly? Also, the optimistic tone of the headline and lead — which describes their “potential to turn migraine treatment on its head” — doesn’t hint at the cautions further down in the story. There is clearly a big need for effective new treatments for migraine. This story paints a clear picture of the history of past attempts, accidental discoveries, the range of symptoms that migraines present in different people, and the possibilities, costs, and potential long-term side effects of drugs now being tested.",Gone With A Shot?

408,"### Context: The story includes the cost of pomegranate pills. The story included critical analysis of claims of benefit, including the overview quote:  “There’s no definitive clinical trial demonstrating a beneficial effect of pomegranate fruit, juice or pills in people.” There are potential harms of the supplement including drug interactions with several common medications including antidepressants as listed in Medlineplus. A description of these potential harms can be found at:  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/392.html#Safety So there are not only questions about benefits, there are very real harms to consider as well. Excellent point-by-point evaluation of the evidence for claims made about purported benefits for the heart and for the prostate. No disease-mongering here. Good sourcing with independent experts and identification of company funding for one researcher. The ending quote delivers an appropriate contextual wrapup:  “If they’re part of an overall healthy diet, I don’t object,” (Dr. John Gordon Harold, cardiologist says), but I’m not sure the ends justify the means.” The story could have reminded readers that there is evidence for how to reduce risk of heart disease, such as smoking cessation and exercise. Also, there are a variety of therapies for erectile dysfunction. The availability of pomegranate-containing fruit and pills is clear in the story. Not applicable. No claims of novelty were made.

409,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson that there has never been a death caused by a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States, even during the Three Mile Island accident in the 1970s. The article examines the validity of this claim by looking at the immediate and long-term effects of the Three Mile Island accident.

Experts and historians agree that no one died during the immediate crisis surrounding the Three Mile Island accident or in other commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. as a result of plant operation. The scientific consensus is that in the decades following Three Mile Island, no deaths have been directly tied to illnesses resulting from radiation exposure.

However, the article notes that it can take more than a decade for radiation exposure to manifest itself as cancer, and it is difficult to pinpoint whether radiation exposure, smoking habits, or other factors caused a particular person's illness. Recent research suggests that Three Mile Island may have some deadly long-term effects. A major study conducted by the University of Pittsburgh found that adult men who received the highest doses of radiation from the accident are at greater risk for leukemia, and women with similar amounts of radiation exposure showed a higher risk of breast cancer.

While the prevailing view is that no deaths have been directly caused by the Three Mile Island accident, there is a minority view that the accident increased overall cancer deaths. Critics argue that there are too few peer-reviewed studies published in medical journals on the health effects of the disaster.

In conclusion, the article states that Isakson's claim reflects the prevailing view that no deaths have been caused by a commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. However, it also acknowledges that there is ongoing research suggesting that the long-term effects of the Three Mile Island accident may have resulted in deaths. Isakson's claim is limited to deaths caused by plant operations and does not include the long-term aftermath of a nuclear accident.

Isakson’s claim reflects the prevailing view that no deaths have been caused by a commercial nuclear reactor in the United States, even during the Three Mile Island accident. But there is ongoing research that suggests the long-term aftermath of the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island may have resulted in deaths. Isakson’s claim is limited to deaths caused by plant operations. It does not include the long-term aftermath of a nuclear accident."
410,"### Context: A recent study has found that a shorter treatment duration of the breast cancer drug Herceptin is just as effective as the standard 12-month treatment. The study, funded by the UK's National Institute for Health Research, involved over 4,000 women and found that about 90% of women were cancer-free after four years in both the six-month and 12-month treatment groups. The shorter treatment also reduced the number of women who had to stop treatment due to heart issues by half, to about 4%.

The article mentions that the current cost of Herceptin for a 12-month treatment is $76,700, but it is unclear how much the cost would be reduced with a six-month treatment. However, it is expected that the cost will go down as other pharmaceutical companies introduce similar drugs to the market.

The main motivation for reducing the overall course of Herceptin treatment was to minimize serious side effects, particularly cardiac toxicity. The study's main outcome, as described in the article, focused on the equivalency of the treatment duration and the reduction of harm. However, further analysis is still ongoing on other important outcomes, such as quality of life.

The article includes cautious positive reactions from various sources, including the Chief Medical Officer of Roche, the maker of Herceptin. However, it notes that the data is preliminary and cannot be reviewed yet, as no actual research has been released. The complete data will need to be reviewed by the scientific community to identify any important details or concerns.

The article quotes three sources: a study author, a representative from Roche, and an oncologist not involved in the study. It suggests that more information on these individuals would have been beneficial. It also mentions other studies that have evaluated different treatment durations for Herceptin, ranging from six months to two years, with inconclusive or no beneficial results.

The article emphasizes that more research is needed before any significant changes in medical practice can be made. It highlights that this study is the largest to date evaluating a shorter treatment duration for Herceptin and that it was not funded by the drug company. The article does not appear to rely on a news release.
Claim: Study Finds More Isn't Better for Roche Breast Cancer Drug
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This Bloomberg story reports study findings that show the targeted breast cancer drug Herceptin may be as effective with a six-month treatment period as it is with the currently recommended 12-month treatment period. The results, slated to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could mean fewer adverse events and significant cost savings for patients. The story also makes clear that this finding is not robust enough to change treatment guidelines yet and that other outcomes, such as quality of life improvement are still being analyzed. Herceptin has been a hugely successful drug, both for patients with a particular type of breast cancer (tumors with HER-2 receptors, which occur in about 20% of all breast cancers) and for the drug’s maker, Roche. Approved 20 years ago, doctors are still learning how best to manage the benefits and harms of the treatment. This study looks at one way of refining treatment — by shortening the duration, saving on costs, and reducing cardiac toxicity events.",Study Finds More Isn't Better for Roche Breast Cancer Drug,"This is a story about a study that found that a six-month course of the drug Herceptin was as effective as a 12-month course in treating HER2-positive breast cancer.

411,"### Context: Geron, a biopharmaceutical company, has announced that patients have dropped out of a clinical trial for its cancer drug, imetelstat. The company did not provide any reasons for the dropouts or if the study was stopped prematurely by the sponsor, the Mayo Clinic. Geron stated that the patients would continue to receive the drug and be monitored as per the study design. Analyst Brian Klein from Stifel Nicolaus & Co expressed concerns about the limited information provided by Geron, suggesting that the treatment may only be effective for a short period of time. The trial, which began in November 2012, was conducted for a group of blood cancers called myeloid malignancies. Klein also mentioned that the drug may only be suitable for patients with severe disease. Geron believes that the data from the 79 patients in the trial will be sufficient to support the drug's development. The company plans to conduct a mid-stage trial for imetelstat in patients with myelofibrosis, a rare blood disorder, in the first half of the year. In November, Geron reported that four out of the first 18 myelofibrosis patients enrolled in the Mayo Clinic's study were disease-free. Imetelstat is designed to inhibit telomerase, an enzyme that allows cancer cells to multiply rapidly. Following the announcement, Geron's shares fell by 18% to $4.60 in late-morning trading on the Nasdaq.

412,"### Context: The article debunks a conspiracy theory that claims the COVID-19 virus is being spread by 5G cellular towers. The video in question shows a person revealing a piece of equipment with the word ""COV-19"" inscribed on it, suggesting a connection between 5G technology and the virus. However, it is clarified that the equipment featured in the video is not from a 5G tower but rather a circuit board from an old set-top television box. The word ""COV-19"" is also deemed inauthentic, likely added to the circuit board to support the conspiracy theory.

The conspiracy theory combines two false notions. Firstly, concerns about the impact of mobile technology on human health have been exaggerated, as research from reputable sources like the World Health Organization has found no adverse health effects linked to wireless technologies. Secondly, various conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 have emerged, including the unfounded idea that it is a bio-weapon. Conspiracy theorists have tapped into these fears about mobile technology to spread rumors about the virus.

The man in the video claims not to be a conspiracy theorist but questions why ""COV-19"" is written on the 5G equipment. However, it is clarified that the equipment is not from a 5G tower, and the inscription was likely added to falsify evidence for the conspiracy theory. The article also mentions that screenshots from the video reveal the name of the actual manufacturer of the device, Hannstar.

In summary, the article debunks the conspiracy theory that suggests a connection between 5G technology and the spread of COVID-19. The video featuring the inscription ""COV-19"" on a piece of equipment is misleading, as the equipment is not from a 5G tower and the inscription is likely fabricated. The article emphasizes that concerns about the health effects of mobile technology are exaggerated and that the origins of COVID-19 are not linked to a bio-weapon.

The Facebook post shared a story about a man who was bitten by a rattlesnake. The bite was not severe, but his arm started to swell and his throat was getting tight. The emergency room immediately gave him Benadryl to treat the swelling and potential death of tissue. However, the Snakebite Foundation states that there is no truth to this claim.

The article does not provide any further information about the effectiveness of Benadryl in treating rattlesnake bites or any alternative treatments that should be used. It simply states that the claim is false according to the Snakebite Foundation.

414,"### Context: The claim that Bill White, a Democratic gubernatorial hopeful in Texas, presided over the construction of what may be the world's largest abortion clinic is not entirely true. Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas, which has been operating for over 75 years, plans to move to a new building that it began refurbishing in 2008 with $17 million in private donations. The new facility, a seven-story, 78,000-square-foot former bank building, will be the largest Planned Parenthood facility in the United States. It will include a surgical suite that offers the same services as the current location, which performs about 20 abortions per day. However, the mayor of Houston, including Bill White during his tenure, does not have a role in approving building permits for such facilities. The city issued Planned Parenthood a demolition permit in 2008 and subsequent building permits, but these do not require approval from the mayor or city council. The Houston Department of Health and Human Services also does not sign off on whether facilities can perform abortions; that responsibility lies with the state Department of State Health Services. Elena Marks, White's then-director of health and environmental policy, did serve on the board of directors for Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas from 1993-2004 and later joined the national board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. However, there is no position of Texas head of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and there is no evidence that Marks used her official position to ensure approval of the building permits. While White was mayor when Planned Parenthood started renovating the building, he was not directly responsible for the construction. Therefore, the claim made by the Texas GOP is deemed to be false.

415,"### Context: Lawmakers in South Dakota are preparing for a fast-paced legislative session, with limited time to act due to being in session for just 37 days over two months. Many lawmakers are prioritizing issues from last year, including expanding mental health and addiction treatment in rural areas with high suicide rates. The session will also address the state budget, with Governor Kristi Noem warning of lean times and recommending a hold on salary funding increases. Lawmakers are looking for a way to give raises and will closely monitor revenue figures throughout the session. The state's agriculture industry, which faced difficulties due to flooding and trade uncertainty, will also be a focus.

The session will also address the issue of industrial hemp, with Governor Noem stating that she will not veto a bill legalizing hemp if certain criteria are met. Lawmakers believe their plan already meets most of Noem's criteria and are ready to bring it up early in the session. The proposed law would allow farmers to grow hemp as long as they plant more than 5 acres and keep the THC content below 0.3%. The session will also address potential demonstrations against the Keystone XL pipeline, with Noem pushing for the prosecution of those who ""urge"" riots. Last year, laws aimed at prosecuting riot boosting were nullified by legal proceedings, and Noem has proposed new legislation that aims to permit free speech while prosecuting those who directly urge force or violence.

Lawmakers are also concerned about South Dakota's high suicide rate, particularly in rural areas, and will introduce bills to improve mental health resources. They aim to make mental health care accessible through virtual consultations, requiring broadband internet access in rural communities. Additionally, lawmakers will be looking for ways to help farmers recover from a difficult year and stimulate the state's economy.

Overall, the legislative session in South Dakota will address a range of issues, including the state budget, industrial hemp, potential demonstrations against the Keystone XL pipeline, mental health resources, and support for the agriculture industry.

416,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that cooking with aluminum foil can be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. It states that there has been a long-standing debate within the scientific community about the connection between aluminum and Alzheimer's. The claim is based on three assertions: that cooking with aluminum foil will release aluminum into the food, that this aluminum will reach the brain in significant concentrations, and that high concentrations of aluminum in the brain increase the risk of Alzheimer's.

The article confirms that cooking with aluminum foil can indeed result in the leaching of aluminum into the food. A study published in the International Journal of Electrochemical Science found that the amount of aluminum leached varied depending on factors such as temperature and acidity. However, most research agrees that the amount of leached aluminum that stays in the body is less than 1%.

Regarding the aluminum reaching the brain, the article cites the World Health Organization, which states that only a very small percentage of ingested aluminum ends up in the brain. The amount of aluminum needed to be regularly consumed to see a significant buildup in the brain is unrealistically large.

The article also addresses the debate over the connection between aluminum and Alzheimer's. While the brains of Alzheimer's patients have been found to have high concentrations of aluminum compounds, the official stance of organizations like the Alzheimer's Society of Canada and the international Alzheimer's Association is that aluminum is not a risk factor for the disease. The article mentions that some studies have found weak associations between living in areas with elevated aluminum levels in drinking water and an increased risk of Alzheimer's, but other studies have not found significant associations. The available data do not suggest that aluminum is a causative agent of Alzheimer's, but it is possible that it may play a role in the development of the disease.

In conclusion, the article confirms that cooking with aluminum foil can result in the ingestion of aluminum, but the amount that reaches the brain is minimal. The connection between aluminum and Alzheimer's disease remains controversial, with some studies suggesting a weak association but no consensus among experts.
Claim: Studies have demonstrated that cooking with aluminum foil can result in the ingestion of aluminum, which is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

418,"### Context: Chinese authorities are investigating 27 cases of infection after rumors on social media suggested that the outbreak could be linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization (WHO) is aware of the reports and is monitoring the situation, in contact with the Chinese government. However, the cause of the illness has not yet been confirmed. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic stated that there are several potential causes of viral pneumonia, many of which are more common than SARS.

Chinese municipal health officials in Wuhan have ruled out common respiratory diseases such as influenza, bird flu, and adenovirus infection as the cause of the illness. Eleven of the infected individuals are in critical condition, while the rest are stable. All patients have been isolated, and doctors are observing 121 people who had close contact with them. The seafood market where some victims were vendors has been cleaned up, and no obvious human-to-human transmission has been observed. No medical staff have been infected.

Singapore's health ministry has announced that it will begin temperature screening on passengers arriving on flights from Wuhan. This measure is being taken to prevent the spread of the illness.

In 2003, Chinese officials covered up a SARS outbreak for weeks before being forced to reveal the epidemic due to a growing death toll and rumors. The disease, which emerged in southern China in late 2002, spread rapidly to other cities and countries, infecting over 8,000 people and causing 775 deaths.

Wuhan police have summoned eight individuals who posted and forwarded false information online, causing adverse social impact.

Overall, the article highlights the investigation into the cause of a mysterious pneumonia outbreak in China. The authorities are ruling out common respiratory diseases and are in contact with the WHO. The article also mentions the previous cover-up of a SARS outbreak in China in 2003.

419,"### Context: The article discusses a proposed law in Uruguay that would legalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana. Currently, the use of cannabis and other drugs is legal in Uruguay, but the sale and cultivation are not. President Jose Mujica believes that this law will help combat smuggling gangs and reduce petty crime in the country. However, critics argue that it may lead to an increase in the use of harder drugs.

Under the proposed law, the state would be responsible for managing and regulating the marijuana trade from cultivation to distribution. The bill allows households to have up to six plants or 480 grams of marijuana. Cannabis consumers would be able to purchase a maximum of 40 grams per month. The law also outlines regulations for smoking clubs, which can have up to 15 members, 90 plants, and an annual production of up to 7.2 kilograms of marijuana.

To oversee the production and distribution of marijuana, a National Cannabis Institute would be created. This institute would also impose sanctions on those who break the rules and design educational policies to raise awareness about the risks of marijuana consumption.

The bill is expected to become law early next year, as President Mujica's allies control both houses of Congress. However, there is resistance from opposition legislators. Some opponents of the law argue that it may anger other governments in the region, such as Colombia, Mexico, and the United States, who are battling drug-related violence. President Barack Obama has previously stated that legalizing drugs could be just as corrupting, if not more corrupting, than the current situation.

In summary, the proposed law in Uruguay would legalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana. It aims to combat smuggling gangs and reduce petty crime in the country. The law allows households to have up to six plants or 480 grams of marijuana, and consumers can purchase a maximum of 40 grams per month. The state would oversee the production and distribution of marijuana through a National Cannabis Institute. The bill is expected to pass, despite opposition, and become one of the world's most permissive legislation on drugs.

420,"### Context: Republican Congressman Tom McClintock claimed that the flu killed 80,000 Americans last year, according to the CDC. However, this claim is misleading. The CDC initially estimated 80,000 deaths for the 2017-18 influenza season, but later revised it down to 61,000 deaths. McClintock's spokesperson stated that the congressman had not noticed the date of the news article he relied on, and it has since been brought to his attention that the CDC revised its number to 61,000. 

In reality, during the 2018-19 influenza season, 34,000 Americans died of the flu, according to the CDC. Comparing the flu and COVID-19, experts caution against it, as COVID-19 appears to be more lethal. Pound for pound, if someone had both viruses, the coronavirus is more likely to cause death. As of May 5, COVID-19 had killed 70,847 Americans.

In conclusion, McClintock's claim about flu deaths is misleading because he cited the wrong year and failed to acknowledge the CDC's downward revision of the death toll. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

421,"### Context: Dozens of child advocates, public policy experts, and doctors gathered at a summit to brainstorm ideas for Michelle Obama's campaign to combat childhood obesity. An interagency task force is reviewing US programs and policies on child nutrition and physical activity and is due to report to President Obama soon. The summit participants were asked to come up with three to five recommendations for the task force to consider. Some early suggestions included healthier foods in corporate cafeterias and linking public transportation to grocery store access. However, the audience particularly appreciated a California doctor's call for integrating short bursts of physical activity into the regular workplace and school routine. The experts' advice would help the task force develop measurable benchmarks for fighting childhood obesity.

Michelle Obama stated that the United States spends $150 billion annually to treat obesity-related conditions, and these costs are projected to almost double over the next decade. White House budget director Peter Orszag emphasized that the magnitude of obesity-associated health risks may not be fully appreciated, as having a body mass index in the obesity range is equivalent to aging 20 years in terms of chronic conditions faced. He added that while 40 may be the new 30, if someone is obese, unfortunately, 40 is the new 60.

The article is titled ""Routine 'recess' a hit at White House obesity summit,"" suggesting that the idea of incorporating physical activity into daily routines received positive feedback at the summit. Dr. Toni Yancey of the University of California Los Angeles proposed integrating short bursts of physical activity into the regular workplace and school routine, which was met with laughter and appreciation from the audience. This idea aligns with Michelle Obama's campaign to combat childhood obesity and the task force's goal of developing measurable benchmarks for fighting obesity.

Overall, the article highlights the efforts being made to address childhood obesity in the United States and the importance of incorporating physical activity into daily routines. The summit participants were tasked with providing recommendations to the interagency task force, and one suggestion that received positive feedback was integrating short bursts of physical activity into workplaces and schools. The article also emphasizes the significant costs associated with obesity-related conditions and the need to address this issue to improve public health.

422,"### Context: In a recent presidential debate, Donald Trump claimed that Hillary Clinton wants to move the United States to a single-payer system for healthcare, which he referred to as a ""disaster."" However, Clinton's healthcare plan does not call for a single-payer system. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies, and Clinton wants to protect and expand Obamacare, not replace it with a single-payer system. She supports a ""public option"" for Obamacare, which would allow people to buy into Medicare and provide more affordable healthcare options. Clinton has consistently said that she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by Republicans and has called for expanding it to include tax credits, eliminating out-of-network hospital charges, reducing prescription drug costs, and allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices. 

Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, also made a similar claim during the vice presidential debate, stating that Clinton and Tim Kaine want to expand Obamacare into a single-payer program. However, Clinton's campaign website indicates that she supports a public option, not a single-payer system. Trump's campaign spokesman pointed to comments Clinton made in 1994, where she predicted that the United States would have a single-payer system by the year 2000 if Congress didn't pass healthcare reform. However, Clinton also mentioned other ways to achieve universal health coverage, such as an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works.

In leaked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Clinton praised single-payer systems for keeping costs down but also mentioned that they impose wait times. However, she also praised countries like Switzerland for their clear budget controls and mentioned that they do not have a single-payer system.

Overall, Clinton's healthcare plan does not call for a single-payer system. While she supports a public option for Obamacare, she wants to protect and expand the existing program, not replace it with a single-payer system. Trump's claim that Clinton wants to move the United States to a single-payer plan is false.

423,"### Context: The article discusses the heartwarming story of Eric Schmitt-Matzen, a man who portrays Santa Claus, and his encounter with a terminally ill 5-year-old boy in a Tennessee hospital. Schmitt-Matzen received a call from a nurse asking him to visit the boy, and he arrived just moments before the child's death. He sat with the boy, gave him a present, and comforted him until he passed away. Schmitt-Matzen was deeply affected by the experience and initially considered giving up his role as Santa Claus. However, after seeing the joy he brought to other children, he decided to continue spreading happiness.

The article also mentions that the Knoxville News-Sentinel, the newspaper that first published Schmitt-Matzen's account, was investigating the story to verify its accuracy. Several hospitals in Knoxville were contacted, and they confirmed that the described visit did not take place at their facilities. The article raises questions about the privacy violations that may have occurred and mentions that the Tennessee Department of Health and the federal Department of Health and Human Services were contacted for comment.

The News-Sentinel later released a statement saying that they could not verify the story and were no longer standing by its veracity. However, another news outlet, WBIR-TV, claimed to have verified several critical details of the story but did not disclose the information. Schmitt-Matzen has reiterated his account of the visit, but the lack of vetting by multiple media outlets raises doubts about its authenticity.

In conclusion, the article discusses the story of a Tennessee boy who died in the arms of a man portraying Santa Claus during a hospital visit. The accuracy of the story is being questioned, as hospitals in the area have denied that the visit took place.

424,"### Context: The article addresses a claim circulating on Facebook that a warning label on a box of disposable masks proves their ineffectiveness in protecting against COVID-19. The photo of the label reads, ""This product is an ear loop mask, this product is not a respirator and will not provide any protections against COVID-19 (coronavirus) and other viruses or contaminants."" However, this claim is a misunderstanding of the label's meaning.

The article explains that certain medical-grade masks, like the N95 respirator, offer the most protection against viral particles because they can filter aerosol particles as small as 0.3 micron. However, other masks, such as ear-loop masks or homemade cloth masks, are effective in reducing the spread of the disease, known as ""source control."" These masks primarily protect those around the wearer.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the general public wear cloth face coverings in public settings to slow the spread of COVID-19. The CDC emphasizes that cloth masks are not intended to protect the wearer but rather to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others, especially if the wearer is infected but asymptomatic.

The article also mentions Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, who supports universal mask-wearing. Howard explains that masks serve different purposes as personal protective equipment and as a means of source control. The warning label on the box of disposable masks does not imply that they are ineffective at slowing the spread of the disease but rather that they do not provide the same level of protection as medical respirators like the N95.

In conclusion, the warning label on the box of disposable masks does not indicate their ineffectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19. It simply means that they do not offer the same level of protection as medical-grade masks. Disposable and homemade cloth masks are recommended for the general public to wear as a means of source control, protecting others in case the wearer is infected but asymptomatic.

Attorney General Gurbir Grewal and Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Catherine McCabe announced the lawsuits, which target a former metal-finishing plant in Newark, two dry cleaners in Trenton, a dump in Camden, a scrap yard in Kearny, and a gas station in East Orange. The state is seeking to recoup $500,000 in cleanup costs from the Nanes Metal Finishing plant in Newark, which operated from 1966 to 1994 and discharged chemicals into the groundwater, causing health issues such as kidney dysfunction and respiratory illness. The lawsuits are part of the Democratic administration's efforts to address environmental issues, which had been neglected under the previous Republican administration. The state aims to send a message that polluters will not be tolerated. The focus of the lawsuits is on communities with below-average median household incomes and predominantly nonwhite populations. The state has about 13,000 cases in its polluted site remediation program, and the six locations were chosen based on factors such as the defendants' ability to pay and the neglect of these areas, particularly in the state's poorest regions.

428,"### Context: The article discusses radio host and Fox News personality Glenn Beck's claim that the town of Wilmington, Ohio, has refused government assistance since losing jobs when DHL Express pulled out in 2008. Beck portrays Wilmington as a town that is pulling together through self-reliance and prayer to save itself. However, the article finds that Beck's claim is false and that Wilmington has indeed received government assistance.

After DHL announced the closing of its Wilmington air hub, elected officials at the city, state, and federal levels began seeking help for DHL workers. The federal government awarded a $3.87 million national emergency grant to Ohio in November 2008 specifically to provide job training and other aid to DHL workers in Wilmington and the surrounding area. Wilmington and Clinton County also received a second national emergency grant worth $4.1 million.

Furthermore, Wilmington and Clinton County benefited from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus bill, passed in February 2009. The area received $7,009,811 in stimulus money through September, which included funds for the Wilmington city schools, Clinton County Department of Jobs and Family Services, and the Clinton County Community Action Group.

The city of Wilmington itself received a $79,231 stimulus grant for crime prevention programs, a $167,392 grant for rural public transit vehicles, and about $4 million for road, curb, and sidewalk replacement. The Ohio Department of Development has also provided money to the Clinton County Port Authority and is offering assistance to Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services.

Wilmington Mayor David Raizk confirms that the city has sought government assistance to help its citizens and create jobs. He emphasizes that they are not looking for a handout but rather a hand up.

In conclusion, the article finds that Glenn Beck's claim that Wilmington has refused government assistance is false. The town has received significant government aid, including emergency grants and stimulus money. The article criticizes Beck for taking literary license in his portrayal of Wilmington and rates his statement as both false and ridiculous.

430,"### Context: The article discusses the approval of the immunotherapy drug avelumab (marketed as Bavencio) by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare form of skin cancer. However, the article highlights several important aspects that are missing from the news release.

Firstly, the article points out that the news release does not mention the cost of avelumab, which is reported by Bloomberg to be priced at $13,000 a month or $156,000 for a year of treatment. This omission is significant as it affects the accessibility and affordability of the drug for patients.

The news release also fails to provide information about the measurable benefits of avelumab. The article mentions a study in the Lancet Oncology which found that out of 88 patients who received at least one dose of avelumab, only 28 achieved an ""objective response"" within an average of about 10 months. This means that less than a third of the patients who took the drug saw positive results. The release may give the impression that the majority of patients experience tumor shrinkage, but even a 90% reduction in tumor mass does not guarantee longer survival for all patients.

Furthermore, the news release mentions that almost a third of patients in the trial ""with no hope at all of surviving"" benefited from the drug, but it does not clarify what ""no hope at all"" means or provide information about the disease stage of the patients in the trial.

The article also highlights the side effects of avelumab, which are not mentioned in the news release. These include lymphopenia, muscle inflammation or damage, and other disorders. Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in five patients.

Additionally, the news release does not provide information about the study upon which the FDA approval was based. The article reveals that 88 patients were enrolled in the trial and received at least one dose of avelumab over a 14-month period. The release also fails to provide data on the average survival for the disease following treatment.

The article concludes that the news release lacks important context and information, such as costs, measurable benefits, side effects, and comparisons to other therapies. It also notes that the release appropriately explains the significance of the FDA approval for avelumab as the first treatment for metastatic MCC, but it does not highlight that this is only a phase II study, and there is no direct evidence that the new treatment is better than existing therapies.
Claim: Immunotherapy Drug Becomes First Therapy Approved by FDA for Rare Skin Cancer
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"A new drug approval offers an opportunity to review the evidence with readers. This news release from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center about a newly approved drug for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare type of skin cancer, missed that chance. We understand the need to get the news out there and even to highlight a patient story, but there is enough evidence on benefits and risks associated with immunotherapy, not to mention costs, that news releases should give readers a fuller picture. Without that important information, the dramatic experience of the cancer patient in the release provides an overly optimistic picture of patient outcomes for everyone who may be diagnosed with this particular type of cancer. MCC is a rare, often aggressive type of skin cancer, with about 1,500 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. The 5-year survival rate for MCC is estimated at around 60 percent, according to MayoClinic.org. This is the first drug approved for treating MCC — but not the only recognized treatment for the disease. Some of the media interest in the approval relates to the rapidity with which the FDA approved it while awarding the drug several special designations — accelerated approval, priority review, breakthrough therapy and orphan drug status, the latter of which “provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases,” according to the FDA’s news release on the approval. Readers should keep in mind that the evidence for the drug is limited and based on a small study of short duration.",Immunotherapy Drug Becomes First Therapy Approved by FDA for Rare Skin Cancer,"This news release from EurekAlert!, a news release distribution service, announces the FDA approval of avelumab (marketed as Bavencio) for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer.

However, the release does not provide costs, measurable benefits, side effects, or comparisons to other therapies.

The incident allegedly occurred at Port Aventura's Ferrari Land. However, it is revealed that the article is not true and was lifted from a Spanish-language website called Hay Noticia, which specializes in fictional content for humor and entertainment purposes. The website's disclaimer clearly states that its content is fictional and does not correspond to reality. Similarly, the disclaimer of the website 8Shit, which published the article, also states that their content is fictional. Therefore, the claim that a tourist's stomach upset caused fecal matter to splash on other customers is false.

432,"### Context: The article discusses a small pilot study that explored the potential of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The study involved three patients with Alzheimer's who underwent DBS surgery, which involves implanting a device in the brain that delivers electrical impulses. The article mentions that DBS surgery for Parkinson's disease costs $35,000 to $50,000.

The article criticizes the story for confusing readers with a headline that suggests the device ""might help slow Alzheimer's"" while the study itself only focuses on the clinical outcomes of the three patients. It points out that the fact that two of the three patients declined at a slower rate compared to a database of 96 patients does not prove the device's effectiveness. The article also highlights the risks of surgery and the lack of rigorous safety tests for medical devices.

The article mentions that the study did not provide specific data on the patients' outcomes and what was measured. It also notes that the story fails to mention the known risk of depression associated with DBS and that all three subjects in the study were treated with antidepressant medication.

The article questions whether the study should have been brought to the attention of consumer news readers due to the limited evidence and small sample size. It suggests that the story could have explored the science behind DBS and the challenges of studying it in Alzheimer's patients instead.

The article includes a useful comment from Keith Fargo of the Alzheimer's Association, who states that it is too early for patients or caregivers to seek out this device. It also mentions that medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory and that DBS would not be suitable for everyone.

Overall, the article criticizes the story for its misleading headline, lack of specific data, failure to mention risks, and premature presentation of the study's findings. It suggests that the story could have provided a more balanced and informative perspective on the potential of DBS as a treatment for Alzheimer's.
Claim: Brain 'Pacemaker' Might Help Slow Alzheimer’s
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story reports on a “proof of concept” study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to improve behavioral and cognitive function in Alzheimer’s patients, which involves implanting an electrical pulse generator under the skin to alter brain activity. To its credit, the story cautions that this is not anywhere close to being a readily available treatment. However, it neglects significant potential harms of using an implantable device and isn’t completely clear on the lack of a proven benefit. We think this study was one of those that isn’t quite ready for a consumer news audience; it’s just too preliminary and has the potential to stoke false hope. Authors of this study point out that Alzheimer’s disease is not just a memory problem but rather presents a host of cognitive and behavioral impairments, and even “small treatment advances” could have a meaningful impact by delaying their progress. DBS has been widely used with patients with Parkinson’s disease and other conditions, they say, and research suggests the technique can improve cognitive, behavioral and functional impairments. Also, any treatments involving medical devices should include cautions about potential harms, as described in our toolkit on medical device safety.",Brain 'Pacemaker' Might Help Slow Alzheimer’s,"The story reports on a small pilot study of three Alzheimer’s patients who underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS involves implanting a device in the brain that delivers electrical impulses. The story does a good job of explaining the procedure and the risks of surgery. However, the story is misleading in its headline, which suggests the device “might help slow Alzheimer’s.” The story itself is based on the clinical outcomes of the three patients. The story should have been more clear that the study did not prove the device’s effectiveness. The story also should have mentioned the known risk of depression associated with DBS and that all three subjects were treated with antidepressant medication. The story also should have provided more specific data on the patients’ outcomes and what was measured. The story also should have explored the science behind DBS and the challenges of studying it in Alzheimer’s patients. The story also should have included a comment from Keith Fargo of the Alzheimer’s Association, who says: “It’s too early for patients or caregivers to seek out this device. It’s a very early study. It’s a pilot study. It’s a small study. It’s not conclusive. It’s not going to be something that’s going to be available for a long time.”"
433,"### Context: The article titled ""Old drug could cure HIV-linked dementia"" discusses a preliminary trial of an off-label use of an anti-seizure medication called valproic acid for the treatment of HIV-related dementia. The article mentions that the cost of the drug is not specified, but it is not essential for the piece. The article does not provide any quantitative data from the study, such as the number of people who showed improvement or the extent of improvement. It also does not mention the number of brain scans that showed positive changes or how positive changes were measured.

The article fails to mention the potential side effects of taking valproic acid, which may include liver toxicity, dizziness, upset stomach, and acid reflux disease. It also does not provide enough information about the study design, which involved 22 patients, 6 of whom had no cognitive impairment and 16 who did. The study lasted for 10 weeks, and while there was a trend towards improvement, cognitive improvement did not significantly change between the placebo and valproic acid groups. However, there was an increase in frontal white matter in the treatment arm of cognitively impaired participants, which is seen as evidence of the drug's effectiveness.

The article acknowledges the need for a larger clinical trial to replicate the results and mentions that the small sample size of 22 patients limits the generalizability of the findings. It also notes that there is currently no cure for HIV-related dementia. The article does not provide information about other established or experimental treatment options for HIV-related dementia.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, and the researchers have no conflicts of interest, although this information is not mentioned in the article. The article states that valproic acid is not yet FDA approved for the treatment of HIV-related dementia and does not provide information on how to enroll in clinical trials.

Overall, the article is satisfactory but could have provided more information on the cost of the drug, quantitative data from the study, side effects, study design, prevalence or progression of dementia in HIV, and other treatment options. It also lacks input from independent sources and may have relied solely on a news release.
Claim: Old drug could cure HIV-linked dementia
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Patients with HIV may develop dementia as a result of the virus in the brain or inflammation as a result of the illness. The typical symptoms of HIV-associated dementia include short-term memory loss, slowing of thinking, difficulties with complex tasks, and social withdrawal. Neurological symptoms such as hand tremor and gait difficulties are also common. This story is about a study that tested an anti-seizure medication, valproic acid (Depakote), on cognitive functioning in 22 patients in over a 10-week period. 16 people in the study had HIV-related cognitive impairment, while 6 did not. Valproic acid is FDA approved to prevent seizures, but it is currently also used off-label for treatment of certain mental illnesses and in Alzheimer’s patients, as it is thought to prevent or reverse cognitive decline. The storyâ€™s description of study design and results is incomplete and there is no quantitative data presented on benefits or side effects. The study only lasted 10 weeks, and while there was a trend towards improvement, the story made no explanation of what â€œimprovementâ€ means or how it was measured or in how many people it was observed. It is important that the journalist mentions the need for a larger clinical trial to replicate results. 22 people is a very small sample to suggest generalizability of the results in terms of treating HIV dementia with valproic acid, so the headline is overzealous. There is still no “cure” for HIV-related dementia and current non-experimental options for treating this condition are not mentioned. The story doesnâ€™t mention side effects of taking valproic acid. The quote that it is “safe and well-tolerated by this population” does not provide enough information for a piece reporting the results of a published study. Also, 10 weeks is not enough time to assess long-term side effects for this medication in HIV patients. Anti-convulsant drugs like Depakote can have serious side effects when taken long term. These include weight gain, edema, sleepiness, gastrointestinal problems and liver toxicity.",Old drug could cure HIV-linked dementia,"This is a story about a small, preliminary trial of an anti-seizure drug, valproic acid, for the treatment of HIV-related dementia.

434,"### Context: Evofem's birth control gel has met its main study goal, causing shares to rise. The gel, known as Amphora, is a non-hormonal contraceptive that is applied by women before intercourse. The gel works by maintaining the vaginal pH at a level that is inhospitable to sperm. The study involved 1,400 women and found that the gel had an 86% efficacy rate in preventing pregnancy. However, it is important to note that this efficacy rate is based on just one industry study and the gel was only studied for seven menstrual cycles. The article mentions that the gel may also have some effectiveness against certain sexually transmitted diseases, but there is no data to support this claim yet. The article briefly mentions that no serious side effects were observed in the study, but does not provide information on less serious side effects. The study details were provided by the company and the fact that the study has not been published or peer-reviewed is not mentioned. The article quotes the CEO of Evofem as well as two business analysts, but does not include comments from independent physicians or researchers. The article also misleads readers by claiming that the gel is the first hormone-free contraceptive close to approval, when there are already hormone-free products on the market. The article does not provide information on the cost of the gel. Overall, the article provides some information on the study and the potential benefits of the gel, but lacks important details and independent expert opinions.
Claim: Evofem's birth control gel meets main study goal; shares rise
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Reuters reports on a new birth control product, still in development phase, that showed good efficacy, at least according to an unpublished company study. The product, a gel that lowers vaginal pH to make a hostile environment for sperm, would add a new contraceptive option to a lucrative market. However, the story focuses on company success — increasing stock value and stoking excitement in investment circles — more than the specifics of the product or the details of the company-sponsored study. No study limitations are mentioned. This leaves both investors and lay audiences without enough information to evaluate how useful the new product will be, should it pass muster with the FDA. There are a wide variety of birth control products on the market, but there’s also plenty of room for something new. A product that’s easy to use, effective, with few side effects, and that women control — the birth control gel sure sounds like it could make an impact. However, future consumers will want to know a lot more information than was provided in this story — how much will it cost, will it be available over-the-counter, how effective is it in real use, will side effects crop up once it’s in wide distribution? With an as-yet unapproved product, these answers won’t become clear for awhile, yet we think they should be considered — for consumers and investors alike.",Evofem's birth control gel meets main study goal; shares rise,"This story reports on a study of a non-hormonal birth control gel that is applied to the vagina before sex.

435,"### Context: The article debunks the claim that President Donald Trump declared himself as the ""second coming of God,"" the ""King of Israel,"" or the ""chosen one."" The claim originated from a meme posted by the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats, which attributed quotes to Trump that he did not actually say. While speaking with reporters about the U.S.-China trade war, Trump did say ""I am the chosen one,"" but it is likely that he was speaking tongue-in-cheek or for rhetorical effect. He was discussing his role in taking on China economically. The concept of a ""chosen one"" has various religious and secular connotations and can be used as a figure of speech. Trump never declared himself as the ""King of Israel"" or the ""second coming of God."" He did quote conspiracy theorist Wayne Allyn Root, who said that Jewish people in Israel love Trump like he is the King of Israel or the second coming of God. However, Root was using exaggerated language as part of a simile, and Trump was not endorsing those beliefs. The claim that Trump declared himself as the King of Israel or the second coming of Christ is inaccurate.

436,"### Context: The claim that autism has been included among the known side effects of the DTaP vaccine is misleading. The claim is based on a blog post from 2016 that circulated in anti-vaccine circles on social media. The blog post included a sensationalist title and a photograph of the vaccine insert that listed autism as a reported adverse effect. However, the blog post failed to include crucial context, such as the fact that the listed effect was a post-approval, unverified user-reported one that does not establish a causal relationship to the vaccine.

The article also mentions that the vaccine insert was current as of December 2005, making the information outdated by the time of the blog post in 2016. It is important to note that the prominent medical journal, The Lancet, did not formally retract a controversial 1998 research paper linking vaccines to autism until February 2010. The retraction came after years of investigation and revealed that the lead author of the paper had financial and scientific conflicts of interest.

The article explains that adverse event labeling includes all documented reports, regardless of their link to the drug in question. The FDA's guidance on adverse event-related drug labeling states that adverse reactions listed in the labeling are based on voluntary reports and do not establish a causal relationship to the drug.

In summary, the claim that autism has been included among the known side effects of the DTaP vaccine is misleading. The information is based on an outdated vaccine insert and fails to consider the lack of evidence establishing a causal relationship between the vaccine and autism. The retraction of the 1998 research paper linking vaccines to autism further discredits the claim.
Claim: Autism has now been included among the known side effects of the  DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and acellular Pertussis) vaccine.

437,"### Context: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pushing for a bill that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which leading Democratic committee chairmen claim would save the government $500 billion over 10 years. The savings would be used to fund new Medicare benefits and address health care priorities such as the National Institutes of Health and the opioid crisis. However, the bill is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate, as most Republicans oppose authorizing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. President Donald Trump, who initially supported giving Medicare negotiating power, now opposes Pelosi's bill. The White House argues that the bill would prevent up to one-third of new drugs from entering the market over a decade, a claim that the Congressional Budget Office disputes. Pelosi's bill would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for expensive drugs, including insulin, using lower prices paid in other economically advanced countries as a reference point. The bill would also impose steep sales taxes on the medications to force companies to negotiate. Budget analysts estimate that the legislation would reduce industry revenues by $500 billion to $1 trillion over 10 years. Trump is supporting a competing bill in the Senate that would require drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare if they increase prices above inflation. Both the House and Senate bills would cap out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients. The White House released a report arguing that Pelosi's bill would harm American patients by hindering the development and market entry of breakthrough drugs. The chances of a deal between Pelosi, Trump, and congressional lawmakers of both parties appear slim, particularly in the midst of an impeachment process. Medicare currently has gaps in coverage, particularly for dental, vision, and hearing services. Many seniors pay out-of-pocket for these services or rely on limited benefits offered through private Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, a government report found that prices for prescription drugs purchased at pharmacies decreased by 1% last year, marking the first drop since the 1970s.

438,"### Context: The article discusses the controversy surrounding Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's stance on mandatory ultrasounds before abortions. Initially, McDonnell expressed support for legislation requiring physicians to conduct an ultrasound and present the image of the fetus to the mother before performing an abortion. However, several hours later, it was revealed during a Senate debate that the bill would require invasive transvaginal ultrasounds, even against a woman's will, to obtain an image of the fetus in the early stages of pregnancy. This revelation sparked widespread criticism, with the bill being referred to as ""state-sanctioned rape"" and drawing ridicule from various media outlets.

In response to the backlash, McDonnell urged the Republican-controlled General Assembly to amend the bill so that no woman would be required to have a transvaginal ultrasound. He stated that he had been initially unaware of the invasive nature of the procedure and that he believed other procedures could be used to determine the gestational age of the child. The House amended the bill as requested by the governor, and it is currently pending in the Senate.

The article argues that McDonnell did not reverse his position on mandatory ultrasounds before abortions. He initially endorsed the general concept of mandating ultrasounds, but he was unaware that the legislation would require transvaginal ultrasounds. The article concludes that there is no evidence of McDonnell endorsing or defending the mandatory use of the invasive procedure. It also states that McDonnell did not alter his support for requiring non-invasive, external ultrasounds before abortions.

Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding McDonnell's stance on mandatory ultrasounds before abortions and clarifies that he did not change his position but rather was unaware of the invasive nature of the procedure specified in the legislation.

439,"### Context: The St. Paul Pioneer Press published a shortened version of an AP story about the risks and benefits of insulin pump use among adolescents. The article accurately communicates the potential harms of insulin pump use and the need to address safety concerns. It mentions the cost of devices and monthly supplies, which the original AP story did not include. However, the article could have improved by highlighting the importance of parental oversight in preventing adverse events, as three of the five deaths occurred without parental supervision. The article includes key findings and conclusions from a Pediatrics study, but fails to mention that it was a retrospective study and its limitations. It also does not provide the denominator of subjects involved in the study. The article accurately summarizes the prevalence of adverse events related to insulin pump usage in adolescents without sensationalism. It provides useful background information on Type 1 diabetes for context. The original AP story included perspectives from an independent expert and the editor of a patient newsletter, but the Pioneer Press deleted these perspectives and included a quote from a local insulin pump manufacturer instead. The article appropriately references multiple daily insulin injections as the standard treatment option for Type 1 diabetes. It establishes the availability of insulin pumps in its lead sentence by stating that they are used by tens of thousands of teenagers worldwide. The article accurately indicates that insulin pumps have been available and used for many years. There is no evidence that the AP story relied solely or largely on a news release.
Claim: Problems spur FDA caution on insulin pump
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"First, let’s be clear that this is a review of an Associated Press story as shortened by the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Some of the flaws commented on were not present in the original AP story. The story was about a 10-year retrospective study of adverse events resulting from adolescent use of insulin pumps conducted by the FDA and published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics. Insulin pumps are being used more often to deliver insulin to the body through a plastic tube with a small tip that inserts under the skin. The article provides a good description of the pumps, indicating that they are approximately the size of a cell phone and can be worn on a belt or kept in a pocket. Insulin pumps have been primarily used by adults but are now being used more often by adolescents because it allows them to lead more normal lives by eliminating the need for them to give themselves insulin injections in public. The results of adverse events reported by in the FDA study, including 13 deaths and more than 1,500 pump-related injuries over the past decade, were accurately presented. However, no denominator was given so the numbers lose context and meaning. Estimated causes of these adverse events – patient misuse, lack of education, and device malfunction – were also described. A notable omission from the story was the importance of parental supervision as three of the 13 deaths occurred when there was no adult supervision. The original AP story provided a good overall summary of the health concerns related to insulin pump use among adolescents and the need for for more study to address safety concerns. But all for the sake of cutting 290 words, the St. Paul Pioneer Press version lost:    any discussion of cost – something lacking in about 75% of all stories we review. (And at a time when the US devotes 16% of the GDP to health care spending!) the emphasis on the parental oversight issue the perspectives of two other knowledgeable sources  Yet it left in a defensive comment from the Medtronic company ""which makes the top-selling insulin pump.""

440,"### Context: The article in question claims that a new study has found a significant association between the flu vaccine and an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. However, this claim is misleading and lacks strong evidence.

The article cites a 2019 study conducted by the U.S. Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch, which was published in the journal Vaccine in 2020. The study focused on Department of Defense personnel and aimed to determine if the seasonal flu vaccine made individuals more or less likely to catch other respiratory viruses. Importantly, the study did not investigate the connection between the flu vaccine and COVID-19.

The study's data referred to seasonal common coronaviruses in 2017-18, not the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, and the study found no connection between the flu shot and an increased risk of contracting these common coronaviruses.

Richard Watanabe, a preventative medicine professor at USC, stated that the article does not provide strong support for its claims. The study found little correlation between the flu vaccine and respiratory viruses, even those that predated COVID-19. The study concluded that further research is needed and that there is little evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination.

The article also fails to mention parts of the study that question the data linking coronavirus cases to the influenza vaccine. A 2013 study referenced by the U.S. Armed Forces study found no association between influenza vaccination and various respiratory viruses.

In conclusion, the headline of the article, which claims a significant association between the flu vaccine and an increased risk of COVID-19, is misleading. The study it cites does not investigate COVID-19 but rather focuses on common coronaviruses that circulated in 2017-18. The study found no connection between the flu vaccine and an increased risk of contracting these common coronaviruses. The article also omits information that questions the data linking coronavirus cases to the influenza vaccine. Overall, the claim made in the headline is not supported by strong evidence, and the article is misleading.

441,"### Context: The claim that Koobface is ""spreading like wildfire"" on Facebook is largely a hoax. Koobface is a real piece of malware that started circulating in late 2008 through social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. However, since mid-2010, warnings about Koobface have mutated into versions that are mostly hoaxes.

The article mentions that social networking sites, including Facebook, have increased their protection against malware outbreaks like Koobface. As a result, Koobface has largely stopped using these sites as a means of transmission. Therefore, the claim that Koobface is spreading rapidly on Facebook is not accurate.

The article also states that there is no evidence that Koobface was ever widely spread through messages related to the ""Barack Obama Clinton Scandal."" This suggests that the warning about this specific message is likely another hoax.

Additionally, the warning about a user named ""SmartGirl15"" adding people on Facebook and spreading the virus is also mentioned as another updating of a long-running internet hoax. This further supports the idea that the claim about Koobface spreading rapidly on Facebook is not true.

The article provides information about how Koobface initially spread in 2008. It explains that the malware was distributed through emails with subject lines offering recipients links to video sites that appeared to contain movie clips. When users clicked on these links, they were prompted to download a file to update their Adobe Flash software. However, this download actually contained the malicious Koobface code.

The article concludes by mentioning that Facebook has sent instructions to users whose accounts may have been compromised by Koobface. These instructions include running anti-virus software to remove any harmful programs and keep their information secure.

In summary, the claim that Koobface is ""spreading like wildfire"" on Facebook is largely a hoax. While Koobface is a real piece of malware, it has largely stopped using social networking sites as a means of transmission. There is no evidence that Koobface was widely spread through messages related to the ""Barack Obama Clinton Scandal,"" and the warning about ""SmartGirl15"" is another internet hoax.

442,"### Context: The article discusses the approval of a new drug called Lynparza for the treatment of breast cancer in patients with inherited BRCA gene mutations. The drug, manufactured by AstraZeneca, will cost $13,886 per month without insurance. The manufacturer is offering financial assistance to help cover the cost, but it is unclear whether the assistance will cover the full cost or a percentage of it. The article does not compare the cost of Lynparza to other treatments or address whether insurance companies are expected to cover it.

Lynparza has been found to modestly delay the time until cancer worsens compared to commonly used chemotherapies. About half of the study participants responded to Lynparza, while only a quarter responded to chemotherapy alone. However, it is unknown whether the treatment increases survival. The drug claims no benefit in terms of extending survival, which is the most vital outcome.

Possible side effects of Lynparza include blood and bone marrow cancers, nausea, fatigue, respiratory infections, and blood count problems. The drug can also cause harm to a developing fetus, so women should be advised of the potential risk and use effective contraception. Breastfeeding while taking Lynparza can also harm a newborn baby.

The article does not provide information on the duration of the study or further testing needed to determine if responses may vary among different subsets of patients. It also does not clarify the number of breast cancer patients who might be candidates for this drug. The article mentions that about 20-25% of patients with hereditary breast cancers have a BRCA mutation, but it does not state how many people diagnosed with breast cancer actually have this mutation.

The article quotes Dr. Susan M. Domchek at the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center without stating her institution's role in the clinical trial. It briefly mentions chemotherapy as an alternative treatment but does not provide further details. The article also mentions the approval of a companion blood test to look for BRCA genes, but it is unclear if this test will be required before women receive the new drug and if it will be available right away.

Overall, the article heavily relies on news releases from AstraZeneca and the FDA and does not contain any independent sources. It could have provided more information on the cost comparison, insurance coverage, study limitations, and the number of patients who might benefit from the drug.
Claim: US OKs 1st drug aimed at women with inherited breast cancer
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story reports on the FDA’s first approval of a drug to treat certain patients with metastatic breast cancer who have a “BRCA” gene mutation. The story addresses costs and laudably notes that the supporting study doesn’t address a key outcome: patient survival. However, it reports mainly from news releases, misses some important study limitations, and doesn’t include independent voices. Certain breast cancers that affect women with inherited BRCA gene mutations are relatively small in number but difficult to treat, and they can disproportionately affect young women. As a result, drugs to treat these cancers are likely to be important news for certain patients and their families. The FDA gave its “priority review” status to olaparib, meaning it determined the drug “would significantly improve the safety or effectiveness of treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition.” It’s dependent upon news stories to help put that into context that people understand–does it actually “significantly” improve patient lives?",US OKs 1st drug aimed at women with inherited breast cancer,"This is a story about a new drug, called Lynparza, that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer in women who have a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The drug is a “first of its kind” in that it is the first drug that targets the BRCA mutation. The story does a good job of describing the drug and its potential side effects. However, the story does not provide any quantification of the benefits of the drug, which is a significant omission. The story also does not mention the cost of the drug, which is a significant issue given that the drug is a new, expensive treatment.

443,"### Context: A 9-year-old boy in France has become the country's first fatality from a likely COVID-19-linked illness. The boy suffered a heart attack at home, resulting in brain damage that led to his death. The details of the case were released by La Timone hospital in Marseille. The child had spent six days in intensive care after his heart attack on May 2. Prior to the heart attack, the boy had been taken to an emergency ward in another hospital, where a pediatrician diagnosed symptoms similar to scarlet fever. However, the boy did not exhibit serious signs and was sent home. A few hours later, he suffered a heart attack and was rushed to La Timone hospital. Blood tests revealed that the boy had been infected with COVID-19 in the previous weeks, although he did not have symptoms and was no longer positive for the virus when admitted to the hospital. Some of the boy's symptoms resembled those of Kawasaki disease, a rare blood vessel disorder. Around 125 children in France have developed Kawasaki-like symptoms during the coronavirus outbreak, raising concerns of a possible link. The death at La Timone hospital was the first in France linked to this syndrome. The boy died on May 8. Doctors outside of France have also reported an increase in cases involving children with inflammations that required intensive care and other symptoms. Symptoms seen in affected children in France include persistent high fevers, intense fatigue, rashes, and stomach pains. Some of the children tested positive for COVID-19, but it is unclear whether the symptoms are caused by the virus or something else. The World Health Organization is studying this condition, which has similarities to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.

444,"### Context: The article examines the claim made by the Yes on 55 campaign that if California's Proposition 55 fails, there will be $4 billion in new cuts to the state's public schools. Proposition 55 is a measure on the November ballot that seeks to extend an income tax hike on wealthy residents. The article provides background information on Proposition 30, a temporary tax increase approved by voters in 2012 to fund schools. Proposition 55 aims to continue the higher income tax rate for 12 additional years, but not the sales tax increase.

The article acknowledges that the failure of Proposition 55 would result in less money for public schools. The California Legislative Analyst's Office projects that Proposition 55 would raise between $2 billion and $4.5 billion annually for K-12 schools and community colleges, depending on the economy. However, even if Proposition 55 fails, school funding would continue to increase through 2019-2020 due to revenue from Proposition 30. By 2019-2020, school costs would outpace total revenue by $4 billion, based on the end of Proposition 30 and expected inflation.

The article also mentions a separate $4 billion operating shortfall projected for the 2019-2020 fiscal year, which would affect various services, including schools. While there is no specific law requiring school spending cuts to close these shortfalls, it is likely that schools would experience cuts. However, the Legislative Analyst's Office predicts a nearly $2 billion operating surplus in 2019-2020, contradicting the projected shortfall.

The article concludes that the Yes on 55 campaign's claim is not entirely accurate. While there would be less money for schools if Proposition 55 fails, the advertisements fail to mention that Proposition 30 was a temporary measure and that school budgets will continue to increase until the revenue from Proposition 30 runs out after 2018. The claim also does not consider the conflicting projections of an operating surplus in 2019-2020. The article rates the claim as containing some element of truth but ignoring critical facts that would give a different impression.
Claim: California’s Prop 55 ""prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The Yes on 55 campaign claimed in recent ads that ""Prop 55 prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools."" There would certainly be less money for schools if the tax extension fails. But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55’s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measure’s failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And that’s not the case.","California’s Prop 55 ""prevents $4 billion in new cuts to our schools.","The Yes on 55 campaign says that if California’s Prop 55 fails, there will be """"$4 billion in new cuts to our schools.""""

445,"### Context: House Bill 330 in North Carolina aims to protect drivers who inadvertently injure protesters in the street. The bill was introduced in response to protests in Charlotte last fall and was approved by the N.C. House of Representatives but has not been considered by the state Senate. The bill drew renewed scrutiny after the car attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, sparking fears that drivers in North Carolina could hit protesters without legal repercussions. Governor Roy Cooper called for legislators to let the bill die, stating that it grants immunity to motorists who strike protesters.

The bill's authors, Republican state Reps. Justin Burr and Chris Millis, argue that the bill is ""tightly tailored"" to protect drivers and people lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights. The bill provides legal immunity from personal-injury lawsuits to motorists who exercise ""due care"" when driving but injure someone who blocks traffic while participating in a protest. However, the bill does not apply to drivers who injure protesters through ""willful or wanton"" actions, those who injure someone with a permit to protest, or those being criminally prosecuted.

Legal experts doubt that the bill would have much impact because state laws already offer broad protections to drivers who accidentally hit people unlawfully in the street. In North Carolina, state laws apply the doctrine of ""contributory negligence,"" meaning that if a plaintiff is even 1 percent responsible for their injuries, they lose automatically. The bill does not change much about civil litigation.

If the bill were to pass, protesters would have to prove ""willful and wanton"" intent if they believe a driver intentionally struck them. Attorneys argue that the bill might inspire violent acts by people who don't understand the laws, but it is unclear whether the bill would actually change litigation or offer additional protections.

In conclusion, the claim that House Bill 330 grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters is overstated. Legal experts argue that the bill does not change much about civil litigation and may not offer any additional protections at all.
Claim: House Bill 330 ""grants immunity from liability to motorists who strike protesters.

446,"### Context: The article titled ""Wine and coffee lovers, drink up! It's great for your microbiome"" discusses a recent study that explores the relationship between certain foods and the diversity of the gut microbiome. The article claims that drinking wine and coffee is beneficial for the microbiome, but the author argues that the article fails to provide evidence to support this claim.

The author points out that the study mentioned in the article is not a ""treatment"" study, so discussing costs is not relevant. However, the way the article is written may lead readers to believe that they should consume more wine and coffee, which is not what the findings of the study showed. The author criticizes the lack of quantification of the benefits claimed in the article, stating that there is no evidence to support the idea that drinking wine or coffee is ""great for your microbiome.""

The author also highlights the absence of information regarding the dosage of wine and coffee that would be beneficial. Without this information, readers may consume more than is beneficial, potentially leading to unhealthy or dangerous outcomes. The research mentioned in the article is purely observational, and the author emphasizes that it is not possible to conclude that increased consumption of wine and coffee leads to greater microbiome diversity or if that is even important for overall health.

The article is criticized for using cause/effect language, implying that consuming certain foods directly leads to increased microbial diversity. The author argues that the story should have included a clear disclaimer regarding the limitations of this type of research.

The article is commended for not engaging in disease-mongering and for not having any conflicts of interest. However, the author notes that the article did not include independent sources. Despite this, the author believes that given the context of the research, independent sources are not necessary.

The article is acknowledged for establishing the novelty of the research by quoting one of the researchers involved in the study. This suggests that the article did not solely rely on a news release.

In conclusion, the author argues that the article fails to provide evidence to support the claim that drinking wine and coffee is beneficial for the microbiome. The lack of quantification, dosage information, and clear disclaimers regarding the limitations of the research are highlighted as major issues with the article.

The shot is also being reviewed by U.S. health regulators and a decision is expected in the first quarter of next year. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects. Since the middle of last year, the Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people, making it the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, after the 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300. “The EU is supporting international efforts to combat Ebola on all fronts, from vaccine development to delivering humanitarian aid on the ground,” EU Ebola Coordinator Christos Stylianides said in a statement dated Nov. 10. Merck has said its priority was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine “can be used to support global public health preparedness”.

448,"### Context: A study conducted as part of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project has found a potential association between high fried fish consumption and increased stroke deaths. The study analyzed data from over 21,000 participants across the United States and found that in the ""stroke belt"" region, where stroke rates are already higher, the risk of stroke death was further increased in areas with high fried fish consumption. The study did not discuss the cost of fried fish.

The article emphasizes that the study was observational and cannot establish a causal link between fried fish consumption and stroke risk. Independent experts quoted in the article caution that the study only shows an association and cannot prove causation. They suggest that more research is needed to determine if cooking methods affect stroke risk.

The article also mentions possible reasons for the association between fried fish and stroke risk. One theory is that frying the fish may leach out the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. Another possibility is that the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke risk. The types of fish commonly used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be lower in healthy fats.

The article includes quotes from stroke neurologists who praise the study but emphasize the need for caution in interpreting the results. They highlight that the study cannot establish a direct link between fried fish consumption and stroke risk.

The article does not engage in disease mongering or exaggerate the concern about stroke in the ""stroke belt"" region. It also mentions a helpful sidebar that provides information about alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids.

Overall, the article provides a summary of the study's findings and includes analysis from independent experts. It acknowledges the limitations of the study and the need for further research to determine the impact of cooking methods on stroke risk.

The story would have been stronger if it had mentioned that the study could not prove a causal link between fried fish and stroke risk. The study only showed an association. The story also would have been stronger if it had mentioned that the types of fish commonly used for frying (i.e. cod and haddock) tend to be lower in healthy fats. This is an important point because it suggests that the cooking method may be the factor that is increasing stroke risk.

The image is proven to be false as the driver of the sports car is actually rapper Kanye West. The article also highlights the contrast between the perceived humility of Pope Francis and the prosperity gospel preached by Creflo Dollar. Pope Francis is known for his simplicity and modesty, while Dollar is known for preaching the idea that God wants believers to prosper in all aspects of their lives, including finances. Dollar has been associated with luxury cars in the past, but currently drives a regular Mercedes Benz S-Class sedan. The article also mentions the wealth of the Catholic Church, with hundreds of millions of Euros tucked away and the Vatican bank managing billions of dollars in assets. The difference between the ideologies of the Catholic Church and the prosperity gospel is highlighted, with the former focusing on collective responsibility and the latter emphasizing individual belief and wealth. The article concludes that the viral image is false and that both Pope Francis and Creflo Dollar have access to lavish luxuries.

450,"### Context: The article debunks the claim that three additives in peanut butter cups, soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ, are inherently dangerous and should be avoided. It explains that the claim is misleading and factually impoverished. 

Regarding soy lecithin, the article states that it is a naturally occurring mixture of organic compounds and is added to foods to improve texture and aid in mixing. The claim that soy lecithin has detrimental effects on fertility, causes behavioral and cerebral abnormalities, and is linked to breast cancer is based on a study that used extremely high doses of soy lecithin on pregnant laboratory rats. The amount of soy lecithin used in the study is much higher than what humans would consume, even on a daily basis. The FDA considers lecithin and lecithin bleached with hydrogen peroxide to be safe for consumption.

Regarding PGPR, the article explains that it is a common additive used to improve texture and volume in bakery products, salad dressings, and chocolate. The claim that PGPR is connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children is a misrepresentation of its risk, which is negligible. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has reaffirmed the safety of PGPR.

Regarding TBHQ, the article acknowledges that it is a petroleum derivative but states that it is a specific, isolated, and modified chemical. While there have been animal studies reporting harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses allowed by regulatory agencies are settled. The EFSA has found that TBHQ is not carcinogenic and further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary. The claim that children exposed to TBHQ may show anxiety, restlessness, and intensified ADHD symptoms is not supported by peer-reviewed studies specifically linking TBHQ to these conditions.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ in peanut butter cups are inherently dangerous. It explains that the claims made about these additives are either misleading or based on unrealistic doses used in studies. Regulatory agencies have deemed these additives safe for consumption.
Claim: Three additives in peanut butter cups, soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ, are inherently dangerous and should be avoided.

451,"### Context: The article states that if someone has a runny nose and sputum, they likely have a common cold rather than Covid-19. However, it also mentions that these symptoms do not rule out the possibility of having Covid-19. It explains that Covid-19 is characterized by a dry cough with no runny nose, but having a runny nose does not completely rule out the presence of the virus.

The claim also mentions that the new coronavirus is not heat-resistant and can be killed by a temperature of 26/27 degrees. The article disputes this claim, stating that there is no evidence to support this. While similar viruses may transmit less effectively in higher temperatures, many countries with reported Covid-19 cases are experiencing temperatures higher than 26/27 degrees.

Regarding the transmission of the virus, the claim states that if someone with the new coronavirus sneezes, the droplets travel about 10 feet before dropping to the ground and no longer being airborne. The article contradicts this claim, stating that the distance droplets can spread from a sneeze depends on environmental factors but is likely to be several meters.

The claim also mentions that the virus can survive on metal surfaces for at least 12 hours, and if someone comes into contact with a metal surface, they should wash their hands with bacterial soap. The article states that the exact survival time of the virus on surfaces is unknown, but it may be between hours and days. It also mentions that there is no evidence yet that the virus can survive in clothing and be transmitted this way, but any soiled clothing should be thoroughly washed.

The claim suggests that drinking warm water is effective for all viruses and advises against drinking liquids with ice. The article disputes this claim, stating that there is no evidence that the temperature of liquids consumed can protect or cure diseases caused by viruses.

Lastly, the claim mentions that the virus can only live on hands for 5-10 minutes and recommends washing hands frequently. The article states that the exact duration the virus can last on the skin is unknown, but regular handwashing is advised. It also mentions gargling with a saltwater solution as a prevention method, but states that there is no evidence to support its effectiveness.

In summary, the article disputes several claims made in the initial claim. It states that having a runny nose does not rule out Covid-19, there is no evidence that the virus is not heat-resistant, droplets from a sneeze can spread several meters, the survival time of the virus on surfaces is unknown, there is no evidence of transmission through clothing, the temperature of liquids consumed does not protect or cure viruses, and the exact duration the virus can last on hands is unknown.

Twitter user Bess Kalb shared a thread describing her father's experiences as an ICU doctor treating COVID-19 patients. Her father claimed that the virus damages the blood and vascular systems, comparing it to ""sticking your finger in an electric socket."" Kalb mentioned cases where patients required multiple blood transfusions due to the virus rapidly destroying their red blood cells. She also mentioned the risk of a ""cytokine storm,"" where the immune system attacks the lungs, causing drowning, and the occurrence of random strokes in young people.

These claims made by Kalb were supported by various sources. An article in The Washington Post reported that doctors had observed blood-clotting complications in COVID-19 patients, leading to an increased risk of strokes and other cardiovascular issues. The article mentioned that doctors were alarmed by the high percentage of patients experiencing these complications. Another article in The New England Journal of Medicine described cases of large-vessel strokes in patients under the age of 50 who tested positive for COVID-19. The article highlighted the unusual nature of these cases and the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms.

The article also mentioned the concept of a ""cytokine storm,"" which is an excessive immune response to the virus. This phenomenon has been linked to severe deterioration and high mortality rates in COVID-19 patients. Medical journals such as The Lancet and The Journal of Infectious Disease have discussed the occurrence and treatment of cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients.

Furthermore, the article addressed the issue of COVID-19 patients dying alone and being buried alone due to restrictions on funerals during the pandemic. This aspect of the virus has been widely reported and has caused distress to both patients and healthcare workers.

Overall, the claims made by Bess Kalb regarding the blood-clotting and hematological complications of COVID-19 are supported by medical reports and news articles. These complications have been described as unusual and alarming, and further research is needed to fully understand their mechanisms.

453,"### Context: The article discusses a bill in the Oregon House that aims to change the way health care providers obtain consent to test patients for HIV. Representative Alissa Keny-Guyer, who supports the bill, gave a speech highlighting the importance of testing and treatment for HIV. She mentioned that a study found that those being treated for HIV were 96 percent less likely to transmit the infection to their partners. However, she also noted that many people still go undiagnosed, and testing rates remain stagnant.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends routine screening for all patients between the ages of 13 and 64, with annual screening for high-risk individuals. High-risk patients include injection-drug users and their partners, individuals who exchange sex for money or drugs, sex partners of HIV-infected persons, and men who have sex with men (MSM) or heterosexual individuals who have had multiple sex partners since their last HIV test. Pregnant women are also encouraged to get screened as part of their routine prenatal tests.

According to the CDC's website, the testing figures for Oregon are slightly lower than what Keny-Guyer reported. Less than 37 percent of Oregonians between the ages of 18 and 64 have been tested for HIV, compared to the national average of 40 percent. In the last year, the figures are even lower, with only 18 percent in Oregon and 21.5 percent nationwide.

The article mentions that the representative used statistics from the previous year (2009) instead of the most recent data (2010). The author contacted an aide in Keny-Guyer's office, who confirmed that the representative used outdated numbers. The article also reached out to two organizations, the Cascade AIDS Project and the Oregon Health Authority, who both confirmed that the figures from the Kaiser State Health Facts database were the most accurate available.

In conclusion, while discussing the bill, Keny-Guyer stated that ""only 41 percent of adults have ever been tested"" for HIV in Oregon. The most recent statewide figure is actually slightly lower at 37 percent, but the representative used a correct statistic that was just a year old. The article does not downgrade its ruling based on this minor discrepancy.

454,"### Context: A new blood test for the early diagnosis of cancer is moving closer to market, according to a recent news release. The test, developed by IMSTAR and the University of Bradford, is said to be able to identify individuals with cancer more than 93% of the time. However, the release does not provide details on what the 93% success rate means in terms of sensitivity or false positive rate. The release also fails to mention the risks associated with cancer screening tests, such as the possibility of being misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed.

The article highlights the need for more information on the limitations of the research. The test has only been run on individuals whose cancer status is already known, and a prospective trial is still needed. It is also unclear whether earlier diagnosis will actually make a difference or potentially cause more harm than good.

The funding for the study is not mentioned in the release, but IMSTAR identifies the University of Bradford as a partner on its website. Additionally, the lead researcher quoted in the release appears to co-own a patent for a similar test from 2010.

The release does mention that the test is different from other universal cancer tests because it does not target a specific biomarker or mutation. However, it does not provide further information on alternative tests.

The release concludes by stating that work to develop the test will continue, but it does not mention the need for a prospective trial. The release does exercise caution by describing the blood test as a ""potential"" tool.

In summary, the news release announces the development of a new blood test for early cancer diagnosis. However, it lacks important information such as cost estimates, the meaning of the 93% success rate, and the risks associated with cancer screening tests. The release also fails to provide details on the limitations of the research and the need for a prospective trial.
Claim: 'Universal' blood test for earlier diagnosis of cancer moves closer to market
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Blood tests have become a popular study focus among scientists seeking mechanisms for early detection of cancer. Researchers have come up with a number of tests in recent years that examine a variety of components of blood, among them types of blood cells, proteins, and the presence of mutated DNA. Most of the tests are specific to particular cancers and vary in their levels of accuracy. In this release, a team at the University of Bradford heralds the increasing accuracy of a test that measures the response of white blood cells exposed to ultraviolet light. The test, called TumorScan, uses an automated cell reader designed by a Paris-based company, IMSTAR, to examine thousands of cells from any one sample, and the researchers say that they have found the process can detect the presence of any type of cancer with more than 90% success. IMSTAR has now licensed the university team’s technology and plans to bring the text to market some time in the future. The release touts the potential benefits without addressing some real concerns: Technology like this is enabling us to find more and more cancers at an earlier stage, but we are often unable to differentiate between the ones that need to be treated and those that can be monitored or ignored. While the news release didn’t need to go into great detail about this, it should at least acknowledge the downsides. Finding cancer at an early stage via a blood test may improve survival rates, and reduce the need for invasive biopsies. However, it’s important to keep in mind that all cancer screening tests carry the risks of false-positives, false-negatives and overdiagnosis and treatment of non-growing or slow-growing cancer.",'Universal' blood test for earlier diagnosis of cancer moves closer to market,"This news release from the International Meso-Stem Cell Institute (IMSTAR) describes a “universal” blood test for the early diagnosis of cancer. The test, which is still in the research phase, is said to be able to detect cancer in a person’s blood by looking for a “pattern of proteins” that is “unique to each individual with cancer.” The release does not mention the cost of the test, which is a major oversight. It also does not mention the risks associated with cancer screening tests, such as the possibility of being misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed. The release also fails to mention that the study only looked at people whose cancer status is already known, and that a prospective trial is still needed. The release also does not mention that the lead researcher appears to co-own a patent for a similar test from 2010.

456,"### Context: A portable device called VIPS has been developed to detect severe strokes with 92% accuracy in a matter of seconds. The device uses a combination of ultrasound and machine learning algorithms to differentiate between severe and minor strokes. The study found that the device had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 92% in distinguishing severe strokes from minor strokes. It also had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 87% in differentiating severe strokes from all other subjects. The device was able to achieve an AUC of 0.95, indicating its high accuracy in stroke detection.

However, the article points out that the study did not measure whether the device offers any benefits beyond the current standard of care or if it improves patient outcomes. It also raises concerns about the potential consequences of false negative test results, which could lead to incorrect or unnecessary treatment. The gold standard in stroke care is a CT scan, which determines if a patient is eligible for clot-busting drugs or endovascular therapy. Therefore, a more appropriate comparison for the VIPS device would be with CT scans, especially since mobile CT scanners are increasingly being used in ambulances.

The article mentions that the device is still in its testing phase and that further research will be conducted to determine if the VIPS device can use machine learning algorithms to discriminate between minor and severe strokes without the help of neurologists. While the device is considered a novel technology, the concept of pre-hospital stroke diagnosis is not new, as CT scanners have been used in ambulances with some success.

The article also highlights the importance of discussing the cost of the device, as well as its sensitivity and specificity, when discussing medical diagnosis. It notes that the news release only mentions the specificity of the test, while the actual study reports both sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the article mentions that the release identifies the funding company and states that consultants were paid to analyze the neuroimaging data independently.

In conclusion, the VIPS device shows promise in detecting severe strokes with high accuracy. However, further research is needed to determine its benefits compared to the current standard of care. The article emphasizes the need for a more appropriate comparison with CT scans and raises concerns about false negative test results.
Claim: Portable device detects severe stroke in seconds with 92 percent accuracy
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"With a suspected stroke, speed matters. If this device described in the release, called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS), could help emergency personnel determine where to take patients with suspected stroke for treatment (a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center) then it might be very valuable. The release describes a published study on the VIPS diagnostic tool showing that it can accurately detect large-vessel occlusion (a blockage or closing of a blood vessel) in patients with suspected stroke yet it misses some of the key features you’d expect with a news release talking about a new diagnostic tool, especially its cost, and its accuracy measured against other methods, such as a mobile CT scan, to differentiate strokes. If care could be improved by a speedier, easy to use device which helps decide whether endovascular therapy (a procedure used to treat problems affecting the blood vessels) is necessary this could well improve outcomes for stroke patients. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Mount Sinai, the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center and elsewhere published a study in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery suggesting that their device (a visor worn by emergency personnel) called a volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) was better at identifying patients with large-vessel occlusions than a standard physical examination. This matters because if the device passes all the other tests we expect of diagnostic tools including showing it’s sufficiently sensitive and specific and an improvement over other methods, then it could more quickly route patients to stroke centers that have endovascular capabilities and have a large impact on the outcome of patients.",Portable device detects severe stroke in seconds with 92 percent accuracy,"This news release describes a portable device that uses ultrasound and machine learning to detect severe strokes.

457,"### Context: A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that nearly 1 percent of pregnancies in a group of 7,870 women and girls aged 15 to 28 were reported as being conceived independently of men. The study, published in the BMJ Christmas edition, analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which followed participants for 14 years. The researchers discovered that 45 women and girls reported becoming pregnant despite claiming to be virgins at the time of conception. The study also found that these self-described virgins were more likely to have signed chastity pledges and had parents who rarely discussed sex and birth control with them. Additionally, they were less knowledgeable about condom use. However, the study did not find any statistically significant similarities between these pregnancies and the Virgin Mary. The researchers concluded that self-reported behavior should be interpreted with caution, as fallible memory, beliefs, and wishes can lead people to provide inaccurate information to scientists. The BMJ Christmas edition also included papers on other unconventional topics, such as whether there is a local baby boom after home sports teams win and whether eating an apple a day can keep the doctor away.

It mentions that PET scans can be expensive, ranging from $1000 to $3500, and may not be covered by insurance. However, the article does not provide the cost of traditional neurologic exams for comparison. The benefits of PET scanning are not quantified in the article, although it mentions that several studies suggest it can effectively provide an early warning for Alzheimer's. The magnitude of effects observed in these studies is not specified.

The article fails to mention that even if Alzheimer's is detected early, there is limited treatment available. Aricept, a medication mentioned in the article, only has minor effects on the progression of the disease. The article briefly mentions false alarms from PET scans but does not provide sufficient information on the harms of scanning. It does not explain what a ""false alarm"" entails or how it affects a person who receives this news.

The strengths of the available evidence for PET scanning are not adequately described in the article. It states that neurologists consider PET to be an excellent tool for distinguishing between Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia. However, experts disagree on whether PET is useful for determining early Alzheimer's in people with mild memory problems. The article notes that there is insufficient research to determine the accuracy of PET scanning but does not explain the nature of the studies conducted.

The article accurately describes the prevalence of Alzheimer's to avoid disease mongering. It quotes two directors of major Alzheimer's research centers but could have included perspectives from other clinicians or researchers.

Claim: Using PET Scans to Discover Early Signs of Alzheimer’s
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Alzheimer’s disease is a common and tragic disease. In spite of much research, there is currently little that can be done to stop or slow its progression. A hot area of research is in early detection. Two years ago, Medicare decided to cover PET scanning for diagnosing Alzheimer’s, with the hope that it could help with treatment and allow patients and their families to help with future planning. However, Medicare’s decision was very controversial and there are many issues surrounding the use of PET scanning for this conditon. This story does little to enlighten readers and is flawed in several ways. The story does not attempt to quantify the benefits of PET scanning. Most importantly, the story does not mention that even if Alzheimer’s is detected early, there is not much that can be done for it.

459,"### Context: The article discusses President Barack Obama's claim that during his time as a student at Occidental College in Los Angeles from 1979 to 1981, there were days where people couldn't go outside due to pollution in the air. The article provides background information on smog in Los Angeles, explaining that it is created when light reacts with motor vehicle and industrial emissions to form ground-level ozone. Smog can cause difficulty in breathing, asthma attacks, lung inflammation, and eye irritation. Los Angeles has been known for its smog due to heavy automobile usage, its industrial base, and geographical features that prevent polluted air from dispersing.

The article states that while Los Angeles still has smog, environmental efforts have significantly reduced the extent of the problem. The last stage 3 smog alert occurred in 1974, and the last stage 2 alert occurred in 1988. The article provides statistical evidence from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which shows that health advisories and stage 1 alerts were issued multiple times during the years Obama attended Occidental College.

The article clarifies that the advisories were aimed at children and individuals with existing health concerns, rather than healthy adults. However, it acknowledges that staying indoors was preferable during smog alerts. The article includes testimonies from individuals who experienced smog alerts during their time as students in Los Angeles, supporting the claim that smog was a severe problem at the time.

In conclusion, the article states that while Obama's claim that ""folks couldn't go outside"" is an oversimplification, he is correct in stating that smog was a significant issue in Los Angeles during his time as a student at Occidental College.

460,"### Context: New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard has expressed concerns about the construction of a border wall along the state's border with Mexico. She delivered her comments to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while Democratic members of New Mexico's congressional delegation pushed for an extension of the public comment period on the plan. The construction of taller barriers along the border has been a contentious issue in the debate over border security and immigration reform in the United States.

In April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued waivers to environmental laws to allow border wall work in New Mexico and Arizona. The state of California and environmental groups attempted to block similar work near San Diego and Calexico, but a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration, stating that it did not exceed its powers by waiving environmental rules to speed up construction.

Under President Donald Trump's plan, the government intends to replace existing waist-high vehicle barriers with metal bollards along 31 miles of the border in Luna County and install 15 miles of taller fencing in Dona Ana County. However, Garcia Richard stated that her agency has not received any inquiries from federal officials regarding permits or easements required to access state trust lands adjacent to the proposed construction areas.

Garcia Richard criticized the Trump administration for being fixated on the idea of a border wall and suggested that the public comment period was merely symbolic, as little information has been released on how the construction will proceed. She argued that the border project does not meet the standards for sustainable land management and that the exact impact on state trust land cannot be determined.

The State Land Office expressed concerns about the proximity of the planned construction to state trust land, as well as the potential for extensive digging, trenching, and truck traffic. They are worried about the impact on air quality, soil, and vegetation. The agency also claimed that there is no publicly available documentation to show that federal officials have engaged in environmental planning, despite Customs and Border Protection agreeing to be responsible for it.

Overall, Garcia Richard and the State Land Office are concerned about the lack of information and potential negative impacts of the border wall construction on state trust land and the environment.

461,"### Context: French foie gras makers are concerned about the spread of bird flu in Europe, as it could lead to higher prices for the delicacy during the Christmas season. Last year, the French government culled all ducks and geese and halted production for four months in an effort to contain the virus. This resulted in a 25% drop in output and cost the industry around 500 million euros. Farmers are hoping that the stricter measures put in place since last year's crisis will better protect their industry if the current outbreak of the H5N8 strain reaches France. However, there are concerns that birds could still contaminate farms despite the precautions taken. Marie-Pierre Pe from the foie gras makers group CIFOG stated that prices could be 10% higher this Christmas due to the previous year's culling and the current outbreak. Foie gras, made from duck or goose liver, is considered a gourmet food in Western and Asian cuisine. It is sold whole or as a pate. The practice of force-feeding the birds has been criticized as cruel by animal activists. CIFOG has been holding regular meetings with farmers to explain the biosecurity measures implemented after last year's crisis, such as protecting food and water from wild birds. Farmers in southwestern France, the top foie gras producing region, are also facing stricter rules to prevent contamination between farms. Several European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Croatia, have reported outbreaks of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu in recent weeks. France has not reported any cases so far, but the country has increased surveillance measures to prevent wild migrating birds from transmitting the virus to farm poultry. Denmark has ordered farmers to keep their poultry indoors, and Germany is considering implementing similar measures.

462,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek that Republican frontrunner Marco Rubio believes that the government should not be involved in the healthcare business at all. Meek's claim is based on a quote from Rubio where he criticizes the Obama healthcare reform plan and refers to it as ""government-run health care."" Meek's campaign argues that this statement indicates Rubio's opposition to all government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

However, the article provides evidence that contradicts Meek's claim. Rubio has written an op-ed expressing concerns about cuts in Medicare and has supported certain health care programs and proposals. He voted in favor of hearing screening for newborns, expanding Kidcare (a health program for poor children), and changes to the Kidcare program. Rubio has also supported Florida's Medicaid reform, which aimed to slow growth in costs by allowing private companies to compete to provide services for the poor.

Furthermore, Rubio has supported Medicaid in the budget and has advocated for the need to save it. He has also supported funding for Jackson Memorial Hospital, a public hospital.

The article concludes that while Rubio has criticized the Obama healthcare reform plan, it does not mean that he is against all government health programs. The evidence provided suggests that Rubio believes government has a role in healthcare and has supported various health programs and proposals.

In summary, the article refutes the claim made by Meek that Rubio believes the government should not be involved in the healthcare business at all. The evidence presented shows that Rubio has supported government health programs and has expressed concerns about cuts in Medicare.

It also does not provide the name or date of the article published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, making it difficult to verify the information. The study is based on data collected for the Framingham Offspring Study, which is an observational study and not a clinical trial.

The article implies that people who are unaware of their LDL particle numbers cannot accurately assess their heart disease risk, potentially causing unnecessary fear and the need for the test. The article quotes William Cromwell, the former chief medical officer of LipoSource, the company that markets the LipoProfile test. Although the article states that Cromwell no longer has a financial interest in the company, his co-author on the published study is an executive with LipoSource, raising questions about the independence of the source.

The article also fails to describe alternative methods of assessing and managing heart disease risk without using the LipoProfile test. It does not provide information on how and under what conditions the test is available. The article suggests that the LipoProfile test is a novel method of identifying hidden heart disease risk using lipid analysis, but there are other tests available and under development that link heart disease risk with different lipid measures.

464,"### Context: The FDA has approved Wyeth's drug, Pristiq, for the treatment of depression. Pristiq is a derivative of Wyeth's Effexor depression drug and was developed in the hopes of gaining approval before Effexor loses its patent protection in 2010. However, some analysts have dismissed Pristiq as a ""me, too"" drug with limited sales potential. Wyeth also tested Pristiq as a treatment for hot flashes in post-menopausal women, but the FDA raised concerns about potential heart and liver problems and requested further studies to verify its safety. Despite skepticism from industry analysts, Wyeth's CEO, Bernard Poussot, remains confident that Pristiq will eventually generate annual sales of $1 billion or more. Analysts suggest that Pristiq may still achieve decent sales, even after cheaper generic forms of Effexor become available, as many patients switch between depression drugs to find relief and Pristiq will be one of the few options available. In late-stage depression trials, a low-dose 50-milligram form of Pristiq was found to be effective and better tolerated than a 100-milligram version that failed to gain approval in 2007. The 100-milligram version caused a high percentage of patients to experience nausea and discontinue the drug. Wyeth fixed the quality-control issues at its manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico and now produces the 50-milligram pill there. The approval of Pristiq is seen as an important option for physicians in treating depression. Wyeth's stock price remained unchanged after the announcement.

465,"### Context: The claim that the FBI foiled a Muslim Brotherhood plot to take over the United States is not supported by credible sources. The claim originated from conspiracy-oriented websites and was accompanied by a YouTube video. These websites are known to regularly post misleading or false stories. Trusted news outlets have not reported on such an FBI raid.

Yusuf al-Qaradwai, a Sunni cleric from Egypt, is mentioned in the claim. He is a controversial figure who has advocated for the integration of Muslims into the modern world. However, he has also issued fatwas that sanction violence and stoke sectarian and religious hatred. In one of his well-known fatwas, he permitted the use of suicide bombing as a defensive tactic against Israel.

The article emphasizes that the claim lacks credibility and is not supported by reliable sources. It highlights the fact that the conspiracy-oriented websites that first posted the story are known for spreading misleading or false information. The FBI has not confirmed or denied ongoing investigations related to the alleged activity.

The mention of Yusuf al-Qaradwai provides some background information about his controversial views and the fatwas he has issued. While he has advocated for the integration of Muslims into the modern world, he has also made statements that promote radicalism and violence.

In conclusion, the claim that the FBI foiled a Muslim Brotherhood plot to take over the United States is not substantiated by credible sources. The story originated from conspiracy-oriented websites known for spreading misleading or false information. The mention of Yusuf al-Qaradwai provides some context about his controversial views and fatwas.

466,"### Context: The claim that the invasion of New Guinea Flatworms in Florida poses a significant risk to human health and sightings should be reported to authorities by calling 911 is not supported by the information in the article. The New Guinea Flatworm, also known as Platydemus manokwari, was first spotted in Florida in 2012 and is now well established in the state. While the flatworm has a negative impact on the ecosystem, there is no need to report sightings to authorities.

The article mentions that the primary danger of the New Guinea Flatworm is to the ecosystem rather than human health. The flatworm has been known to damage native snail populations and other slow-moving soil invertebrates. It may indirectly impact vertebrate species dependent on these soil invertebrates. The article also states that the New Guinea Flatworm does not prey on rats, as claimed in the viral post. It typically eats snails, earthworms, and slow-moving arthropods.

However, the New Guinea Flatworm is a possible carrier of a parasite called rat lungworm, which can cause mild symptoms or a rare type of meningitis in humans. The parasite requires three hosts to complete its life cycle, one of which can be a flatworm or snail. If one were to accidentally consume food that came in contact with the mucus of an infected flatworm or directly consume the animal itself, there is a potential risk of contracting a rat lungworm infection. However, there have been no confirmed cases of the New Guinea Flatworm carrying the rat lungworm in Florida.

To avoid the potential risk, the article advises not handling the flatworms and not putting hands near the eyes or nose before cleaning them carefully. The CDC also recommends not eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs, wearing gloves when handling them, and thoroughly washing fresh produce.

In conclusion, while the New Guinea Flatworm invasion in Florida has negative impacts on the ecosystem and carries a potential risk of rat lungworm infection, there is no need to call 911 to report sightings. The primary danger is to the ecosystem rather than human health.

",false,"What's true: Since as early as August 2012, increasing numbers of the infamously invasive New Guinea Flatworm have appeared in Florida. These animals can theoretically transmit the rat lungworm parasite to humans. What's false: The primary risks posed by the New Guinea flatworm are to the ecosystem it invades and not to human health. As such, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission does not recommend calling 911 to report their sightings. The New Guinea Flatworm does not (and can not) eat rats or mice, despite claims to the contrary.",A recent invasion of New Guinea Flatworms in Florida poses a significant risk to human health and a sighting of this non-native animal should be reported to authorities by calling 911.,"What's true: The New Guinea Flatworm is a non-native species that has been spreading across Florida since 2012 and is a potential carrier of a parasite that can cause meningitis in humans. What's false: The New Guinea Flatworm is not known to prey on rats, and there have been no confirmed cases of the flatworm carrying the parasite in Florida."
467,"### Context: The claim that the flu killed 80,000 people in the U.S. last year is exaggerated. The figure of 80,000 was a preliminary estimate provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the 2017-18 flu season. However, the final figure for that year was lower, estimated to be around 61,000 deaths. The CDC later updated its estimate for the 2017-18 season, noting that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987 deaths.

As for the 2018-19 flu season, the number of deaths is still preliminary and will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available. The current estimate is about 34,157 deaths, which is less than half of what the Facebook post claims.

The CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. They first look at in-hospital deaths and then use death certificate data since not all flu deaths occur in the hospital. The process of tallying flu deaths is challenging because many deaths due to flu may not be coded as such.

The Atlantic explains that if flu deaths were counted in the same way as COVID-19 deaths, the number would be substantially lower. This does not mean that the flu is being overestimated, but rather that COVID-19 deaths may be underestimated.

In conclusion, the claim that the flu killed 80,000 people in the U.S. last year is not accurate. The preliminary estimate for the 2017-18 flu season was around 80,000 deaths, but the final figure was lower at 61,000 deaths. The estimate for the 2018-19 season is about 34,157 deaths, but this number is still preliminary and subject to change.

468,"### Context: The article discusses wrist replacement surgery as a last resort for individuals who want to preserve the range of motion in their hand. It mentions that the cost of treatment and whether it is covered by Medicare or other insurers is not mentioned in the article. The benefits of the surgery are not quantified, and the article only presents the anecdotal experience of one patient with one surgeon.

The article acknowledges one disadvantage of the operation, which is the inability to lift heavy objects. However, it fails to mention potential complications such as infection, which can occur in any joint replacement surgery. A study mentioned in the article states that 52% of patients had complications after wrist replacement, and 44% reported pain one to five years after the surgery.

There is a possibility of undergoing a second operation for fusion if the implant fails, which is a risk that persists with newer implant designs as well as old ones. The article does not provide a source for the projected 10- to 15-year life of the device. It also lacks a discussion of evidence, with limited high-quality literature on wrist replacement available. Some experts consider the procedure experimental.

The article heavily relies on testimonials from one patient who underwent the operation and one doctor who performs about 10 of these operations every year. It does not provide information on potential conflicts of interest or conflicting points of view. Input from experts outside of the institution would provide balance and clarify the risks and benefits of the procedure.

The article briefly mentions alternatives to wrist replacement surgery, such as medications, physical therapy, and fusion, and outlines their advantages and disadvantages. Other surgical treatments for wrist arthritis exist, but the evidence supporting them is also limited.

The article mentions that wrist replacement surgery has been available for decades but does not explain why it is seldom used. It does not provide information on FDA approval or the availability of the operation in different medical centers.

The article notes that newer versions of the implants enable surgeons to retain more of the patient's native bone. It also mentions that two weeks before the article was published, a press release from the Texas Medical Center covered similar information, and the expert source quoted in the article is the same surgeon mentioned in the press release. This raises questions about whether the article relied solely or largely on the press release.

Overall, the article lacks important information regarding the cost, coverage, risks, and benefits of wrist replacement surgery. It heavily relies on testimonials and does not provide a balanced perspective from outside experts.

This article attempts to show how one surgical procedure—the replacement of the wrist joint—fits into the spectrum of treatment choices. It notes that the “seldom-used” operation has been around for decades, and accurately reflects the complexity of the operation. Although the story mentions some of the alternatives to joint replacement (e.g. medications, physical therapy, and fusion)—and briefly sketches their advantages and disadvantages, it does not attempt to evaluate the quality of the evidence to support any of them. The story provides no data on whether the operation is appropriate in some people and not others, no measure or list of potential complications or costs, and no quantification of the procedure's absolute benefit or its relative worth compared to other treatments.

469,"### Context: The article discusses Rudy Giuliani's claim that he reduced abortion rates and increased adoptions by 135 percent during his tenure as mayor of New York City. The article acknowledges that abortions did decline by 16.8 percent during Giuliani's time in office, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it disputes Giuliani's assertion that he played an active role in reducing abortions, as he had previously expressed support for abortion rights and even signed a proclamation for ""Roe vs. Wade Anniversary Day."" The article also questions the link between the rise in adoptions and the decline in abortions, as there is no research to support this claim.

Regarding the increase in adoptions, the article explains that Giuliani's campaign initially claimed a 65 to 70 percent increase in adoptions. However, Giuliani now cites a 135 percent increase, which his staff calculated by comparing adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. The article argues that a more traditional comparison, looking at adoption rates in the first and last year of Giuliani's tenure, shows only a 17 percent increase. The campaign justifies their methodology by stating that it smooths out peaks and valleys caused by various factors. However, the article finds this approach unorthodox and inconsistent with the methodology used for the abortion rate comparison.

In conclusion, the article finds that while Giuliani's claim about the decline in abortion rates is accurate, it is a stretch for him to take credit as an abortion-rights mayor. Additionally, the article argues that Giuliani has inflated the adoption figures by using creative math. The overall claim is deemed ""Barely True.""

470,"### Context: Since June 1, 2018, nearly 300 ringed, bearded, and spotted seals have died in Alaska, and the cause of death is still unknown, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries. The agency is investigating a range of possible causes, including viruses, bacteria, and algal blooms. The water temperature in the northern Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea has been higher than normal in the past two summers, and NOAA is considering possible ecosystem influences, such as diminished sea ice. The deaths occurred across all age groups and mostly between June and September. Some of the stranded seals were missing fur or appeared skinnier than normal, but decomposition has made it difficult to determine the exact fat layer. The number of reported strandings was almost five times higher than the average, with 85 bearded seals, 66 ringed seals, 40 spotted seals, and 91 unidentified seals. Alaska Native coastal communities rely on hunting these seals for subsistence. The deaths are being treated as an unusual mortality event, allowing NOAA to focus resources on the investigation. Bearded seals, ringed seals, and some populations of bearded seals are listed as threatened species due to the loss of sea ice caused by climate warming. In June, the Center for Biological Diversity sued the Department of Commerce and the National Marine Fisheries Service for not designating critical habitat for threatened ringed and bearded seals. This is not the first time an unusual mortality event has occurred among ice seals and walruses in Alaska. From 2011 to 2016, an abnormal molting and death event affected 657 seals, but a definitive cause was not identified. Biologists do not believe this event is connected to the current one.

It also suggests that the entire Clinton family was eliminated and cloned beneath Camp David, and that the current human replicas claiming to be the Clintons have no souls. The article further states that there are multiple clones of Bill and Hillary Clinton that travel with their entourages and are on reserve in case the hero clone fails. It also mentions that there are no known instances of human cloning that could result in a fully-mature adult in three days, and that cloning humans and primates is more difficult than in other mammals due to the location of essential proteins in primate eggs. The article concludes by stating that the idea of clones not having souls is subjective and that the claim of the entire Clinton family being wiped out in 1998 is false, as Bill Clinton was the sitting U.S. President until 2001 and Hillary Clinton has held high-profile political offices since 1998.

474,"### Context: The article discusses a meme that circulated online in February 2016, which criticized Bernie Sanders for his lack of business acumen and experience. The article analyzes the claims made in the meme and provides context to evaluate their accuracy.

The first claim in the meme is that Sanders never owned a business. The article argues that owning a business is not necessarily a relevant qualification for a potential chief executive. It mentions that several highly-regarded U.S. presidents, such as Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, never owned their own businesses. It also points out that Sanders did start and operate his own business, the American People's Historical Society, which produced educational film strips about the history of Vermont.

The second claim in the meme is that Sanders never invented anything. The article states that while Sanders is not an inventor and holds no patents, this fact is not relevant to his qualifications or success as a candidate. It mentions that only one U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln, held a patent.

The third claim in the meme is that Sanders never had a 9 to 5 job. The article argues that this claim is too vaguely worded to analyze properly. It mentions that Sanders held a series of odd jobs before reaching public office, including working as an aide at a psychiatric hospital, a Head Start preschool teacher, a carpenter, and a freelance writer for local publications.

The fourth claim in the meme is that Sanders never proposed a bill that has passed. The article acknowledges that this statement is not literally true, as Sanders has sponsored three bills that were enacted. However, it explains that only a small percentage of bills submitted in Congress are brought to a vote and even fewer end up being enacted. It also highlights that Sanders has co-sponsored over 200 successful bills.

The fifth claim in the meme is that Sanders lived off welfare before being elected to public office. The article acknowledges that Sanders likely received public assistance at some point before achieving public office, but the exact details are difficult to determine. It mentions a newspaper account from 1974 that reported Sanders was collecting unemployment benefits at the time.

The article also addresses the claim that Sanders, at 74 years old, has a personal net worth of $300,000. It explains that determining the precise net worth of candidates is challenging, as reporting exact values is not required. However, it mentions an estimate from 2015 that put Sanders' net worth at around $330,000, making him one of the ""poorest presidential candidates"" running for office in 2016.

Overall, the article concludes that the meme accurately describes the arc of Bernie Sanders' financial life, but it provides context to evaluate the claims made in the meme and their relevance to his qualifications as a candidate.

475,"### Context: Actress Emma Watson recently claimed that violence against women has resulted in more deaths than all the wars and conflicts of the past century combined. Watson made this statement during a conversation with feminist icon Gloria Steinem in London, where she also launched a feminist book club. Watson cited the book ""Sex & World Peace"" and stated that there are now 101.3 men to every 100 women on the planet, meaning that women are no longer half of humanity. She expressed shock at the statistic and emphasized that the devaluation of female life is the greatest security dilemma. 

The author of ""Sex & World Peace,"" Valerie Hudson, explained how she arrived at the statistic. She compared the death tolls of 53 wars, conflicts, and authoritarian regimes, totaling 152.75 million lives, to the number of ""missing women."" This concept, developed by economist Amartya Sen, calculates how many women would be alive if they weren't aborted, neglected, or victims of inequality. Hudson used the UN Population Fund's estimate of 163 million missing women in Asia in 2005, which is 10 million more than the lives lost to 20th-century conflicts. However, other estimates do not show female deaths surpassing the death toll of conflicts in the 20th century. 

While the specific number of casualties in well-known conflicts is reported, estimating deaths in lesser-known conflicts is challenging. Additionally, any estimate of missing women assumes that the skewed sex ratio is a result of discrimination. Despite these difficulties, experts agree that the number of missing females is larger than recent demographic catastrophes. They also note that missing women estimates quantify the impact of gender inequality on current generations. 

Watson's claim is based on the book ""Sex & World Peace"" and the UN figure of 163 million missing women in 2005. However, the number of sex-related deaths typically falls within the range of 100 million to 130 million, while most estimates for deaths due to war in the 20th century are around 200 million. Both numbers are alarmingly high, but it is unclear which is definitively higher.
Claim: More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of the 20th century.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Watson said, ""More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of 20th century."" The claim comes from the book Sex and World Peace by Valerie Hudson, who was citing a UN figure of 163 million missing women in 2005. That’s 10 million more than her estimate of lives lost in all of last century’s strife, 153 million. But this is using a high estimate for the first measure and a low estimate for the second. The number of sex-related deaths, which varies from year to year, typically falls within 100 million to 130 million range. The number of deaths due to war, according to most other estimates, is about 200 million. Both numbers are disturbingly high, but it’s not clear that one is definitively higher than the other.","More lives are lost from violence against women, sex-selective abortion, female infanticide, suicide, egregious maternal mortality, and other sex-linked causes than were lost during all of the wars and civil strife of the 20th century.",Harry Potter star Emma Watson said violence against women has led to more deaths than all the wars and conflicts of the past century.
476,"### Context: The claim states that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis in the United States. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer supported this claim by suggesting that there would likely be increased enforcement of recreational cannabis in the future due to the opioid crisis. However, the article argues that there is no evidence to support this claim and that studies actually suggest that cannabis legalization leads to a reduction in opioid overdoses.

The article highlights that the United States is indeed facing a serious crisis with opioid addiction and overdose. Drug overdose deaths, particularly those involving opioids, have been increasing. Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, have been a driving factor in the increase in opioid overdose deaths. The article also mentions that non-medical prescription drug use has been associated with illicit drug use, including heroin.

However, the article disputes the claim that recreational marijuana policies worsen the opioid crisis. It cites a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, which analyzed data from all states between 1999 and 2010. The study found that states with medical marijuana programs had lower opioid overdose mortality rates compared to states without such programs. The association between medical cannabis laws and lower overdose mortality rates strengthened over time. Although this study predates the legalization of recreational marijuana, it suggests that marijuana reform is associated with a decrease in opioid-related deaths.

Furthermore, the article mentions a comprehensive review released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017. This review found no individual study or credible meta-review linking cannabis use to increased opioid use. While the concept of marijuana as a ""gateway drug"" remains controversial, there is a consensus that the opioid crisis is unrelated to marijuana use and is primarily caused by legal prescription painkillers.

In conclusion, the article argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis. On the contrary, studies suggest that less strict marijuana laws result in fewer opioid deaths. The article challenges the implied connection between recreational cannabis and opioid addiction and highlights the need for evidence-based policies.

477,"### Context: The claim that eleven U.S. states have banned the use of electronic cigarettes inside cars is false. The article states that a website called Associated Media Coverage reported this information, but it is a fake news site known for spreading fabrications. The U.S. Department of Transportation (D.O.T) did not pressure state officials to implement such a ban, and there is no plan for a nationwide ban on electronic cigarettes in vehicles.

The article mentions that the D.O.T website published statistics showing an increase in automobile fatalities related to distracted drivers, with approximately 57% of all fatalities in 2014 and 2015 caused by distracted drivers. The representative from the D.O.T, Colton Husker, claims that drivers are becoming more distracted by the use of electronic cigarettes as they become more popular.

The article also lists the eleven states that supposedly agreed to implement the ban: California, North Carolina, Illinois, Texas, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and New York. It states that these states planned to begin implementing the ban in early November 2016 and expected immediate compliance from residents and motorists. However, this information is also false.

The article includes a list of penalties for non-compliance with the supposed ban, including fines and suspension of driving privileges. The penalties listed are as follows: $100 fine for the first offense, $250 fine for the second offense, $500 fine for the third offense, and $825 fine with a 60-day suspension of the driver's license for the fourth offense.

In conclusion, the claim that eleven U.S. states have banned the use of electronic cigarettes inside cars is false. The information was spread by a fake news site, and there is no plan for a nationwide ban on electronic cigarettes in vehicles.

478,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that a few drops of Visine eye drops taken internally will induce uncontrollable diarrhea. It starts by stating that the desire for revenge is common and many people have thought about getting even with someone who has wronged them. The article mentions a popular revenge tactic involving barmaids and cocktail waitresses using Visine eye drops to cause diarrhea in obnoxious customers. This revenge method is appealing because it seems harmless and can be administered secretly. The mental image of the victim rushing to the toilet is satisfying, especially in a society that views fecal output as shameful.

However, the article warns that spiking a drink with Visine is not a guaranteed way to cause diarrhea and can be dangerous. The active ingredient in Visine eye drops, Tetrahydrozoline HCl 0.05%, can have nasty effects when swallowed, including severe depression of the central nervous system. Swallowing Visine can be life-threatening, as demonstrated by cases of children becoming dangerously lethargic and unresponsive after ingesting small amounts of the eye drops. In one case, a woman was arrested for poisoning her children by putting Visine in their water and juice bottles.

The article emphasizes that there is no documented evidence that Visine eye drops cause sudden onset bouts of severe diarrhea. Instead, the ingestion of Visine can have far more serious consequences, such as central nervous system shutdown. The danger is not limited to children, as there have been cases of adults experiencing severe reactions to swallowing Visine.

The article concludes by warning revenge seekers that attempting to harm others by secretly adding noxious substances to their drinks is considered poisoning, regardless of whether harm actually occurs. It mentions an episode of CSI where a drink spiked with Visine caused a death when it reacted with chocolate the victim had eaten.

In summary, the article debunks the claim that a few drops of Visine eye drops will induce uncontrollable diarrhea. It highlights the dangers of swallowing Visine, including severe depression of the central nervous system. The article also warns that attempting to harm others by secretly adding substances to their drinks is considered poisoning and can have serious legal consequences.

The story mentions that the supplements can be bought for a few dollars and discusses the costs in terms of work days missed and lost productivity due to the common cold. However, the article does not provide specific numbers or evidence in absolute terms. The story also highlights the potential side effects of zinc lozenges, such as bad taste, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, and oral irritation. The article mentions that the review is based on 13 trials with 966 participants, but not all trials were included in each analysis due to different reporting methods. The story notes that people who took zinc preparations had symptoms that lasted about a day shorter than those who took a placebo, based on six of the trials. It also mentions that people taking zinc products had less severe symptoms, based on five of the trials. The article emphasizes the uncertainties and limitations of the review, stating that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness and optimal dosage of zinc supplements. The story also mentions the financial and clinical impact of the common cold. However, the article does not compare zinc to alternative treatments or provide information on how to protect oneself from getting a cold besides using zinc products. The story also mentions the side effects of nasal zinc remedies and the FDA warning against a specific zinc supplement called Zicam. Overall, the article provides a balanced view of the review, highlighting both the potential benefits and limitations of using zinc supplements for the common cold.
Claim: Zinc will help your cold, at least a little
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"It begins well, saying, “A new look at the medical evidence shows zinc supplements may take the edge off the common cold. But not a whole lot.” That’s a more realistic assessment of the evidence than the more enthusiastic beginning to the WebMD story on the same subject. At the same time, this story could have done a better job providing details from the review and quantifying the benefits in a transparent way. We also wish it had brought in some outside perspectives, which could have offered some important insights. But let’s not lose sight of the strong points:  for the second straight day, Reuters Health (and this same reporter) led with caution while others trumpeted findings. Note how the WebMD had an early quote, “This is great news.” And the NY Times’ first sentence said it “may be the next best thing” to a cure. To quote the title of an evidence-based health care column in the Times, “Really?”  Although most of us view the common cold as a mere nuisance, the infection can have serious clinical and economic impact. The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 Million is spent annually in the US for over the counter remedies. Unfortunately, the common cold is also responsible for significant number of prescriptions for antibiotics despite the fact that antibiotics do not work against viral infections. The common cold can also trigger ear infections, sinusitis and worsen lung disease. The Cochrane review of published studies assessing the value of a number of different zinc products as both preventives and for treatment provides a new look at a long standing question; Do zinc salts provide any benefit in the treatment or prevention of the common cold? Stories about such a sought after treatment should take an appropriately critical and cautious look at the evidence.","Zinc will help your cold, at least a little","This story reports on a review of 13 studies that found zinc supplements can help reduce the duration and severity of the common cold. The story does a good job of explaining the uncertainties and limitations of the review. It also does a good job of describing the costs in terms of work days missed and lost productivity due to the common cold. The story would have been stronger if it had compared zinc to alternative treatments and provided more information on how to protect yourself from getting a cold besides using zinc products. The story also could have been improved by providing more numbers and evidence in absolute terms. The story mentions that people who took zinc preparations had symptoms that lasted about a day shorter than those who took a placebo, based on six of the trials. It also mentions that people taking zinc products had less severe symptoms, based on five of the trials. But how many symptoms were reduced? How severe were the symptoms in the first place?"
480,"### Context: The claim that the U.S. State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola is partially true. The order was actually made by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which is technically independent of the State Department but works closely with them. The suits are not an astronomical amount, as USAID has already delivered 100,000 suits to the Ebola-infected regions of Africa. The bid for the additional suits is in line with USAID's ongoing efforts to combat the spread of Ebola and does not necessarily indicate that the federal government is anticipating a rapid spread of the virus. The suits are one-use only and are needed for each health provider, so the quantity is necessary. The information about the suits and USAID's efforts is publicly available through their press releases.

481,"### Context: The coronavirus pandemic has led to a unique Easter Sunday for the world's largest Christian population in the United States. Governors and health authorities have urged residents to avoid large gatherings, resulting in the closure of schools, businesses, and churches. Major religious institutions, including Roman Catholic dioceses and Protestant churches, have found alternative ways to celebrate Easter. For example, the Rock Springs Baptist Church in South Carolina held services in their parking lot, with members watching on outdoor screens and listening to the broadcast on local radio. Other churches have upgraded their video and internet systems to allow for online services. Some retirement communities celebrated Holy Week by playing music and video broadcasts of services, while others held contests for residents to decorate golf carts for Easter. A youth pastor in Texas organized a safe Easter egg hunt for children using the online video game Minecraft. However, some churches have defied social distancing rules and planned to hold in-person services, with pastors predicting divine protection from the disease. Most Catholic dioceses have closed all live services. Archbishop Jose Gomez of the Los Angeles diocese encouraged priests and parishioners to remain steadfast during this challenging time. St. Anne Catholic Church in Georgia filled its pews for Easter Sunday by having members send in ""selfie"" photos of themselves that were taped to the pews. Overall, churches across the United States have had to adapt and find creative ways to celebrate Easter while adhering to social distancing guidelines.

Thunberg has been on the public radar since September 2018 when she started staging climate protests in Sweden. She has been nominated for awards, met with world leaders, and embarked on a highly publicized voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Thunberg's parents, grandfather, and sister are also known. The claim that Thunberg is listed as an ""actress"" on her IMDB page is true, but it should be noted that being an actor does not disqualify someone from having opinions, being an activist, or having a political career. The fact that Thunberg has an IMDB page is often used to insinuate that her environmental beliefs are not sincere, but this is a baseless argument. The website Michael Smith News claimed that Thunberg's IMDB page hinted at her being a paid actress, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The viral video of a young climate protester crying does not feature actress Estelle Renee. The young protester in the video, whose real name is Estella Brasier, does have a profile on a talent website, but there is no evidence that she was paid to appear at the protest or to act concerned about the environment. Brasier's father confirmed that her ideas and concerns expressed in the video were genuine and not paid for. In conclusion, the claim that Greta Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee is false, and there is no evidence to support this claim.

484,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO in a TV ad that Gov. Scott Walker's budget-repair bill would eliminate union representation for thousands of public employees and take away their say in the workplace. The article examines the accuracy of this claim.

The bill does eliminate all bargaining rights for specific categories of public employees, including 30,000 University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff, 5,000 home health care workers, 2,800 employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics, and licensed child care providers. However, the claim that all public employees would lose all bargaining rights is an overreach. The bill would allow collective bargaining only on a base pay rate and raises within the rate of inflation for other public employees, such as schoolteachers and local government workers.

The AFL-CIO ad selectively shortens a news account to make it appear that all collective bargaining rights would be removed for state and local public employees, when in fact the original article added the phrase ""except when it comes to wages."" The ad also fails to mention that firefighters, police, and state trooper unions would not be affected by the bill.

While the immediate consequence of the bill would not result in all public employees losing all bargaining rights, labor experts believe it could be the end result in the future. The bill's provisions, such as capping raises for unionized workers at inflation while nonunion employees are not subject to the same cap, could discourage union membership and render unions irrelevant and powerless.

In conclusion, the AFL-CIO ad accurately highlights the elimination of bargaining rights for specific groups of public employees but overreaches by suggesting that all public employees would lose all bargaining rights and have their unions eliminated. The experts interviewed in the article believe that while the immediate impact may not be as severe, the bill could ultimately lead to the demise of public employee unions in Wisconsin.

It notes that the cost of a DXA scan can range from $45 to $350 or more, and is generally not covered by insurance. However, the article does not provide information on the long-term costs of scanning at suggested intervals. 

The article mentions that DXA scanners can estimate visceral fat, which can help predict the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It also states that the scans can show the amount of fat and lean tissue in each body part, which can be useful for athletes to monitor muscle recovery. However, the article does not quantify the potential benefits of DXA scans in terms of reducing the risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, or speeding up injury recovery.

The article does mention that a study found that 18.5% of women with a normal BMI had excess fat when measured using a DXA scan, making them ""skinny fat."" However, it does not explain the health implications or increased risk associated with being ""skinny fat.""

The article acknowledges that DXA scans involve radiation, but does not provide information on the level of risk associated with the radiation exposure. It compares the radiation dose to chest x-rays and mammograms, but does not clarify whether this means low or high risk.

The article does not provide evidence that using a DXA scan to measure body composition leads to improved outcomes in terms of weight loss, muscle mass, athletic performance, or preventing heart disease. It also does not offer a skeptical perspective on the technology.

The article briefly mentions other techniques for assessing body fat, such as BMI, water weighing, bioimpedance, and skinfold calipers. However, it does not mention whether there are comparative effectiveness studies on long-term outcomes using these different methods.

The article notes that DXA scans are available at a growing number of spas, hospitals, and doctor's offices, but it does not provide specific information on the availability of these scans.

Overall, the article provides some information on the use of DXA scans for measuring body composition, but it lacks quantification of the potential benefits and risks associated with the scans. It also does not provide evidence of improved outcomes compared to other methods of assessing body fat.
Claim: Too Much Fat? Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure gives far more data than a body-mass index
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"A DXA body composition scan featured in the Wall Street Journal. The format of this story — with its hepful “Ache, Claim, Verdict” structure — suggests we are going to be treated to a no-nonsense examination of the evidence supporting dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, for whole body scans to determine an individual’s body composition in terms of fat, bone and muscle. However, the story doesn’t deliver much more than a superficial look at the technology and is lacking in critical perspective. The story concludes that DXA is much more accurate than body mass index (BMI) at calculating someone’s body composition, but doesn’t give readers much information on why this may be important to their health. It focuses on the question of how often one should get scanned, and never challenges the assumption that one needs to get scanned at all. It doesn’t mention that there appears to be no data to show that those who use these scans have any better outcomes than those who do not. We live in a body-conscious society. It’s not clear precisely how much money people in the United States spend on weight loss. U.S. News, for example, reported in 2013 that we spend more than $60 billion a year on weight loss. A year earlier, ABC News pegged it at $20 billion. Regardless of which figure is closer to the mark, the weight loss industry is a juggernaut. And that doesn’t even get into the fitness industry focused on helping us have bigger muscles or more toned bodies. In short, people are extremely interested in losing fat and gaining muscle — and DXA appears to be a tool aimed at, to paraphrase this story, taking the guesswork out of figuring out how well you’re doing. It is, perhaps, inevitable that news outlets will cover this tool and its effectiveness. But these stories should also highlight how and whether they can give people insight into any potential medical problems — or whether it’s primarily a pricey tool for indulging our interest in our own bodies.",Too Much Fat? Try a Whole-Body Scan Procedure gives far more data than a body-mass index,"This story about the use of DXA scans to measure body composition is a bit of a mixed bag. It does a good job of explaining how the scans work and what they measure. It also provides a good description of the availability of the scans.

486,"### Context: The article discusses a program that successfully reduced catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in hospitals. The program aimed to improve caretaker education on when and how to use catheters, as well as reduce the use of catheters overall. The article mentions that catheters in hospitals cause 250,000 infections each year and cost $250 million to treat. However, it does not provide information on the cost of implementing the intervention.

The article highlights the benefits of the program by quantifying the reduction in infection rates. The infection rate dropped from 2.28 to 1.54 infections per 1,000 catheter-days in non-ICU patients, which is a 32% reduction. The use of catheters also decreased from 20.1% to 18.8%, a 1.3% reduction. The article does not discuss any harms associated with the program, but suggests that improved caretaker education does not seem to warrant any significant risks.

The article criticizes the lack of information on the study's strengths and weaknesses. It mentions that the number of participants and the absence of a control group were not provided, which are important limitations in research on quality improvement. The article also points out that the lead author of the study is a paid advisory board member for health services companies, which could be seen as a potential conflict of interest.

The article discusses the alternative to the program, which is the status quo. It mentions that the procedure is already in use at 600 hospitals across 32 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico. It clarifies that any hospital can implement the safety bundle now that the methods are widely published. The article suggests that the scale and duration of the study make it novel and worth covering.

The article includes original quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the study, and also quotes an editorial from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The NEJM editorial provides additional views on the study and its limitations, such as the lack of effect on ICUs where reducing UTIs could have a significant impact on saving lives and reducing suffering. However, the article does not mention that Dr. Saint is a paid advisory board member for health services companies, which could be seen as a potential bias.

Overall, the article provides information on the success of a program in reducing catheter-associated urinary tract infections in hospitals. It highlights the benefits of the program but also criticizes the lack of information on costs, study limitations, and potential conflicts of interest.
Claim: Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"HealthDay highlights a national effort to help reduce an uncomfortable and costly problem: hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), and specifically those caused by indwelling catheters. These devices are tubes that snake up the urethra into a person’s bladder, are anchored there with an inflatable balloon, and continuously drain a patient’s urine. HealthDay nicely captures the scope of the problem, noting that one in five hospital patients are catheterized, and that, of these, 20% are bound to get a UTI. Looking at a typical year, this adds up to about 250,000 hospital-acquired UTIs and roughly $250 million in healthcare costs. The story included quotes from Dr. Sanjay Saint, the lead author of the new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The story breaks down his team’s effort to attack catheter-caused UTIs with a program called “Stop CAUTI,” which is a government-sponsored training toolkit to not only reduce indwelling catheterization rates, but also help caretakers use better technique when they have to insert the devices. The results, as HealthDay explains them? It’s not clear; we’re not given many quantified benefits or study details, and the results that are included happen to conflict with each other. Also missing was a discussion around limitations of the research. Indwelling catheters are very common sights at hospitals, since nurses can insert them once and they rarely slip out (a balloon at the end holds them in place). However, about 75% of UTIs are caused by such catheters, according to the CDC, and more than two-thirds of those infections are thought to be avoidable — both through better caretaker training and by avoiding the use of indwelling catheters. Given the suffering and cost, any program that could decrease the rate of such infections, especially one without any new medical devices — just training sessions and use of alternative, short-term catheterization — would be welcomed by patients, hospitals, insurance companies, and taxpayers alike.",Program Cut Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections,"This is a story about a study that looked at the impact of a program to reduce the use of catheters in patients in non-intensive care units. The study found that the program was successful in reducing the use of catheters and the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The story does a good job of describing the benefits of the program. However, the story should have mentioned that the lead author of the study is a paid advisory board member for health services companies. This could be a potential conflict of interest. The story also should have mentioned that the study did not have a control group and that the number of participants was not provided. These are important limitations in research on quality improvement.

487,"### Context: The article discusses the use of a toxic dye, FD&C Red #4 (also known as Scarlet GN), in the production of maraschino cherries. The dye was banned as a food additive in 1960 but is still added to maraschino cherries because they are classified as decorations rather than food. The US government considers maraschino cherries to be decorations, not food, which allows them to continue to be manufactured with the banned dye. In the 1920s, during the prohibition of alcohol in the United States, companies began soaking the cherries in a brine solution instead of alcohol. Chemicals and coloring, including Red #4, were added until it was banned in 1960. However, in 1965, it was allowed to be added to the cherries again because they were re-classified as decorations. Some maraschino cherries also contain Red #40, which contains benzidene, a cancer-causing agent. The federal standards defining maraschino cherries shifted in the post-Prohibition era. In 1912, the U.S. Department of Agriculture defined maraschino cherries as cherries preserved in maraschino liqueur. However, by 1940, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revised the definition to include any red-dyed cherries impregnated with sugar and flavored with oil of bitter almonds. The FDA initially banned the use of Red No. 4 as a color additive in food but allowed its use in maraschino cherries beginning in the mid-1960s. However, the FDA banned that coloring again in 1976, and it is now only allowed in externally applied drugs and cosmetics. The FDA requires maraschino cherries to include a declaration of the presence of artificial coloring on their labels. Most maraschino cherries sold in the U.S. are now manufactured with Red No. 40, a coloring additive that is FDA-approved for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics. Natural Red No. 4, made from crushed insects, is still widely used in the U.S. as a coloring additive in food products. Overall, the article highlights the use of toxic dyes in maraschino cherries and the regulatory classification that allows their continued use.

489,"### Context: An outside panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has voted in favor of a treatment for children with peanut allergies. The treatment, developed by Aimmune Therapeutics, involves daily capsules of peanut powder that gradually help children build up a tolerance. The nonbinding vote from the panel amounts to an endorsement for approval, and the FDA is expected to make its final decision by January.

The panelists stated that the medication is an important option for parents and children dealing with peanut allergies. However, some panelists expressed concerns because the pill has to be taken continuously to maintain its effect. If approved, an estimated 1.6 million children and teenagers in the U.S. would be eligible for the medication, which is intended for ages 4 to 17.

Peanut allergy is the most common food allergy in the country, and the standard treatment involves strictly monitoring what children eat. However, accidental exposure is common, leading to 1 in 4 children with peanut allergies ending up in the emergency room every year.

Parents at the meeting urged approval of the drug, describing the anxiety of watching their children's diet and daily routine, and even avoiding public places and transportation due to possible peanut residues. They emphasized the peace of mind that the treatment brings.

In a study, after one year, about 66% of participants who took the pills could tolerate the equivalent of three to four peanuts, compared to just 4% of patients who received a placebo. However, the treatment also came with risks, as more than 9% of patients reported severe allergic reactions, and 11% dropped out of the study due to side effects.

Dr. John Kelso, who voted against the treatment, stated that the effectiveness of the treatment has not been demonstrated. Aimmune Therapeutics has not disclosed the exact price of the treatment, but it is expected to cost between $5,000 to $10,000 for the first six months and $300 to $400 per month after that.

Aimmune Therapeutics is also working on treatments for other common food allergies, including eggs. The company does not currently have any products on the market.

The treatment, known as AR101, aims to desensitize people with peanut allergies by gradually exposing them to small doses of peanuts over time. The study found that two-thirds of participants who underwent months of treatment were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts at the end of the study. The control group, on the other hand, had a higher percentage of subjects requiring rescue epinephrine during the final peanut challenge test. The article mentions that one patient experienced stomach cramps, vomiting, and an anaphylactic reaction during the study. It also notes that 11% of participants dropped out of the study due to side effects. However, the article fails to mention the higher dropout rate among those who received the treatment and the unknown long-term effects. The article highlights the limitations of the treatment, stating that not all treated individuals were protected and that allergic reactions were still present. It emphasizes that peanut allergy is a potentially life-threatening condition and mentions that peanut and tree nut allergies affect an estimated 3 million Americans or more. The article includes expert sources, including a doctor who was not involved in the study and is not funded by potential treatment-makers. It also mentions that there is currently no approved treatment for peanut allergy and that the profiled patient had to eat her school lunch at a peanut-free table, highlighting the current practice of avoiding exposure. However, the article fails to mention that AR101 is one of several peanut immunotherapy products potentially entering the market. It does clarify that the treatment is not yet FDA-approved and not commercially available. The article also fails to explain that immunotherapy is an old idea in the treatment of allergies. Overall, the article provides some important information about the experimental treatment for peanut allergy but leaves out certain details such as the higher dropout rate and the existence of other peanut immunotherapy products.

The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This CNN News story describes a new treatment for kids with peanut allergy called AR101, which could help protect against severe reactions to small amounts of peanut ingestion. It’s one of two stories we reviewed about this important and newsworthy study. The other is from Fox News. This report is appropriately cautious, emphasizing that the treatment is not a cure but reduces the threat from accidental exposure. In addition, the story details the commitment that treatment requires and the side effects that can occur. However, it could have done a better job by addressing the cost of this drug and giving the dropout rate of those on the treatment. Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies. It typically presents early in life, is known for severe reactions, and is rarely outgrown. There currently are no treatments for peanut allergy, besides emergency care in the event of a reaction. So a treatment with the potential to make reactions from accidental exposures less severe is certainly of interest.","Experimental treatment helps 2 out of 3 peanut allergy sufferers, study finds","This is a story about a small, preliminary study of an experimental treatment for peanut allergy. The story does a good job of describing the study and its limitations. It also does a good job of describing the potential harms of the treatment.

491,"### Context: U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a doctor and Republican, is calling for the removal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a provision of the health care overhaul. Gingrey claims that the IPAB allows ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" to decide whether patients receive care, such as dialysis or cancer chemotherapy. However, health care policy experts disagree with Gingrey's claim. The IPAB was created to address the growing costs of Medicare and make policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost, not individual patient care. The IPAB is explicitly forbidden from rationing care and raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries. It also cannot change eligibility for Medicare, restrict benefits, or make recommendations that would raise revenue. The IPAB can reduce payments to health care providers, recommend innovations to cut wasteful spending, and reduce payments to hospitals with high rates of readmissions. While some argue that reducing reimbursements for chemotherapy could indirectly lead to rationing, Gingrey's claim that bureaucrats have the power to deny treatment and cause patients to die is incorrect and exaggerated. The IPAB does not have the power to raise costs for Medicare recipients or deny lifesaving care. The claim is deemed outrageous and inaccurate.

Symptoms can take two to four weeks to appear after infection. The disease spreads through skin-to-skin contact or contact with mite-covered items. Treatment involves using medicated skin cream or lotion followed by a hot bath. Lisa Downing, the hospital's director of Infection Prevention and Employee Health, stated that the outbreak was discovered after numerous people reported similar symptoms. The hospital has removed employees with active cases, keeping them out of the facility for 24 hours after treatment. Downing did not disclose the number of infected employees but mentioned that a department in the hospital experienced staffing issues for a period of time. However, she assured that there was no lack of staff or qualified personnel to care for patients. The hospital has implemented its procedures and protocols for infectious outbreaks, and Downing expressed confidence in the staff's ability to follow these protocols. She also emphasized that this was the first time such an outbreak had occurred and that everyone would be hyper vigilant going forward.

494,"### Context: The article discusses a study that compares low dose and high dose radiation for the treatment of HPV-positive oropharynx cancers. The study found that patients treated with reduced radiation had less difficulty swallowing solids and impaired nutrition compared to those treated with standard doses of radiation. However, the article criticizes the release for not providing enough context on the rehabilitation costs associated with the severe lifelong swallowing side effects that are mitigated by the reduction in dose. The release also does not quantify the reduction in progression-free survival or ""cure"" rate with reduced radiation. It does not specify what is meant by ""reduced radiation"" and does not address potential harms in reducing a therapy aimed at a cure. The article also points out that the release does not mention that this is a stage 2 study with a small number of patients (80) and that further validation in a larger comparative trial is needed. The release fails to mention the funding source or the presence of conflicts for researchers. The article notes that the release summarizes a study that includes chemotherapy as part of the treatment regimen and that all patient volunteers were candidates for surgery. The issue of availability of reduced dosages does not apply in this case. The release does not claim novelty, but a related news release on low dose radiation research in HPV-positive head and neck cancers was issued by a partnering institution in 2014. The article criticizes the frequent use of the term ""cure"" in the release, as it does not provide specifics on treatment outcomes and does not establish whether patients were truly cured or not.
Claim: Reducing Radiation Successfully Treats HPV-Positive Oropharynx Cancers and Minimizes Side Effects
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"In a small study of 80 patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cancers of the tonsils and throat, researchers found they could reduce side effects of radiation by reducing the radiation dose. These patients often suffer from lifelong swallowing and eating issues following radiotherapy. The short release did not provide much context. We weren’t provided any numbers for the rate of “cure” in standard doses versus the lower doses under study. The repeated use of the word “cure” in the text seems unjustified since these types of cancers do recur. The word may mean different things to doctors and patients and we discourage its use in medical communications. See our toolkit piece on  7 Words (and more) You Shouldn’t Use in Medical News. There has been an increase in HPV-associated cancers of the head and neck. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are about 16,000 new cases diagnosed per year in the United States. Reducing treatment side effects is important for patients and families. But we don’t find this release gives us enough information to judge whether the reduced radiation therapy doses are just as effective as higher doses.",Reducing Radiation Successfully Treats HPV-Positive Oropharynx Cancers and Minimizes Side Effects,"This news release from the University of Maryland Medical Center describes a study that compared two radiation doses for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. The study found that patients treated with reduced radiation had fewer swallowing problems and better nutrition than those treated with standard radiation doses. The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings. However, it doesn’t address costs, which are significant for this treatment. It also doesn’t quantify the reduction in progression-free survival or “cure” rate with reduced radiation. The release also doesn’t address potential harms in reducing a therapy aimed at a cure. The release also uses the word “cure” without providing specifics on treatment outcomes. The release also doesn’t address availability of reduced dosages.

The drug, known as Tussionex Pennkinetic  Extended-Release Suspension, is approved only for adults and  children age six and older. The prescribing information for doctors specifically says  it should not be used in children younger than 6. Miller said  the company felt that information should be strengthened and  proposed new language to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We recently proactively reached out to the FDA to update  the Tussionex label,” Miller said. The drug is “safe and effective when used as directed,” he  added. Tussionex is one of eight prescription cough medicines that  contain the narcotic pain reliever hydrocodone, Miller said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the FDA  planned to issue an alert about Tussionex after numerous  reports of adverse events including some deaths. The Journal  said the FDA had received reports of patients taking higher  doses or more frequent doses than recommended. FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the agency officials were  “aware of these safety concerns and are working to address  them.”    “We plan to communicate our recommendations to the public  as soon as possible,” she said.

496,"### Context: The article titled ""Worried About Dementia? You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure"" discusses the potential link between high blood pressure and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia. The article implies that medication is frequently used to treat high blood pressure, but does not mention any specific brand names. It suggests that the cost of treatment could be a factor in why many people do not seek treatment for high blood pressure, but does not provide any data or evidence to support this claim.

The article mentions that there is a ""greatly magnified"" and increased risk of AD or vascular dementia among those with untreated high blood pressure, but does not provide solid data or evidence to support this claim. It also does not explain how treating blood pressure reduces this risk or to what extent. The article does not cover the side effects of blood pressure medications, but it does note that these medications are prescription-only and may require medical management due to potential side effects.

The article is based on comments from the director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, but does not provide information about the nature or quality of the evidence on which the advice is based. It also does not acknowledge that the causes of AD and other dementias are still not fully understood. The article strongly suggests that people should take blood pressure medication to lower their risk of dementia, but the evidence presented is not strong enough to support this claim.

The article mentions that at least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients, but does not provide links to these studies. It also notes that the threshold for blood pressure treatment is under debate, with some suggesting that blood pressure should be even lower than 130/80. The article suggests that new suggestions like blood pressure control lowering dementia risk may drive more people to seek treatment without a full understanding of the potential benefits and harms.

The article indirectly discusses alternatives to medication, such as exercise and diet, but does not provide detailed information on these alternatives. It mentions that blood pressure medications and lifestyle changes are readily available. The article also notes that the news ""hook"" is new research to be presented at the Alzheimer's Association meeting, but questions why the story was not delayed until the meeting to provide more substantial information. The Alzheimer's Association website does not have a news release specifically addressing the content of this story.

For many, many reasons, diagnosing and treating high blood pressure are good ideas for maintaining health and preventing strokes and heart disease, and the better news is that there are dozens of drugs and lifestyle changes available — some of them very inexpensive — to help people do so. But this story doesn’t explain that the evidence for an association between high blood pressure and vascular dementia, much less Alzheimer’s disease, is so far mostly observational. And perhaps more significantly, the story carries no data at all to support even the claims or strengths/weaknesses of the association. This NPR story missed an opportunity to offer the data and help the public understand more about risk assessment and probabilities of disease related to blood pressure. And it may mislead people into thinking that if they pop a pressure pill each day, they will avoid Alzheimer’s Disease. That’s unproven.",Worried About Dementia?

497,"### Context: During a Democratic debate in Iowa, Bernie Sanders claimed that 500,000 American veterans have returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injuries. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans from these conflicts have PTSD in a given year. This translates to a range of 297,000 to 540,000 veterans with PTSD. A U.S. Senate resolution also identifies ""more than 390,000"" cases of PTSD among veterans of these conflicts. However, these figures only account for PTSD and not traumatic brain injuries.

A 2013 Congressional Research Service paper found that almost 57,000 veterans from these conflicts were evaluated or treated for a condition possibly related to traumatic brain injury (TBI) by the VA. However, it is unclear if all of these veterans received a TBI diagnosis, and it does not include veterans who experienced a TBI but did not receive care through the VA. The VA estimates that brain injuries account for 22 percent of all combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department identifies 333,169 instances of traumatic brain injury among service members between 2000 and 2015, but this includes all U.S. forces and not just those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. It is also important to note that the majority of these cases are concussions and ""mild TBI"" that last less than 24 hours.

While there are no firm numbers for the exact number of veterans with PTSD and traumatic brain injuries, Sanders' claim of 500,000 falls within the range of estimates provided by the VA and other sources. However, it is important to consider the caveats and limitations of these estimates.

498,"### Context: The article discusses the 25th Amendment to the Constitution and whether it applies to President Donald Trump's behavior and mental state. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, stated that the amendment does not apply to present circumstances, as it was primarily intended for physical incapacitation, serious mental illness, or an inability to function in office. The 25th Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1967, addresses issues of presidential and vice presidential power, including a succession plan and the ability for the president to declare themselves unable to fulfill their duties. The fourth section of the amendment allows someone other than the president to declare presidential disability, which would elevate the vice president to acting president. The president can restore their powers, but if the body that initially transferred power disagrees, Congress can vote to permanently strip the president of their powers. The push for a blueprint for handling presidential disability gained traction after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. The amendment's principal author, Sen. Birch Bayh, and Rep. Richard Poff, another important architect, both believed that presidential inability could encompass physical and mental inability. The drafters intentionally used vague language to allow for flexibility, but the record shows that section four was not intended as a means of removing an unpopular president. Legal experts agree with Schiff's claim that the authors primarily had physical incapacitation, serious mental illness, and an inability to function in mind when drafting the amendment. Overall, the article supports Schiff's statement and rates it as accurate.

499,"### Context: The article discusses the benefits and risks of bisphosphonate use for treating osteoporosis. It mentions that bisphosphonates are available in generic form for as little as $5 a month. However, it also mentions newer osteoporosis drugs that retail for hundreds of dollars or more a month, without providing further information about these drugs. The article states that an analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that bisphosphonates prevented 100 fractures and caused at most 1 for every 1,000 women with osteoporosis treated up to five years. However, it also notes that some critics say the analysis overestimates the benefits and underestimates the number of sudden thigh-bone fractures. The article discusses potential side effects of bisphosphonates, such as sudden fracture of the femur and osteonecrosis of the jaw, but does not mention less serious side effects like heartburn or gastrointestinal problems. It criticizes the article for not providing insight into where the benefits numbers came from and not including discussion of who is leveling criticism against those numbers. The article praises the inclusion of a quote from an expert explaining that osteopenia is not a disease and helps readers understand the term better. It also mentions that the story incorporates input from several sources and discloses their financial ties to relevant drug companies. The article discusses dietary and lifestyle choices that can affect osteoporosis risk but criticizes the lack of information about other osteoporosis drugs and their trade-offs. It concludes that the article provides tools for readers to select the drug and look at reasonable pricing. The article states that the story focuses on an active debate rather than a new technique, technology, or drug, and it goes beyond what would be found in a news release.
Claim: More support for osteoporosis drugs
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This thorough, well-researched story focuses on the debate over how and whether bisphosphonates should be used to treat osteoporosis, and provides a general overview of the related risks and potential benefits. The story does many things well — and addresses cost, potential conflicts of interest, and disease mongering particularly well. However, the story cites benefit numbers from a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper without giving readers any information about the study or where those numbers came from. Providing more context on those benefit numbers would have made the story stronger. Osteoporosis is not uncommon. Estimates of osteoporosis occurrence (and severity) vary, but a 2014 study estimated that more than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of bone injuries, such as hip fractures, that can have significant impacts on a patient’s health and quality of life. A 2007 study estimated that 65 percent of women who develop osteoporosis, and 42 percent of men who develop osteoporosis, will suffer a bone fracture in their lifetime. In short, many people will have to make decisions about how to prevent or treat osteoporosis. If there are complicated issues surrounding widely-used treatment options — as is the case with bisphosphonates — there is real value in news stories that attempt to untangle those issues for readers. That also makes it particularly important for such stories to clearly address everything from the financial ties of expert sources to the quality of the evidence tied to health risks and benefits.",More support for osteoporosis drugs,"This is a story about the benefits and risks of a class of drugs known as bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis. The story does a good job of explaining the potential harms of the drugs, and it provides a good overview of the benefits. The story would have been stronger if it had provided more insight into where the benefits numbers came from, and if it had included a discussion of who is leveling criticism against those numbers. The story also could have been improved by including a discussion of the less serious side effects of the drugs, such as heartburn or gastrointestinal problems.

500,"### Context: The claim that children with COVID-19 will be taken to the hospital alone without their parents is entirely untrue. Hospitals require parental consent to treat minors, as minors cannot legally consent to treatment. In New York hospitals, where the virus is spreading rapidly, temporary visitor policies have been introduced by the New York State Department of Health. However, children are still allowed to have one guardian accompany them. The CDC recommends that children with COVID-19 symptoms should not be taken to the hospital unless they develop emergency warning signs. The CDC has published guidelines for treating adults and children with COVID-19 symptoms at home. Children are not considered a high-risk group for COVID-19, and those who have been confirmed to have the virus generally present with mild symptoms. In the unlikely event that a child is hospitalized for complications from COVID-19, they will have a parent or another guardian by their side.

501,"### Context: The article discusses a new gastric balloon pill called Eprise that helps patients lose weight without surgery or endoscopy. The release does not mention the cost of the procedure, but it could be more or less expensive than other gastric balloons on the market. The pill is less invasive than surgery and is available to those with a BMI of 27 and above. However, it is not a permanent weight-loss solution.

The release provides vague information about the benefits of the pill. It states that 34 patients took part in a study and lost an average of 22 pounds or 37 percent of their excess weight. However, important details such as whether all patients lost weight, the average starting weight, and the age range are not provided. The release also mentions improvements in triglycerides and hemoglobin A1c levels, but does not specify what these improvements are.

The release briefly mentions the potential harms of the pill, including nausea and vomiting. However, there are concerns about irritation in the esophagus or stomach, infection, and improper deflating of the balloon, which could lead to serious complications.

The release does not provide a link to a published abstract or study results, making it difficult to compare the study methodology with the information presented. It is clear that the interim report from the study provides limited evidence of the device's effectiveness, but the release does not provide sufficient cautionary statements.

The manufacturer of the pill is studying what they claim to be the first procedureless gastric balloon. One of the study co-authors holds an equity position in the manufacturer, which means he has an ownership interest in the company and will profit if the device is approved.

The release mentions alternative therapies such as traditional gastric balloon surgery, other newly approved gastric balloon devices, bariatric surgery, weight-loss drugs, and diet and exercise. However, it does not offer data on how the gastric balloon pill compares to these alternatives.

The release clarifies that the device is not yet commercially available. The manufacturer claims to be the first to deliver a gastric balloon via capsule. However, with only 34 patients and unpublished results, the study is too small to make claims about the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Claim: Gastric Balloon in a Pill Helps Patients Lose Weight Without Surgery or Endoscopy
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This release describes a new type of gastric balloon being developed that is inserted via a pill rather than through endoscopy. The interim study on the device was presented at an obesity medical conference and has not been peer-reviewed. The approach appears to be novel; a capsule containing a collapsed balloon is swallowed, then filled with water via a small attached catheter that remains outside the patient’s mouth. After four months, a valve on the balloon opens and the balloon deflates and is excreted by the body. The small patient group (34 volunteers) in the study lost an average of 22 pounds after four months. The device’s main advantage is that it is non-invasive (except for a small catheter which some could find uncomfortable) but the release is based on data that has not been peer-reviewed or published. The release played down the limited evidence base and possible harms and neglected costs. Obesity appears to be a problem that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says America, at least, appears stuck in unhealthy lifestyle paterns. One-in-three Americans is obese. Obesity is a leading contributor to dozens of other health conditions. As a result, millions of people turn to  gastric bypass, and the less intrusive (and less effective) gastric balloon and other medical procedures to try to lose weight when other methods fail. It seems the more effective the procedure is in taking off the weight, the more complications arise. The Eprise gastric balloon pill described in the release claims to be as effective but less intrusive as current methods. If it proves effective, it could be a welcome addition to the weight-loss arsenal.",Gastric Balloon in a Pill Helps Patients Lose Weight Without Surgery or Endoscopy,"This news release describes a study of a new device that is designed to help people lose weight without surgery. The device is a gastric balloon that is swallowed in pill form. The release provides some information about the device and the study, but it is lacking in some important details. For example, the release does not provide any quantification of the benefits of the device, nor does it provide any data on the harms of the device. The release also does not provide any information on the cost of the device, which is a major omission. The release does a good job of describing the alternative therapies to the gastric balloon pill, but it does not provide any data on how the pill compares to these alternatives. The release also does not provide a link to the published abstract or study results, which would have been helpful.

503,"### Context: The claim states that a notorious pedophile was killed by a mother who blew his head off with a shotgun when he tried to rape her 12-year-old child. However, the article clarifies that the claim is not entirely accurate. The incident did occur, but the details have been sensationalized and misrepresented.

According to the article, a woman from Blakely, Georgia, discovered a convicted sex offender named Michael Lindsey hiding in a closet in her home. She called 911 to report the assault and stated that she had fought off the intruder with a spoon. The woman's 12-year-old daughter was also present during the incident. Deputies arrived at the scene and ensured the safety of the victims, who had locked themselves in a room. Lindsey was found outside the home and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death was not a shotgun blast to the head, as claimed, but rather the details remain unclear.

The article also highlights that the source of the claim, Neon Nettle, is a notorious fake news blog known for publishing sensationalized and fabricated stories about pedophiles. In this case, they added false elements to enhance the luridness of the report. The weapon used by the mother was a handgun, not a shotgun, and Lindsey did not have any gunshot wounds above his torso. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that Lindsey was attempting to rape the 12-year-old child. The motive for the burglary remains unknown.

The article concludes by stating that Lindsey, although a sex offender, would not be accurately described as a ""notorious pedophile."" He had only one related conviction from almost twenty years prior to the incident.

In summary, the claim that a mother blew the head off a notorious pedophile with a shotgun when he tried to rape her 12-year-old child is exaggerated and misleading. While the incident did occur, the details have been sensationalized, and the source of the claim is known for publishing fake news. The weapon used was a handgun, and there is no evidence to support the claim of attempted rape.

504,"### Context: The article discusses a news release about the development of a wearable medical device for type 2 diabetes. The news release does not mention the potential cost of the device, but the article suggests comparing it to similar electronic belts sold at Walmart, which range in price from $21.25 to $149. The release provides quantification of the benefits of the device, such as reductions in visceral fat area and HbA1c levels, but does not explain the relationship between these improvements and heat shock protein. The release also lacks information about potential harms, the specifics of the electrical stimulus and heat shock delivery, and whether the device is battery operated or plug-in. The study methods and results are described, but the release could have included a discussion of study limitations. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and how the device compares to existing treatments in terms of outcomes are not addressed. The release mentions that the study was funded by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development and acknowledges that the belt device was provided by Tsuchiya Rubber Co., Ltd. The device is said to have similar effects to exercise therapy and could be an add-on to conventional diabetic medical care, but there is no indication of when it might become available to patients. Heat shock protein is mentioned as an important factor in type 2 diabetes, and the researchers have advanced from theoretical thinking to animal and human trials. Overall, the news release does not use sensational language.
Claim: Development of a wearable medical device for type 2 diabetes
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This release describes research published in Nature Scientific Reports involving mild electric stimulation (MES) and heat shock via a belt-type medical device to promote visceral fat loss and improve blood glucose in patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The research highlighted is the next chapter in what has been a multi-year effort on the part of the investigators to develop a new approach to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The researchers’ previous work in animals and now in a small cohort of people with Type 2 diabetes is not well represented in the release. There’s no clear discussion of how the device works. [Editor’s note: This review was revised to reflect that a funding source was included, but in an easily overlooked sidebar on its EurekAlert! entry. We encourage news release authors to include funders in the text of the release as well so that when the release is picked up and republished, the funding information is included.] Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and in the developed world. Present treatments include lifestyle changes, drugs and for those with morbid obesity, surgery.

While GZA is not formally educated in the sciences, he is a well-informed physics enthusiast and autodidact. In 2011, GZA appeared as a guest lecturer at Harvard and spoke primarily about his work and interests, including physics. He also visited MIT in 2015 to discuss hip-hop and science. GZA's passion for science is evident in his lyrics and his interest in quantum physics, which inspired his album ""Dark Matter."" He has worked with scientists to develop initiatives promoting scientific literacy, particularly among African-American and Latino students. GZA believes that hip-hop can be used as a tool to engage students in science education. While the claim may overstate GZA's credentials as a scientist, it accurately reflects his passion for science and his efforts to promote scientific literacy.

506,"### Context: The article titled ""Hard questions about chemo"" discusses the increased cost of second or third-line chemotherapy drugs for advanced cancer and the impact it has on patients. The article highlights that patients often have to choose between these treatments and their financial savings. It suggests that cost should be considered as an additional side effect of treatment.

The article mentions that it costs a billion dollars to bring a drug to market, according to an American Cancer Society representative. However, it does not provide information on the typical profit made from these drugs once they are available to patients. The article also mentions a book called ""The $800 Million Pill"" that questions the claim of high drug research and development costs.

The article focuses on the burden of cost and how oncologists have started considering it as another downside or side effect of chemotherapy regimens. It notes that guidelines have been developed for discussing and planning the cost of treatment with patients. The article provides price estimates for certain chemotherapy drugs but does not explain how these drugs treat cancer or extend a patient's life.

The article includes perspectives from families, patients, and oncologists who discuss weighing the benefits of newer chemotherapy drugs with the increased cost. It mentions that some drugs have fewer or different side effects. However, it does not discuss the specific benefits of these drugs in terms of how much they add to patients' lives or if they are better than older drugs for treating cancer.

The article also mentions alternative older drugs that may be an option for cancer treatment, noting that the tradeoff may be the type of side effects. It provides resources for patients who may qualify for free or reduced-cost medicines. The article explains that the cost of newer chemotherapy drugs is consistently increasing, about 15 percent a year, and attributes this to the small and focused market for these drugs.

Overall, the article focuses on the cost of cancer treatments and the impact it has on patients. It does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the benefits of these drugs or how they work. The article includes independent reporting and does not appear to be taken from a press release.
Claim: Hard questions about chemo
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This is an important piece about a major problem in healthcare costs in the U.S. Even for people with life-threatening illness (that is not acute, and treated as an inpatient), care is not guaranteed for those who cannot pay. There is enough variation in costs of potential treatment regimens that the practice of informing patients about cost with treatment options should be encouraged. Although distressing, launching a family into financial disaster is an adverse outcome as well. This particular story focuses on the increasing cost of 2nd or 3rd-line chemotherapy drugs aimed at advanced cancer. The story notes that patients are often forced to choose between these treatments and their financial savings. The story explains that because the market for  certain drugs is small and focused, the cost of these chemotherapy drugs is higher. The story appropriately notes that cost should be discussed as an additional side effect of treatment. The story notes via an American Cancer Society rep that it ""costs a billion dollars"" to bring a drugs to market; however, we are not told of the typical profit made from these drugs once they are available to patients. This is an oversight in reporting about cost. There is also considerable debate about the validity of that claim about pharma’s R&D costs – which the story does not address. The story does not discuss how these newer drugs work, or how much quantity and quality of life they add to patients’ lives. The story does not discuss if newer drugs are any better than older drugs for treating cancer. We are told that some newer drugs have fewer or different side effects.

507,"### Context: Texas Governor Rick Perry claims that three Texas counties, Matagorda, Brazoria, and Galveston, opted out of the Social Security program for their employees in 1981 and now have a well-funded retirement program. Perry suggests that states should have the option to decide whether to stay in Social Security or pursue alternative retirement savings plans. A 2005 article from the National Center for Policy Analysis, co-authored by a former Galveston County judge, supports Perry's claim. The article states that county employees in Galveston chose to invest their payroll contributions in fixed-rate guaranteed annuities instead of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. The result was an average annual rate of return of 6.5 percent over 24 years and better benefits in retirement, survivorship, and disability categories compared to Social Security. However, the article also mentions that some retired county workers criticized the plan because they made less money than they would have on Social Security due to hardship withdrawals they made during their working years. The plan was adjusted to close this option in 2005. The article also mentions reviews of the Galveston plan by the U.S. General Accounting Office and the Social Security Administration in 1999. The reviews found that low-paid workers may receive less in monthly retirement payments under the alternate plan compared to Social Security, but workers with higher earnings and fewer dependents generally fare better under the Galveston plan. The reviews also noted that the alternate plan's benefits are fully funded, while Social Security's promised benefits may require increasing program revenues. The Texas plans are still in good health, with guaranteed annual returns and stable contributions. However, the plans lack certain features of Social Security, such as a minimum benefit for lower-income workers, protection from inflation, and required annuitization. The Texas plan is a retirement savings plan based on contributions and investment performance, while Social Security is an insurance plan aimed at preventing poverty in old age. The article concludes that Perry's claim about the Texas counties' retirement program is accurate, but it fails to acknowledge the pre-existing safety net provided by the Austin-based pension plan available to employees in those counties.

508,"### Context: The article titled ""Are You At Risk? 5 Different Types of Prostate Cancer Found"" discusses a new study that has identified five different types of prostate cancer. The article claims that the release of this study fails to provide important information and may be exploiting the results to sell the services of a specific physician.

The article criticizes the news release for not mentioning the cost of the additional genetic test and for not providing data on the accuracy or improved outcomes of genetic testing. It also points out that the potential harm of the test, such as misclassification and over- or under-treatment, is not addressed.

The release is said to lack details on how adding a genetic test helps target treatment and improve outcomes. The study itself is criticized for only looking at biochemical recurrence, which is a weak surrogate for prostate cancer mortality. The release also fails to indicate if the new gene tests are more accurate than current markers.

The article argues that the headline of the release, ""Are you at risk?"", is exploiting the study's results to create worry. It suggests that men with a family history of prostate cancer should engage in shared decision-making with their provider rather than just consulting the mentioned physician for a baseline PSA test.

The article questions if the testing protocol discussed in the release is available and criticizes the lack of clarity on this point. It acknowledges that the findings of the study are newsworthy but argues that the release makes several leaps without providing hard evidence to back up the claims.

Overall, the article suggests that the release may be using the study's results to sell the services of the mentioned physician and criticizes the lack of important information and evidence provided in the release.
Claim: Are You At Risk? 5 Different Types of Prostate Cancer Found
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release puts readers in a worried, defensive posture right from the get-go with its headline, “Are you at risk?” It concludes with a pitch for the services of robotic prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist Dr. David Samadi of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. In between, it briefly recaps a study published in the EBioMedicine journal that apparently discovered “five different types of prostate cancer” (the study characterizes this finding, much more soberly, as “five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles”). The release suggests that genetic testing used in the study is better than current methods at forecasting prostate cancer progression; however, this apparent benefit is never quantified and key limitations of the study are never addressed. The tone is promotional, with links to a Fox news program featuring the surgeon quoted, a link to a “ProstateCancer911” website and the surgeon’s phone number for making an appointment for a consult. The study seems secondary at best. About 220,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States annually, according to the American Cancer Society. The vast majority (98 percent) live at least 10 years after diagnosis and 94 percent are alive 15 years after diagnosis. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, the risk for death increases. This study highlights the possibility that men with high-risk gene profiles would be candidates for more aggressive follow-up treatment following removal of their prostates. The discussion also makes it clear that the value of these risk categories for clinical care remains to be determined. The news release would have done well to communicate that uncertainty more clearly.",Are You At Risk? 5 Different Types of Prostate Cancer Found,"This news release describes a study that identified five different types of prostate cancer. The release does a good job of explaining the different types of prostate cancer and how they differ.

Backers say a Medicare for all system would essentially cut out insurance companies as intermediaries between patients and doctors and instead allow health care providers to seek reimbursement directly from the government. Critics say such a system amounts to government-run health care. Supporters include Sen. Jamie Eldridge of Acton, Rep. Lindsay Sabadosa of Northampton and Rep. Denise Garlick of Needham, all Democrats. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. at the Massachusetts Statehouse.

510,"### Context: The claim that the Black Panther Party created the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is not supported by evidence. The WIC program was enacted in 1972 as an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It provides nutritional assistance to malnourished mothers and children through federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education. The impetus for the legislation came from research in the 1960s that identified hunger and malnutrition as a major national problem. The White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health in 1969 concluded that hunger and poverty existed on a large scale in the United States and urged the federal government to take action. The Nixon administration launched pilot programs, but they did not produce the desired results. In 1972, Congress passed a bill containing the WIC amendment and improvements to existing school nutrition programs.

While the Black Panther Party did launch a community food program called Free Breakfast for Children in 1968, there is no evidence that they operated a program called WIC or one that closely resembled the USDA program. The Free Breakfast for Children program provided meals to impoverished children and may have influenced the federal government's school breakfast program, but it was not the same as WIC. The federal School Breakfast Program, established in 1966, was already in operation when the Black Panther Party started their community-based programs.

The Panthers' free breakfast program exposed the shortcomings of government food assistance programs, including school breakfasts. However, it is unlikely that their program served as an exact prototype for the WIC legislation. The federal WIC program had a broader scope, focusing on supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, as well as infants and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk.

While the Panthers played a role in highlighting the shortcomings of government food assistance programs, historian Susan Levine suggests that lobbying groups like the Committee on School Lunch Participation had a greater influence on federal policy. The Panthers' program for free breakfasts was primarily for children, while WIC had a broader focus. The federal School Breakfast Program, separate from WIC, had already been in operation for three years before the Panthers' program.

In conclusion, the claim that the Black Panther Party created the WIC program is not supported by evidence. The WIC program was enacted by Congress in 1972 as an amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. While the Panthers' free breakfast program may have influenced government food assistance programs, it was not the same as WIC and had a narrower focus on providing meals to children.
Claim: The Black Panther Party created the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program that provides supplemental food assistance to single mothers and their children.

511,"### Context: West Virginia has the opportunity to elect an all-female congressional delegation, which would be unprecedented in the state's history. Currently, West Virginia has only elected two women to Congress in its 155-year history. Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito is the state's only current female representative. However, in the upcoming November elections, Democrat Kendra Fershee will face incumbent Republican David McKinley in the 1st District, Democrat Talley Sergent will meet 2nd District GOP Rep. Alex Mooney, and Republican Carol Miller will take on Democrat Richard Ojeda in the 3rd District.

The surge in female candidates, mostly Democrats, has been expected since the Women's March demonstrations following President Donald Trump's inauguration in January 2017. This year, five women ran in the three U.S. House primary races in West Virginia, compared to none in 2016. Historically, West Virginia's congressional delegation has not been friendly towards women, with only two women serving in Congress before. The first woman elected to Congress from West Virginia was Maude Kee, who served from 1951 to 1964. She was succeeded by her son, James. The only other congresswoman from the state is Capito, who served in the House from 2000 to 2014 before being elected as a U.S. senator.

Among the three current female candidates, Carol Miller is the only one with experience in political office, having served 12 years in the state House of Delegates. Talley Sergent, the state presidential campaign director for Hillary Clinton in 2016, was motivated to run due to her frustration with the Republican-controlled Congress's work on the health care overhaul and the state's opioid epidemic. Kendra Fershee, a West Virginia University law professor, was turned off by Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and the voting record of incumbent David McKinley.

The article highlights the personal motivations of the female candidates, such as Sergent's sister's addiction and Fershee's desire to make a difference. The women believe that Congress is not adequately addressing the issues facing West Virginia, particularly the opioid epidemic. They hope to bring West Virginia values to Washington, D.C. and fight for their constituents.

Overall, West Virginia has the opportunity to make history by electing an all-female congressional delegation, reflecting the national surge in female candidates. The women running for office are motivated to bring about change and address the pressing issues facing the state.

512,"### Context: The claim that San Antonio has seen ""67% growth"" in water customers ""in the last 25 years, 0% more water used"" is not accurate. The data provided by the San Antonio Water System shows that from 1984 to 2009, the population served by the utility increased by nearly 68% while water produced decreased by 2.9%. However, this data is not from the latest 25-year time span when the claim was made. The most recent data available when the claim was made, covering 1986-2011, shows that as the population served grew 52%, water usage increased by 21%. 

San Antonio has been praised for its water conservation efforts and is considered a model for other cities. The city has implemented various approaches to tackle water worries, including smarter use of water from the Edwards Aquifer, pumping all allowed Edwards water and storing the excess in the Carrizo Aquifer, and developing new sources such as a desalination plant. The city also focuses on conservation by educating users, subsidizing ways to use less water, and giving away low-flow toilets.

The trend statewide in Texas is towards less water use, with per-person water use decreasing due to state and federal standards for water efficiency. San Antonio has reduced per-person water use from around 200 gallons a day in the 1980s to about 140 gallons a day now.

The claim that San Antonio has seen ""67% growth"" in water customers ""in the last 25 years, 0% more water used"" is based on outdated data and does not accurately reflect the city's water usage. While San Antonio has made significant progress in water conservation, the data shows that water usage has increased along with population growth.

513,"### Context: Democratic Congresswoman Judy Chu of Los Angeles County claimed that the GOP health care bill would allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition. PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker both rejected this claim, stating that the bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition. However, conditions stemming from sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be considered pre-existing conditions. States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with existing conditions, potentially making coverage unaffordable. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions. The GOP bill weakens these protections. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as treatment for sexually transmitted illnesses or mental health issues. The Republican bill might make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions, including victims of sexual assault, to get affordable health care coverage. However, the bill does not specifically single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. The bill leaves it up to insurance companies or individual states to decide what constitutes a pre-existing condition. The lack of transparency and potential for different policies from state to state could put a significant burden on consumers trying to obtain insurance based on their health status. The bill could have a chilling effect on victims of sexual assault, as they might choose not to seek medical treatment out of fear that it could affect their ability to get health insurance in the future. Overall, the claim that the GOP health bill would allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition is misleading, as the bill does not specifically target these conditions but could make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions, including victims of sexual assault, to obtain affordable health care coverage.
Claim: The GOP health bill ""would once again allow being a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.

Several websites have since softened their headlines to be more careful, going from ""would"" to ""could."" The bill does not change what is or is not a pre-existing condition; the health insurance companies write those definitions for themselves. The House bill also does not single out sexual assault or any other medical issue as a pre-existing condition. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, some victims of sexual assault said they had trouble getting health insurance because they sought medical services that the insurance companies viewed as evidence of a pre-existing condition, such as for sexually transmitted illness or mental health. The Republican bill might make it harder for people who have pre-existing conditions to get affordable health care coverage. Victims of sexual assault would face the same challenge as others with pre-existing conditions. But we don’t know for sure given the bill’s current form. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. UPDATE: This fact check has been updated with a response from Rep. Chu, who issued a statement on May 10, 2017, which reads in full: ""As it stands today, anybody with a preexisting condition is protected thanks to the Affordable Care Act. This includes women, who were previously charged more for a range of care that is, today, considered ‘essential’. The AHCA makes it easier for insurers to earn waivers to charge more for preexisting conditions and leaves the question of what should be covered up to others. In my statement, I said that this bill ‘would once again allow a rape or domestic violence victim to be a pre-existing condition.’ While the many fact checks have pointed out that a number of conditions would have to be met first, like state waivers, the fact is that what is currently prohibited has once again become possible thanks to the AHCA.

514,"### Context: The claim that President Donald Trump has targeted the family of California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de León for deportation is false. The claim originated from a dubious website called Proud-Patriots.com, which falsely reported that de León's family had been targeted for deportation by Trump because they are allegedly all undocumented. The article uses quotes from a speech given by de León in which he stated that half of his family would be eligible for deportation under Trump's executive order. However, the article provides no evidence that Trump or Immigration and Customs Enforcement had targeted or was about to target de León's family. 

A spokesperson for de León clarified that the family members to whom the senator was referring have already become naturalized United States citizens or permanent residents. The senator's remarks were made in relation to a 25 January 2017 executive order signed by Trump, which aimed to enhance immigration law enforcement, particularly in ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions. 

In summary, the claim that President Trump has targeted the family of Kevin de León for deportation is false. The article that originated the claim provides no evidence to support it, and a spokesperson for de León confirmed that the family members in question are already naturalized citizens or permanent residents.

515,"### Context: The claim that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the implementation of a gun buy-back program in 1997 is not supported by statistics. In fact, the firearms homicide rate in Australia has decreased significantly since the introduction of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) in 1996. The NFA included measures such as gun buybacks, voluntary surrenders, and stricter gun owner licensing.

A peer-reviewed study published in 2012 found that firearm homicides and suicides dropped significantly in the decade following the NFA. Another study from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in 2011 concluded that the NFA had been successful in reducing gun massacres, firearm homicides, and firearm suicides.

While it is true that gun deaths were already declining in Australia prior to the implementation of the NFA, many studies still found strong evidence for the beneficial effect of the law. However, it is important to note that the Australian experience may not be fully replicable in the United States due to factors such as Australia's controlled borders and highly organized government and law enforcement services.

The article also mentions a misleading and outdated online piece from 2001 that claimed crime rates had increased in Australia since the NFA was introduced. However, this claim is not supported by current data. The rates of various types of violent crimes in Australia, such as sexual assault, kidnapping, and homicides of all types, have remained relatively stable. The robbery rate did increase in the 1998-2001 timeframe but has since dropped below its pre-NFA level.

In conclusion, the claim that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the gun buy-back program in 1997 is not accurate. The implementation of the NFA has led to a significant decrease in firearm homicides and suicides in Australia.
Claim: Statistics demonstrate that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the government there instituted a gun buy-back program in 1997.

516,"### Context: The article claims that the cigarette brand Newport is planning to introduce marijuana cigarettes called ""Newport Nirvana."" According to the article, Reynolds American Inc. Chief Marketing Executive Lawrence Harrison stated in an interview that the company has been monitoring the cannabis market for some time and decided to take part in it after the legalization initiatives in Colorado and Washington. The company has reportedly purchased thousands of acres of land to grow natural hemp and is setting up a distribution process across North and South American territories. 

However, it is important to note that the article is from the website TMZWorldNews, which is known for publishing fake news. The website appropriates the name of the popular gossip site TMZ but does not include a disclaimer warning readers that its content is entirely false. The article also mentions previous fabrications from TMZWorldNews and related pages, including false claims about a police officer shooting a black baby, a penile implant alerting women to cheating partners, a college student falling into a coma after a social media semen-drinking challenge, KKK members committing suicide due to the Harriet Tubman $20 bill, a non-existent study about the sexuality of black men in Atlanta, and a satanic dungeon under a Chuck E. Cheese (similar to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory).

Therefore, it is highly likely that the claim about Newport developing marijuana cigarettes is also false. The article does not provide any credible sources or evidence to support the claim.
Claim: Newport developed marijuana cigarettes which will be available for purchase ""next year.

517,"### Context: The claim that white Irish slaves outnumbered black slaves in early America and were treated worse is not supported by historical evidence. The article explains that indentured servitude, where individuals worked off their passage to the New World, was common in the original 13 colonies. Many impoverished Europeans, including men, women, and children from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Germany, were brought over as indentured servants. However, the article debunks the notion that the Irish were shipped to the New World as ""white slaves."" The author argues that the Irish slave narrative is a myth and that people are conflating indentured servitude with chattel slavery.

The article highlights the work of Liam Hogan, a research librarian and historian, who has debunked the Irish slaves myth. Hogan argues that there were no Irish slaves in the Americas and that indentured servitude and chattel slavery were two distinct forms of servitude with significant differences. Chattel slavery was perpetual, hereditary, and based on race, while indentured servitude had time limits and allowed for legal recourse if mistreated.

The article also discusses the resurgence of the Irish slaves narrative in recent years, attributing it to increasing racial tensions in the United States. White supremacists and conspiracy theorists have promoted the idea of ""white slavery"" to absolve white Europeans of blame for the transatlantic slave trade. The narrative is described as a form of nativism and racism masquerading as a conspiracy theory.

The article acknowledges that thousands of Irish people were forcibly brought to the New World as indentured servants, but questions whether they should be referred to as ""slaves."" Some argue that the labor they did was slave labor and their circumstances were worse than voluntary indentured workers. However, the article suggests that using the term ""slavery"" for forced labor blurs historical distinctions and lacks respect for the facts.

In conclusion, the claim that white Irish slaves outnumbered black slaves in early America and were treated worse is not supported by historical evidence. The article debunks the Irish slave narrative and emphasizes the differences between indentured servitude and chattel slavery.

What's false: Unlike institutionalized chattel slavery, indentured servitude was neither hereditary nor lifelong; unlike black slaves, white indentured servants had legal rights; unlike black slaves, indentured servants weren't considered property.","Early in America's history, white Irish slaves outnumbered black slaves and endured worse treatment at the hands of their masters.","What's true: Thousands of impoverished Irishmen, women, and children were forcibly brought to the New World to work off their passage as indentured servants.

518,"### Context: The claim that 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation goes to the Clintons or their staff for travel, salaries, and benefits, while only 15 cents goes to charitable beneficiaries, is partially true but ignores critical facts. The Clinton Foundation operates differently from other foundations as it keeps its money in-house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs. This makes it difficult to analyze the foundation's finances using traditional methods. Charity Navigator, a leading independent group that tracks charities, has stopped rating the Clinton Foundation because its atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in their current rating methodology.

The Federalist article cited by Rush Limbaugh, which analyzed the Clinton Foundation's tax forms, found that between 2009 and 2012, only 15 percent of the money raised went to programmatic grants, while the bulk of the money went to travel expenses, employee salaries and benefits, and other expenses. However, the Clinton Foundation combines its finances with an affiliated organization, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which works to lower the costs of HIV/AIDS treatment in the developing world. By combining the finances of both organizations, the Clinton Foundation claims that over 88 percent of its expenditures go directly to its life-changing work. However, the correct number for the Clinton Foundation alone in 2013 was just over 80 percent.

The Clinton Foundation's financials categorize a relatively small amount of money as grants, as their charitable work is mostly done by their own employees. The foundation argues that salaries and travel for those directly carrying out their mission are different from those for executives who raise funds or manage the organization. The foundation's expenditures for programs include salaries for staff, large-scale conferences, training for beneficiaries, and direct program expenses.

While the claim that only 15 cents of every dollar goes to charitable beneficiaries is partially true, it ignores the fact that the Clinton Foundation does most of its charitable work in-house. The foundation's spending on charitable programs, even when combined with the Clinton Health Access Initiative, exceeds industry standards. The average reported across all organizations in the National Center for Charitable Statistics is 81 percent, and the Better Business Bureau's Wise Giving Alliance suggests a minimum of 65 percent.

In conclusion, while the claim contains some truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression of the Clinton Foundation's spending.
Claim: Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Limbaugh said ""85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."" There’s a grain of truth here -- roughly 85 percent of the foundation’s spending was for items other than charitable grants to other organizations, and a large chunk of this 85 percent did go to Clinton Foundation staff for travel, salaries and benefits. However, the foundation says it does most of its charitable work in-house, and it’s not credible to think that the foundation spent zero dollars beyond grants on any charitable work, which is what it would take for Limbaugh to be correct. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.","Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary.","Limbaugh said, """"Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits.

519,"### Context: Prince Harry and Elton John have launched a billion-dollar project called ""MenStar"" that aims to target men living with or at risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The region has been heavily affected by AIDS since the 1980s. The MenStar coalition aims to address the lack of awareness of HIV prevention among hard-to-reach young men. At the launch event, South African actress Charlize Theron and Ndaba Mandela, the grandson of Nelson Mandela, also spoke in support of the campaign.

According to the United Nations' HIV/AIDS body UNAIDS, there are around 36.7 million people worldwide living with HIV. However, fewer than half of men living with HIV receive treatment, compared to 60 percent of women. Elton John emphasized the need for a global coalition to teach men to protect themselves from HIV, as this would also help protect their partners, family members, and communities.

UNAIDS recently warned that the fight against HIV/AIDS is ""slipping off track,"" with rates of new HIV infections threatening efforts to defeat the disease. The MenStar campaign launch comes at a time when new and innovative solutions are needed more than ever before, according to Prince Harry.

The MenStar project is supported by the U.S. government's PEPFAR program for tackling HIV/AIDS and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The goal of experts at the conference is to eliminate AIDS worldwide by 2030. However, the United Nations highlighted a funding gap of £4.6 billion that could hinder these efforts.

In summary, Prince Harry and Elton John have launched the MenStar campaign to target men living with or at risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The campaign aims to address the lack of awareness of HIV prevention among young men and increase treatment rates. The project is supported by PEPFAR and the Gates Foundation. The goal is to eliminate AIDS worldwide by 2030, but a funding gap threatens these efforts.

520,"### Context: The article debunks the claim that a ""coronavirus challenge"" or ""COVID-19 challenge"" is spreading on social media platforms like TikTok and Twitter. It criticizes news outlets for reporting on these challenges without providing evidence that they actually exist. The article highlights that teenagers engaging in dangerous behavior, such as licking doorknobs and floors to contract COVID-19, is not supported by any substantial evidence. The outlets quote adults who state the obvious, that it would be ""stupid"" to purposely catch the virus. The article questions whether the teenagers are ""really stupid"" or if the adults are behaving stupidly by taking these claims at face value without critical thinking.

The article mentions that TikTok responded to the claims by stating that it removes videos that encourage dangerous challenges. However, there is no validation that users are actually licking public objects as part of a ""coronavirus challenge"" en masse. The article also highlights that there are only a few instances of individuals licking toilet seats and calling it a ""coronavirus challenge."" These individuals admitted that their motivations were attention and money, and they disinfected the toilet seats before licking them.

The article criticizes news outlets for feeding into the cycle of disinformation by reporting on these claims without verification. It mentions previous instances where media outlets covered viral challenges, such as the Blue Whale challenge and the Momo challenge, without proper verification. The article argues that news organizations benefit from the engagement generated by these stories, while social media platforms also benefit from the increased activity.

The article concludes by noting that news outlets failed to provide useful information about COVID-19 and instead focused on a potentially fake ""coronavirus challenge."" It highlights that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the main mode of transmission is person-to-person, not through contact with contaminated surfaces. The chance of someone getting infected from licking a toilet seat is considered small. The article criticizes tabloids for focusing on a debatably fake challenge instead of reporting useful information about the virus.

521,"### Context: The article discusses a tweet attributed to the World Health Organization (WHO) that circulated in April 2020, suggesting that the organization claimed there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The tweet, which was timestamped January 14, 2020, stated that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.

However, the article clarifies that the tweet was presented with misleading and inaccurate context. The WHO tweet was authentic and unaltered, but it was taken out of context. The tweet actually stated that preliminary investigations conducted by Chinese authorities found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China. The tweet was based on the information available at the time, just five days after the identification of SARS-CoV-2.

The article provides additional information from the WHO's updates and statements during that period. On January 12, 2020, the WHO received detailed information about the outbreak and confirmed cases in Wuhan. The WHO also mentioned that China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus on January 12, which was important for developing diagnostic kits.

The WHO continued to provide updates and guidance on COVID-19, including a field visit to Wuhan on January 21, 2020, and the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. On February 11, 2020, the WHO officially named the illness caused by the novel coronavirus as COVID-19.

The article concludes by stating that claims that the WHO underestimated COVID-19 are implausible. The organization repeatedly urged governments to contain the disease and officially declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The tweet in question was taken out of context and does not reflect the WHO's overall response to the pandemic.

522,"### Context: Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas quoted Martin Luther King Jr. in his endorsement of legislation targeting transgender access to bathrooms. However, the origin of the quote is unclear. A web search yielded no confirmation that King made the exact statement, though President Clinton and Sen. Joe Lieberman have also quoted King in a similar manner. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research Institute at Stanford University was unable to confirm the quote, as their resources are not easily searchable. While King did make a similar statement about standing up for what is right, it is unclear if he made the exact quote attributed to him by Patrick. King experts have stated that it would require further research to determine if King made the specific statement. However, King did make a similar statement in a speech in Selma, Alabama in 1965, where he spoke about the importance of standing up for justice and truth. A King biographer and Texas historians have stated that Patrick used the quote out of historical context, as King was advocating for the expansion of rights for African-Americans, not the restriction of rights for transgender people. Overall, while Patrick attributed the quote to King, there is no concrete evidence that King made the exact statement.

523,"### Context: The article claims that aspirin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, the information provided in the article is not accurate and lacks important details. The article mentions that people who took a low dose of aspirin every day for several years reduced their risk of developing Alzheimer's by 13 percent. However, the study itself reported that low-dose aspirin did not result in a significant reduction in Alzheimer's disease.

The article fails to mention the cost of treatment, which is important information for readers. It also only lists stomach bleeding and ulcers as side effects of aspirin without mentioning how often these occur. It should have mentioned that the bleeding risks associated with aspirin use increase with age.

The evidence presented in the article is confusing. The writer disregards the results of a randomized clinical trial in favor of an epidemiologic study that found a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease with high doses of aspirin. The conclusion of the study itself states that controlled trials are warranted to determine if aspirin can protect against Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is presumptuous for the journalist to conclude that regular aspirin use may lower the risk of Alzheimer's.

The article does not contain material from individuals with expertise in this area and does not discuss any other approaches under investigation for the prevention or delay of Alzheimer's disease. It also fails to mention that low-dose aspirin is a readily available over-the-counter product.

Although the article accurately explains that studies examining the relationship between aspirin and Alzheimer's disease have been conducted over a period of time, it seems to draw on the results from different research studies and does not rely exclusively on a press release.

In summary, the article's claim that aspirin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease is not accurately reported. The article lacks important information, presents confusing evidence, and fails to provide a comprehensive view of the topic.
Claim: The Claim: Aspirin Can Reduce the Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story – about whether aspirin can prevent Alzheimer’s disease – only ran about 210 words. It could have used more space to clear up the confusion it causes in reviewing the evidence. The results of the most recent research on the topic, though conducted as a randomized clincial trial, were disregarded in favor of the more appealing result – i.e. that a common, readily available product can be used to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. It would have been far more useful to explain about why there may be discrepancies between research studies, how a reader might go about assessing the information, and, when there are differences in outcomes,  how one can make a decision about the options. The story stated that “people who took a low dose of aspirin every day for several years reduced their risk of developing Alzheimer’s by 13 percent.”  However the study itself reported that use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significant reduction in Alzheimer’s disease. Thus the story did not accurately report on these results and compounded this with its concluding statement. The story only listed stomach bleeding and ulcers as side effects of aspirin.

524,"### Context: The article discusses a meme that compares the responses of different presidents to mass shootings. The meme claims that previous presidents, such as Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, offered words of comfort and solidarity, while Donald Trump used the opportunity to brag about crowd sizes and attack a political opponent. The article confirms that the meme accurately quotes the previous presidents' statements, but it also highlights that Trump's behavior in visiting the affected cities was not accurately represented.

The article explains that Trump was criticized for smiling and offering a thumbs-up gesture while visiting an infant whose parents had been killed in the El Paso shooting. There were also allegations that his administration had hired ""fake"" medical staff to pose with him at a hospital in Dayton. However, the article states that Trump did offer words of solidarity and comfort to the victims, their families, and the affected communities during his visits.

The first quotation in the meme is from Bill Clinton's remarks after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. The second quotation is from George W. Bush's speech after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007. The third quotation is from Barack Obama's speech after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. The fourth quotation is from Trump's remarks during a visit to a hospital in El Paso after the Walmart shooting in 2019.

The article acknowledges that Trump's remarks about crowd sizes and his political opponent during his visit to El Paso were inappropriate. However, it also points out that Trump gave a relatively dignified speech from the White House, expressing solidarity and comfort to the victims and their families.

The key difference between Trump and his predecessors, according to the article, was Trump's comportment and behavior when he stepped away from the podium. While the meme accurately quotes the previous presidents' statements, it presents an incomplete and misleading picture of Trump's overall behavior during his visits to the affected cities.

In conclusion, the article rates the truth of the meme as a ""Mixture"" because it accurately quotes the previous presidents' statements but does not accurately represent Trump's overall comportment and behavior during his visits to El Paso and Dayton.

However, the article fails to provide important information about the cost and potential harms of the test. The cost of scanning everyone who smokes daily would range from $9.9 to $33 billion annually. Additionally, the false positive rate of the test, which can lead to unnecessary additional testing, is not mentioned. The article also fails to compare the new study to a previous study by Dr. Claudia Henschke, which was controversial and discredited. The article does mention the importance of smoking cessation in preventing lung cancer deaths and notes that about 10% of smokers develop lung cancer. The study raises many questions that will likely be debated by experts, but the article does not provide any independent voices to the discussion. The article does mention that almost all advanced CT scanners can perform a spiral CT and that about 60% of U.S. hospitals have such a machine. The article relies heavily on press releases, including quotes from the study's leader, Dr. Denise Aberle, and Dr. Christine Berg, without proper attribution.

Smoking rates and the incidence of lung cancer have been falling in the US for several years. Despite these gratifying trends, about 225,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 and approximately 157,000 will die from the disease. A major factor in survival after diagnosis is early detection. Chest X-rays are not sensitive enough to pick up lung cancer in its early stages. That is why more sophisticated diagnostic testing has been sought. Spiral computerized tomography (CT) has been touted as the best way to diagnose lung cancer early and save ives. This landmark study has demonstrated that spiral CT’s are indeed more senstive than chest X-rays and that early detection can save lives. The study is by no means a complete answer, and it raises many questions. Who should be screened, when, how often and who is going to pay the enormous bill are some of the obvious questions.

526,"### Context: State prosecutors are facing challenges in drunken-driving cases due to restrictive new evidence standards. These rules, which were implemented as part of legal reform legislation in 2011, make it more difficult to admit police testimony and field sobriety tests into court. The legislation was primarily aimed at blocking unreliable expert testimony and junk science in negligence lawsuits against businesses, but it applies to all civil and criminal actions, including charges of operating while intoxicated (OWI).

The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed that the legislation made it easier for drunk drivers who kill to evade punishment. They cited three pieces of evidence to support their claim: opposition from Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD), limits on punitive damages in civil cases, and changes that make it harder for people to testify as experts. However, the claim regarding punitive damages is inaccurate as drunk-driving crash victims are exempt from these limits. MADD initially opposed the legislation but dropped its opposition after the punitive damage exemption was added. They are now seeking a partial legislative fix in response to the new evidence rules.

Prosecutors argue that the new evidence rules put additional pressure on them. The changes have been significant but generally welcomed in concept, as the old standards allowed in too much evidence. The new standards are already used in federal courts and by more than 30 states. While there have been challenges to OWI evidence under the new law, there have been no reported cases of OWI homicide trials being affected by the new evidence standards.

Both prosecutors and defense lawyers in states that already have similar evidence standards have found them to be fairly neutral. Prosecutors have to work harder to defend the reliability of tests and witnesses, while defense attorneys have to introduce better and more reliable evidence. The new standards prevent the defense from using bogus or questionable experts.

Looking ahead, arresting officers and sobriety tests are being challenged under the new system. Judges now act as gatekeepers for reliable and relevant scientific testimony, whereas in the past, juries heard almost everything. Some judges have concerns about certain tests, such as the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test, which is not allowed as evidence in some states.

Overall, the claim that the legislation makes it easier for drunk drivers who kill to evade punishment has some element of truth. Some defendants have found an easier road due to challenges to scientific evidence. However, it is misleading to suggest that the intent of the legislation was to favor homicidal drunk drivers. Both defense and prosecution are subject to the new evidence standards, and even defense-side experts do not believe it makes it easier for drunk drivers.

Mitsotakis argued that purchasing patent rights would provide global pharmaceutical companies with incentives for further research and development, while also ensuring that European taxpayers' money is spent sensibly. The suggestion to buy patent rights was initially proposed by Elias Mossialos, a professor of health policy at the London School of Economics, who has been appointed as Greece's representative in international talks on tackling the coronavirus.

Mossialos explained that the cost for patent rights could be distributed among EU countries, and this approach would only be used in extreme cases such as a pandemic. He reassured that it would not negatively impact the sustainability of the medical technology industry. By securing patent rights at an EU level, the production of tests and vaccines could be expanded to multiple locations, enabling wider distribution.

Europe has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 130,000 cases reported. Italy and Spain have been particularly hard-hit by the virus. The proposal to purchase patent rights for vaccines and tests aims to address the urgent need for a rapid and fair distribution of these resources once they are proven effective.

In summary, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has suggested that the EU should buy patent rights for vaccines and coronavirus tests to ensure their rapid and fair distribution. This proposal, initially put forward by health policy professor Elias Mossialos, aims to incentivize further research and development while utilizing European taxpayers' money effectively. By securing patent rights at an EU level, the production and distribution of these medical resources can be expanded to multiple locations.

528,"### Context: The article titled ""Drugs may make stents deadly, study says"" discusses a new study that suggests an increased risk of fatal blood clots associated with the use of drug-coated stents. The article mentions that the actual magnitude of this risk ranges from 0.6% to 2.6% of patients, but fails to quantify the harms associated with the use of plain metal stents. It also does not provide information about the difference in risk of re-stenosis and thrombosis between these two types of stents.

The article states that patients with drug-coated stents have 30-40% less collateral blood-vessel function compared to those with bare-metal stents. However, it does not explain the absolute difference in collateral blood vessel function or how much is needed for optimum protection. The article also does not fully describe the development of collateral circulation and how less collateral circulation increases the risk to the heart muscle when a clot blocks a portion of the blood supply.

The article lacks information about when the use of a stent is indicated or not, which gives it a disease mongering quality. It quotes one of the authors of the study and an investigator in the field, but does not provide adequate information about treatment options for individuals with partial blockage of coronary arteries. It also fails to mention the role of medical therapy either without stenting or after stent placement.

Although the article mentions the importance of selecting the correct stent for each patient, it does not provide guidance on how to discuss this with doctors. It states that 80% of Americans who are treated with a stent receive a drug-coated stent, but does not mention the indications for stent placement.

Overall, the article reports on the observations from a new study but lacks important information and fails to quantify the benefits and harms associated with different types of stents.
Claim: Drugs may make stents deadly, study says
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"First, this is a review of a story originally reported by the Milwaukee Journal, which was picked up – and shortened – by the Seattle Times. This story presents the results from a recently published study comparing the formation of new collateral blood vessels to provide the heart muscle with blood in patients with bare-metal and drug-coated stents. The study found that people with the drug-coated stents had less formation of these vessels. The implication of this was not clearly presented in the story, but with fewer vessels formed, if vessels become blocked, there is less capacity to provide the heart muscle with blood. So there is increased risk of heart muscle damage and death. The story neglected to present the complete array of treatment options for the management of coronary artery disease and did not provide the reader with information on the guideline criteria for the use of stents. This information is necessary for the reader to understand the interventions available for coronary artery disease and to help them with treatment decisions they may face.","Drugs may make stents deadly, study says","This story reports on a new study that suggests an increased risk of fatal blood clots associated with the use of drug-coated stents.

529,"### Context: The claim that Nike donated three times more to Republicans than Democrats during the 2018 federal election cycle is accurate, but it requires clarification. The donations were not made by the company itself, but rather by its political action committee (PAC) and individuals listed as employees of Nike. The Center for Responsive Politics, which reported on the donations, explained that they categorize campaign contributions based on the individuals associated with the institution rather than the organization itself. They believe there is a correlation between individuals' contributions and their employers' political interests. 

In the case of Nike, their PAC and employees contributed a total of $547,107 in campaign donations during the 2017-18 election cycle. Of that total, 78 percent ($424,600) went to Republicans and 22 percent ($122,449) went to Democrats. However, it is important to note that the inclusion of contributions by Phil Knight, the billionaire co-founder of Nike and a prolific Republican donor, significantly skewed the partisan breakdown. Knight, who is no longer an employee of Nike, exclusively contributed to Republican campaign committees and candidates. His donations, along with those of his wife, made up almost half of the total donations from Nike employees and the Nike PAC. 

When looking specifically at Nike's PAC, their contributions were much more evenly split between the two main parties. As of September 2018, the Nike Inc. Federal PAC had donated $79,500 to Democratic candidates and $64,000 to Republican candidates. However, when considering donations made by Nike's PAC to other political action committees and campaign committees, the ratio flips, with Nike's PAC donating $104,000 to Republican PACs and candidates and $96,500 to Democratic PACs and candidates. 

In conclusion, while it is true that donors associated with Nike contributed more to Republican candidates than Democrats during the 2018 federal election cycle, it is important to clarify that these donations were made by individuals and the company's PAC, not the company itself. The inclusion of donations by Phil Knight, who is no longer an employee of Nike, significantly skewed the partisan breakdown. Additionally, when looking solely at Nike's PAC, their contributions were fairly evenly split between the two parties.

530,"### Context: The article discusses a new portable scanner for breast cancer and raises questions about its cost implications and effectiveness compared to mammography. The article points out that without knowing the sensitivity and specificity of the scanner, it is difficult to determine its role in breast cancer screening. Poor sensitivity could lead to missed cancers, while poor specificity could result in unnecessary biopsies and treatments. The article also questions whether the scanner will be covered by insurance and highlights the need for clinical trials to determine its effectiveness. The article criticizes the lack of discussion about potential downsides and the absence of clinical evidence supporting the scanner. It suggests that the scanner may still be in the prototype stage and emphasizes the importance of evaluating its performance in human beings. The article mentions prior research with RF and microwave technologies in detecting breast cancer and raises the question of whether the new scanner improves survival. It also highlights the challenge of distinguishing between cancer and ""pre-cancer"" and the need to assess if the scanner can help people live longer. The article concludes by mentioning statistics about mammography and breast cancer in younger women, but questions the source of these statistics.
Claim: New Portable Scanner for Breast Cancer
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Nowhere do we hear how far along the research is. The main section doesn’t even allude to evidence, other than to state that more research is to be done, which is true about most everything in medicine except limes for scurvy. As far as a reader can tell, the “new portable scanner” may have yet to leave a laboratory setting. All we know is that it’s been submitted to, and is a finalist for, an engineering & technology award. It’s not the same as clinical research. The article is quick to point out mammography’s low detection rates (sensitivity, perhaps?) in younger women, identifying the problem to be solved, but it never tells us the detection rates for the new tool. The data very well may be unknown. Which means detection rates could be worse! But from the structure of this article, focusing on technology but not evidence, a reader could only conclude the new kid on the block is superior. If we’re lucky, the new kid will make the world a better place. But filing a patent for a device is not the same level of proof as clinical research. People would be shocked to learn how many promising ideas from labs and napkins never survive clinical trials, how many prove to be worse for mankind than what we already do. Science is hard and complex. Last year’s uproar over the new mammography guidelines highlighted that there are important subtleties about screening for cancer, and that clear, balanced communication is crucial. It may sound like we ask a lot of journalists. But really, asking one more question would’ve turned this story around: How far along is this idea? The answer leads us to look beyond the novelty, beyond the theoretical benefits, beyond the entangled claims of the institution and inventor who stand to benefit, and see, simply, whether this idea is better or worse or needs 4 more years in the oven before we can even ask. Mammography isn’t perfect, and an improved screening technique for breast cancer could reduce pain, suffering, and death for many women. But that need doesn’t give journalists a license to hype.",New Portable Scanner for Breast Cancer,"The story reports on a new technology for detecting breast cancer.

The incident occurred in 2003 when Polanski won the Academy Award for Best Director for his film ""The Pianist."" The article includes a clip of Harrison Ford announcing Polanski as the winner, followed by Streep and other celebrities giving him a standing ovation. 

The article also mentions that Polanski had fled to Poland in 1978 to avoid child sexual assault charges. In 2009, when Polanski was arrested amid another failed extradition attempt, Streep expressed sympathy for him, stating, ""I'm very sorry he's in jail."" This quote has been circulated to argue that Streep is hypocritical in her criticism of Trump.

The article concludes by referencing a post from Twitchy, a social media curation site, which suggests that Streep's standing ovation of Polanski is one of the reasons conservatives dislike Hollywood.

In summary, the article highlights Meryl Streep's previous support of Roman Polanski, an accused pedophile, by giving him a standing ovation at the Oscars. This information is relevant to the claim that Streep's standing ovation of Polanski was brought up after her speech criticizing Donald Trump, suggesting a potential hypocrisy in her actions.

532,"### Context: The article discusses Suzanne Somers' advocacy for a ""natural"" approach to treating menopause. It mentions that the article does not provide a cost estimate for bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), but it does mention the price of Suzanne Somers' book, ""Ageless."" The potential benefits of BHRT are not quantified in the article. One clinician is quoted as saying that these products are potentially dangerous because they lack FDA approval, but it does not clarify whether they failed to obtain approval or are exempt from seeking it. The article suggests that it would have been helpful to inform readers about the specific dangers and provide a way to gauge the actual risk posed.

The article includes testimonies from actresses about the benefits of bioidentical hormones, but it does not provide any metrics for gauging these benefits or assurance that there is actual data supporting these claims. The language used to discuss menopause, such as ""fighting off nasty symptoms"" and ""constant and progressive deterioration,"" is described as disease-mongering. The article also criticizes the imbalance in the amount of space given to Suzanne Somers' opinions compared to the opinions of two physicians.

The article points out that the opening statement about the hormone fountain of youth being turned off may lead readers to believe that hormone replacement therapy is difficult to obtain, which is not accurate. It also mentions that the symptoms listed for menopause are not necessarily linked to it, and there are treatments available for problems like depression and weakening bones that are not mentioned in the article.

The article criticizes the lack of focus on bioidentical hormones despite the headline and introduction suggesting otherwise. It suggests that the article should have mentioned the controversy and confusion surrounding the term ""bioidenticals,"" as some are FDA-approved while others are not. The article also notes that the treatment of menopause symptoms with BHRT is not new and that Suzanne Somers' claims are not new either, as she published a book on the topic in 2004. The article concludes by stating that it does not appear to rely on a press release.

533,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that flashing your car's high beams at a traffic signal will cause it to change from red to green more quickly. It explains that many motorists have tried this and believe it works because they have seen the light change after flashing their high beams. However, the article argues that this belief is a result of the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy, where people assume that because two events occur together, one must have caused the other.

The article explains that traffic signals are equipped with sensors that respond to the flashing of strobe lights on emergency vehicles. These sensors are part of traffic pre-emption systems that allow emergency vehicles to pass through intersections more quickly and safely by providing them with a steady stream of green lights. The adventurous motorist tries to trick these sensors by rapidly flashing their high beams, assuming that it will cause the light to change. However, the article points out that in many cases, the perceived results are simply coincidences, as the light was already about to change from red to green.

The article also mentions that advance sensors are placed in the road ahead of controlled intersections. These sensors detect the passage of a vehicle and place a ""call"" to the next traffic signal. If no vehicles are waiting at the next cross street, the signal changes from red to green to allow the oncoming car to flow through smoothly. The distance at which drivers start flashing their high beams to influence upcoming signals is often the same distance where advance sensors are placed. This can create the illusion that flashing the high beams causes the lights to change, when in reality, it is the advance sensors detecting the approaching vehicle.

Furthermore, the article highlights that not all intersections are equipped with strobe-detecting sensors, so flashing the high beams at traffic signals that don't have these sensors will have no effect. Even when drivers encounter strobe-enabled signals, the sensors are set to detect a rapid rate of flashing that a human operating a manual headlight switch cannot imitate. Some traffic pre-emption systems now require a specific pattern of flashing to activate.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that flashing your car's high beams at a traffic signal will cause it to change from red to green more quickly. It explains that the perceived results are often coincidences, and the belief is based on a fallacy. Additionally, not all intersections have the necessary sensors, and the flashing pattern required is not achievable manually.

534,"### Context: A study conducted by researchers at Case Western Reserve University suggests that treating gum disease may reduce symptoms of prostate inflammation. The study found that men who received treatment for gum disease experienced improved symptoms of prostatitis, as well as a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. However, the article points out that the reductions in PSA levels were not statistically significant and that in participants with low levels of inflammation, the mean PSA level actually increased. The article also notes that the study had limitations, including a small sample size and the lack of a control group.

The release of the study suggests that treating periodontal disease could be a necessary approach to reducing prostate inflammation and possibly prostate cancer. However, the article argues that the release should have included information about the social and financial costs of untreated gum disease and prostatitis, as well as the costs of providing dental care to a substantial percentage of the population. It also mentions that dental care is expensive in the United States and insurance coverage is often limited.

The article criticizes the release for not providing quantitative data from the study and for making misleading claims about the reduction in PSA levels. It also suggests that the release should have mentioned the potential harm from untreated gum or prostate disease, as well as the risks and limitations of repeated PSA screening and biopsies. However, it acknowledges that the release does point out the risk to heart patients and pregnant women of untreated periodontal disease.

The article notes that the study does not provide information about how gingivitis was treated, which could have affected the results. It also criticizes the study's title for not reflecting the uncertainty of its findings. However, it concludes that the release does a good job of noting that this is not the first time a link has been suggested between gum and prostate disease.

Overall, the article suggests that while the study provides some evidence for a relationship between gum and prostate disease, the release of the study miscommunicates the findings and fails to provide important context and limitations.
Claim: Treating gum disease reduces prostate symptoms, CWRU researchers find
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This news release from Case Western Reserve University sets out to describe a relatively small study designed to further previous evidence for an observed link between gum disease and prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate). The study focuses on the likely common denominator of a body-wide biological process that releases inflammatory cytokines into blood and tissue, along with other possibilities; and on the clear possibility that non-surgical dental treatment will help. The study report in the journal Dentistry goes to some lengths to caution readers about the very shaky nature of this evidence and the fact that the study was not designed to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between periodontitis (the fancy name for inflammatory gum disease) and high PSA levels in the blood of men with prostatitis symptoms. The study authors also lay out several caveats and limitations of their study, including the small number of participants and lack of a control group. Alas, the release fails to exercise that same wise caution. It misleadingly refers to PSA reductions that were not statistically significant, and states flatly that “Treating gum disease reduced symptoms of prostate inflammation.” This overstates the value of the evidence presented in the study. Both periodontal disease and prostate disease (inflammation, tissue and tooth loss, and cancer) are widespread and have serious health consequences. Indeed, as the release and study point out, the suspected inflammatory process involved in both has also been linked to some forms of heart disease and autoimmune forms of arthritis. As a result, promoting dental care for gum disease as a means of reducing PSA levels and prostatitis (potential precursor signs of prostate cancer) poses a tantalizing means of controlling real health problems. Promoting evidence that supports the value of dental therapy in this context, however, should be accompanied by caution about the well-known debates over the meaning of high or low  PSA levels (especially in younger men and with only a single PSA test); and caution as well about the limitations of self-reported symptoms of prostatitis in a study with no control group. The authors of the study provide important context on these issues; we wish the news release had followed that lead.","Treating gum disease reduces prostate symptoms, CWRU researchers find","This news release from Case Western Reserve University reports on a small study that found treating gum disease in men with prostatitis led to reduced symptoms and lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

535,"### Context: A Facebook post claiming that the Trump administration fired 54 scientists and cut off 77 grants at Anthony Fauci's National Institutes of Health (NIH) for not disclosing ties to Communist China is misleading. While it is true that 54 scientists were either fired or resigned as a result of an NIH investigation into scientists failing to disclose financial ties to other countries, the claim falsely links Fauci to the investigation. Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of NIH, but he is not directly involved in the investigation. The director of NIH is Francis Collins.

The NIH, which is the largest public funder of biomedical research, expressed concerns in 2018 about researchers at NIH-funded institutions failing to disclose contributions from foreign organizations, including foreign governments. The agency pledged to investigate any failures to report substantial contributions. In a recent report, NIH stated that 54 scientists have resigned or been fired, and 77 scientists have been removed from the NIH system, making them ineligible for NIH grants. The hidden funding in 93% of the cases came from Chinese institutions.

The article also mentions a prominent case involving Charles Lieber, the former chair of Harvard University's Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department. Lieber was indicted for making false statements regarding his participation in China's Thousand Talents Program. His research at the Lieber Research Group had received over $15 million in grants from NIH and the Defense Department. It is alleged that Lieber became a ""strategic scientist"" at Wuhan University of Technology in China and received significant financial support from the university.

In summary, the claim that the Trump administration fired 54 scientists and cut off 77 grants at Fauci's NIH for not disclosing ties to Communist China is misleading. While the firings and removals from the NIH system did occur, the claim falsely links Fauci to the investigation. Additionally, the grants were not cut off, but rather the scientists became ineligible for NIH grants. The investigation primarily focused on undisclosed financial ties to foreign countries, with a significant number of cases involving China.

536,"### Context: The article discusses a claim that has been circulating on Facebook regarding the number 322 and its connection to COVID-19. The claim suggests that there is something nefarious going on and that COVID-19 cases are being ""synchronized"" worldwide. The article debunks this claim by explaining that the number 322 can be found in various news headlines related to COVID-19, but this does not indicate any conspiracy. The article points out that during a global pandemic, there is an unprecedented amount of media coverage focused on COVID-19, and counting statistics are readily available through online searches. With thousands of media outlets reporting on COVID-19 cases and deaths, it is not surprising that the number 322 or any other number in the low three-digit range can be found in headlines. The article also mentions that there are numerous local and regional units of government reporting COVID-19 data, which further increases the likelihood of finding tallies that add up to 322. To support their argument, the article conducted a Google News search using different numbers in the low three-digit range along with the term ""COVID."" The search results showed that there are media reports citing various numbers in that range, indicating that the claim of synchronization is baseless. The article concludes by stating that the claim linking the number 322 to COVID-19 is ridiculous, given the volume of media reports and the number of local and regional units of government involved. The article rates the claim as false.

537,"### Context: The article discusses the efforts of consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble (P&G), The Body Shop, and Unilever, to promote the use of refillable containers for their products as a way to reduce plastic waste. P&G has started offering refill pouches for some of its Olay face-cream jars and plans to expand sales of these pouches in Europe next year. The Body Shop plans to introduce ""refill stations"" in its stores globally, allowing customers to buy reusable metal containers to fill with shower gels or creams. Unilever has announced the launch of ""refill sticks"" for its Dove line of personal care products on Loopstore.com, a website that offers durable packaging with refills delivered to consumers' doors.

However, the article highlights that the results for refillable products have been mixed so far. Many shoppers are resistant to change and prefer the convenience of single-use products. Refills are generally priced 20% to 30% less than the containers they replenish, but consumers have not embraced them. SC Johnson, the maker of Windex and Pledge, has experienced flat sales for refills and concentrates over the past decade. Unilever's previous attempts to introduce refillable options, such as 20-liter tanks in Walmart's Asda supermarkets, faced issues with leaky machines, safety concerns, and high maintenance costs.

Despite these challenges, companies are still expanding their refill offerings to address plastic waste concerns. SC Johnson is testing refill stations for cleaning products with UK retailer Waitrose and is considering expanding the project. The Body Shop responded to customer demands and is bringing back refill counters in its stores. P&G acknowledges that selling refills for beauty products like shampoo and creams is more complicated due to the importance of packaging in creating customer loyalty.

Overall, while there is consumer demand for refillable products, availability and convenience remain key factors in their adoption. Companies are investing in refill options to address sustainability concerns, but they face challenges in changing consumer behavior and preferences.

538,"### Context: Their study, published online in the American Journal of Public Health, is the first to look at suicide trends by age and business cycles, and it found that working Americans — people aged 25 to 64 — are significantly more prone to suicide in tough economic times. Researchers looked at the impact of business cycles on U.S. suicide rates from 1928 through 2007. They found a general correlation among suicide rates and major shifts in the U.S. economy. For example, suicides famously spiked during the Great Depression, surging to a record high of 22 suicides per 100,000 people in 1932, up from 18 per 100,000 in 1928. But other slowdowns also saw an increase in suicides, including the end of the New Deal (1937-1938), the Oil Crisis (1973-1975), and the Double-Dip Recession (1980-1982.) And suicide rates tended to fall during periods of plenty, such as during World War Two and the decade-long expansion from 1991 to 2001, in which the economy flourished and there were low rates of unemployment. “Knowing suicides increased during economic recessions and fell during expansions underscores the need for additional suicide prevention measures when the economy weakens,” James Mercy, acting director of CDC’s Injury Center’s Division of Violence Prevention, said in a statement. “It is an important finding for policy makers and those working to prevent suicide.”

539,"### Context: Former Vice President Dick Cheney claimed that on the issue of Syria, many allies were ready to take military action but President Obama backed off at the last minute. However, this claim is not entirely accurate. While some countries, such as France, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, initially expressed support for military intervention, their support waned over time. The United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy were among the key allies that did not support military action. In fact, the British parliament rejected a motion to back the use of force, which was a significant blow to Prime Minister David Cameron. The Arab League and the United Nations also did not endorse military action. Ultimately, President Obama decided not to pursue military action in Syria because the Syrian government agreed to weapons inspections. Therefore, Cheney's claim that ""a lot of the allies signed on"" is not supported by the facts.
Claim: On Syria, ""a lot of the allies signed on. At the last minute, Obama backed off.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Cheney said a lot of allies ""got ready to go"" on Syria and ""signed on,"" but Obama backed out. Actually, very few American allies were ""ready to go."" We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. And France’s support seemed to wane as time went on. Among the ""no"" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. In fact, the United Kingdom’s parliament offered an embarrassing rebuke to Cameron when it blocked British participation. The Arab League did not endorse the military action, nor did the United Nations. Obama has said he declined to pursue military action because Syria agreed to weapons inspections. There’s no dispute that for whatever reason, military action was not pursued in Syria.

540,"### Context: A study has shown that therapy for sleep apnea can improve the quality of life for patients. However, the news release about the study failed to mention the costs of CPAP home machines, which can be expensive and may pose a financial obstacle for many people, especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The release also did not provide any specific numbers or indicators to demonstrate how much the intervention helped. Common side effects of CPAP therapy, such as congestion and stomach bloating, were not mentioned in the release. The study itself had limitations, including being a retrospective study with no control arm, which should have been included in the release. The first author of the study had ties to industry companies that profit from the sale and upkeep of CPAP machines, which is a financial conflict of interest that should have been disclosed. The release also did not mention alternative treatments for sleep apnea, such as dental appliances, surgery, and nerve stimulation. The availability of CPAP machines was not discussed, despite being easy to find, and low-cost options were not mentioned. The main issue with the news release is that it presents the effectiveness of CPAP therapy as news, despite the fact that it has been extensively studied since the 1970s. The study authors attempted to establish the novelty of their research by highlighting the large sample size and the use of two different questionnaires, but it is unclear if this is enough to warrant a news release on a well-established treatment. The news release did not use unjustifiable or sensational language.
Claim: Study shows therapy improves quality of life in people who have sleep apnea.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine describes a large retrospective study that shows that positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy improves quality of life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. PAP therapy is often given via CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines, and has been a standard treatment for sleep apnea for several decades. The release does a good job describing the study itself, and how the authors broke down patients into subgroups that compared age and socio-economic status. But the release also left much to be desired: it didn’t describe the limitations of retrospective studies or adequately discuss the harms or costs of these machines, which can be prohibitively expensive for some patients. Most importantly, the news release did not do a good job of establishing the novelty of this study. While there was a large sample size and various measures of quality of life, it is still unclear how this study is new since the benefits of CPAP are already well known. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition in the United States (and the world). It affects about 20 million adult Americans each year, and significantly decreases quality of life due to poor sleep. Sufferers of sleep apnea report daytime symptoms as well, which can include drowsiness, moodiness, headaches, and lack of energy. However sleep apnea is also a well-studied condition, and it is already known that there are several interventions, including use of a CPAP machine, that can help improve symptoms and quality of life. It would be more newsworthy if the researchers had learned something different or new about CPAP treatment or sleep apnea, instead of re-establishing what has already been known for years. The most interesting thing from this news release was that those in lower socio-economic subgroups seemed to benefit less from PAP therapy–perhaps this is a region worth further study.",Study shows therapy improves quality of life in people who have sleep apnea.,"This news release from the University of Toronto Health Sciences promotes a study that examined the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on quality of life in 1,000 patients with sleep apnea. The release does a good job of explaining the study’s design and the impact of CPAP on sleep apnea symptoms. However, it falls short in several areas. It doesn’t mention the costs of CPAP machines, which can be expensive. It also doesn’t mention the availability of CPAP machines, which are widely available. The release also doesn’t mention any potential harms of CPAP therapy, which can be significant. The release also doesn’t mention any alternative treatments for sleep apnea, such as dental appliances, surgery, and nerve stimulation. The release also doesn’t mention the study’s limitations, which are significant. The study is a retrospective study with no control arm, which should have been included in the release.

541,"### Context: A study conducted in Canada found that low-income women who received prenatal care from midwives had lower odds of birth complications compared to those who received care from general practitioners or obstetricians. The study looked at three specific pregnancy outcomes: babies who were small for gestational age, had a low birth weight, or were delivered pre-term. The study included 57,872 women who had received medical insurance premium assistance. The news release stated that midwifery care is generally less costly than care provided by specialists in obstetrics and gynecology and general practitioners.

However, the news release did not provide absolute numbers to give readers an idea of the size of the difference in outcomes. It also did not mention the study's findings on the reduction in odds of early labor or low birth weight babies for women who used midwives. The study did not address maternal health outcomes and did not provide information on potential harms of midwifery care.

The study was based on observational data, which means that cause-and-effect conclusions cannot be drawn. The authors noted that a causal relationship between midwife care and better outcomes would need to be established through repeated observational studies with representative samples over time. However, a researcher quoted in the news release made a cause-and-effect conclusion, stating that the findings show that women who are more vulnerable benefit from the care of a midwife.

The news release did not engage in disease-mongering and mentioned that midwifery is not available in all parts of the country. It also highlighted the importance of expanding midwifery to make it available for all women, especially those who are more vulnerable and may not be aware of the services available to them.

The news release did not disclose how the study was funded, but it mentioned that the lead author had been providing consulting services to the Midwives Association of BC. Overall, the news release presented midwifery as a safe option for prenatal care, particularly for low-income women, without using unjustifiable language.
Claim: Midwifery linked to lower odds of birth complications for low-income women
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This news release touted an observational study that found low-income women in British Columbia who used midwives for prenatal care experienced fewer complications than those who used general practitioners or obstetricians. The study was published in the British Medical Journal Open. Commendably, the release used mostly cautious language, stating the study adds “new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option.” However, it did not quantify adequately the differences in the outcomes or explain the limitations of observational data. Midwifery can fill an important need for wider access to care for pregnant women. Advocates for midwives say they reduce unnecessary care, cost less, and lead to great patient satisfaction. Still, news releases should stress the need for ongoing research to assess how the use of midwives affects pregnancy outcomes. The research report describes the study’s context well, noting that at this stage in the evolution of midwifery care in Canada, a randomized trial could not be supported based on the limited evidence that midwifery care is at least as good as traditional care. Studies such as this one, while not providing a definitive answer, add to our knowledge of the safety of midwifery care and pave the way for further studies that establish its benefits and risks.",Midwifery linked to lower odds of birth complications for low-income women,"This news release from the University of British Columbia describes a study that compared the outcomes of low-income women who received prenatal care from midwives to those who received care from general practitioners or obstetricians.

542,"### Context: The article discusses a study on a new experimental drug called briakinumab for the treatment of psoriasis. The study found that briakinumab was more effective than the older treatment, methotrexate, in reducing the symptoms of psoriasis. The article provides a detailed explanation of the study's findings, including the benefits of briakinumab and the potential risks associated with its use.

The article also mentions the high costs of biologic drugs, such as briakinumab, which can range from $1,500 to $2,000 per month. It criticizes the lack of discussion on the costs of these drugs in the article, stating that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about its costs.

The article praises the article for providing a more complete explanation of the serious infections and two cancer cases seen in the briakinumab group. It also mentions that a previous trial of the drug showed some unexplained major adverse cardiac events. The article compares this to a competing WebMD story, which it believes did not provide as thorough an explanation.

The article concludes with a quote from a spokesperson from the National Psoriasis Foundation, stating that the study shows ""dramatic progress"" in the treatment of psoriasis. The article appreciates this measured and responsible message, without exaggerating the implications of the study.

However, the article criticizes the lack of disclosure in the article regarding the funding and involvement of Abbott Labs, the manufacturer of briakinumab, in the study. It states that the article did not disclose that the principal investigator of the study had financial ties to Abbott Labs, and that Abbott personnel helped write the manuscript and analyze the data. The article believes that this lack of disclosure is unsatisfactory.

The article also mentions that neither the article nor the competing WebMD story provided a broader context of other approaches to psoriasis, including non-drug therapies. It believes that the experimental nature of briakinumab was made clear in the article, but that the WebMD story did a better job of mentioning a similar drug, Stelara, which was approved by the FDA in 2009.

Overall, the article provides a summary and critique of an article discussing the effectiveness of briakinumab for the treatment of psoriasis. It highlights the benefits and risks of the drug, criticizes the lack of discussion on costs and disclosure of funding, and compares it to a competing WebMD story.
Claim: Experimental Psoriasis Drug Bests Older Treatment
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"But neither story disclosed the conflicts of interest of the principal investigator. It’s difficult sometimes for journalists to dig and find conflicts of interest in those making claims about health care interventions. But when the conflicts are disclosed and published for anyone to see, why would a news story fail to include that information in a story? And neither story discussed the costs of biolgic drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. These drugs can cost $1,500-2,000/month. We think that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about costs. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that, in its more aggressive forms, can produce a good deal of discomfort and disfigurement. Treatments to date have improved but a mainstay drug, methotrexate, is limited in its effectiveness and can have some nasty side effects. Biologic drugs such as Stelara, Humira and Enbrel are somewhat more effective but very expensive. So a story about a new drug that appears effective in very early clinical trials is important.",Experimental Psoriasis Drug Bests Older Treatment,"This was a good summary of a study on a new drug for psoriasis. It did a good job of describing the benefits and harms of the drug. It could have been improved by mentioning the costs of the drug and by making it more clear that the study was funded by the manufacturer of the drug. It also could have been improved by mentioning other approaches to psoriasis, including non-drug therapies. The competing WebMD story did a better job of mentioning a similar drug, Stelara, which was approved by the FDA in 2009."
543,"### Context: The claim that teenage boys widely purchased and used the Jiftip, a urethra-covering adhesive band, in 2017 and 2018 is not supported by evidence. The Jiftip is a product designed to offer men an alternative to condoms during sex. It was registered as a trademark in the United States in 2016 by Sumina Global Limited. The company's marketing director, Momo Sumina, applied for a patent for the device in 2014 and again in 2016. The patent application describes the device as a barrier layer made of flexible material with an adhesive layer that attaches to the glans of the penis to block fluid from exiting the urethra opening. However, as of June 2018, the patent application had not been granted.

The Jiftip website features a shopping cart where users can purchase the adhesive strips. However, there is no evidence beyond the website itself that anyone has actually bought the product. The website now includes disclaimers about the safety of using Jiftip and emphasizes that it is not a condom alternative but a sexual pleasure enhancement device. The product is not available for purchase on popular online platforms like Amazon, eBay, or Google.

Despite the novelty of the product and the attention it received in the media, there is no evidence of widespread usage. There are no Facebook or Twitter posts or photos from the public showing experimentation with the product, and no product reviews from journalists or consumer websites. The article reached out to the makers of Jiftip for sales figures and information on future marketing plans but did not receive a response.

In conclusion, the claim that teenage boys widely purchased and used the Jiftip adhesive band in 2017 and 2018 is not supported by evidence. While the product exists and is available for purchase on the Jiftip website, there is no indication that it has gained significant popularity or that teenagers are specifically opting for it.

544,"### Context: The article addresses the claim that the Trump administration under-prepared the United States to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and that his budget cuts had hindered federal health agencies. It is true that Trump's fiscal year 2021 budget proposal includes a funding cut to the CDC, but this budget has not been enacted yet. The proposed funding cuts target the CDC's chronic disease activities, with the aim of focusing on preventing and controlling infectious diseases and emerging public health issues like opioid abuse. The budget also reduces overall funding for global health but allocates an extra $50 million for global health security measures. However, international HIV/AIDS programs are being cut by about $58 million.

It is important to note that this is not the first time the Trump administration has proposed cuts to the CDC budget, but such proposals do not always result in actual funding cuts. Congress has consistently overruled these proposals due to strong bipartisan support for agencies like the CDC and NIH, resulting in increased financing. The initial funding used by the CDC to combat the coronavirus outbreak came from a congressional fund created for health emergencies.

While the article acknowledges the budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration, it also highlights that a bigger concern is the decline of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness. This decline was initiated by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump.

In summary, the claim that President Trump cut funding for the CDC is partially true. While his budget proposal includes funding cuts, it has not been enacted yet, and previous proposals for cuts have been overruled by Congress. The article also emphasizes that the erosion of a CDC grant program for public health emergency preparedness is a more significant concern, and this decline was not solely caused by the Trump administration but also by a congressional budget measure.
Claim: U.S. President Donald Trump cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:

545,"### Context: The article discusses conservative radio host Glenn Beck's claim that every time someone new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. The article explains that while it is true that the Ebola virus mutates, not every mutation makes the virus more deadly or difficult to treat. Most mutations actually reduce the fitness of the virus and are lost from the population. The article also explains that the Ebola virus largely works through the proteins it produces, and most mutations result in proteins that do not help the virus infect more parts of the body. 

The article cites infectious disease researchers who confirm that the virus does mutate, but they emphasize that not every mutation has a significant impact on the virus. They explain that most mutations do not change the protein sequence, which is what determines how the virus works. The researchers also mention a study that found 40 mutations in the Ebola virus, but only a third of them were non-synonymous mutations that could potentially change the proteins in the virus. Of those non-synonymous mutations, it is unclear whether they actually made the virus more successful or able to spread to new individuals.

The article also mentions that even if mutations occur in a victim's bloodstream, they may not be passed on to others. The researchers found instances where mutations appeared but did not result in transmissions, suggesting that the mutations died off.

Overall, the article concludes that while it is true that the Ebola virus mutates, not every mutation is significant or leads to a more dangerous form of the virus. The claim made by Glenn Beck that every time someone new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates is partially accurate but leaves out important details.
Claim: Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Beck warned that every time someone new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. First, mutation and replication go hand in hand and infecting a new person doesn’t change that. But the much larger point is that Beck is painting mutations with a broad brush. Most of them hurt the virus and are automatic dead-ends. Of those that don’t actually hurt it, about two-thirds don’t change how Ebola functions. Of those that change how the virus functions, there’s no data to say whether the functional changes matter. However, the most recent study in West Africa found that many new varieties are not passed on to new victims. Beck’s statement about Ebola mutations is partially accurate but leaves out important details.","Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates.","Beck said, """"Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates."""" It’s true that the Ebola virus mutates, but not every mutation is significant. Beck’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details."
546,"### Context: The article discusses a new cancer treatment called the NanoKnife and raises questions about its effectiveness and lack of scientific evidence. The machine costs around $300,000, but Medicare does not specifically cover its use. Some private insurers, like Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield, also decline to cover it due to the lack of scientific evidence of its effectiveness in improving health outcomes.

The article mentions that the NanoKnife has some reported side effects, such as triggering fast heartbeats and the possibility of puncturing an artery during the operation. However, the company behind the NanoKnife claims that these side effects have been treatable and that they have taken steps to minimize future occurrences.

The story highlights the lack of evidence for the benefits of the NanoKnife due to the limited number of human patients it has been tested on. It questions why the company thinks the results are promising and does not provide a comparison with other traditional surgical approaches for treating cancer.

The article quotes several outside experts, including Riad Salem, chief of interventional oncology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Ken Thomson, a radiologist in Australia who studied the devices, and Tim Clark, director of interventional radiology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. These experts provide their opinions on the NanoKnife and its claims.

The story also distinguishes between the claims made by the company and the claims made by the clinics and hospitals that have purchased the machines. The CEO of the machine manufacturer states that they are not part of the PR machine and are not happy about it.

The NanoKnife is currently being used in about 13 U.S. hospitals and has been used to treat around 300 cancer patients worldwide. The article mentions that similar devices have been used for other procedures, but the NanoKnife is a relatively new therapy for cancer.

Overall, the article raises concerns about the lack of evidence for the NanoKnife's effectiveness and the limited coverage by Medicare and private insurers. It also highlights the reported side effects and the need for more comparative data with traditional surgical approaches.
Claim: Some Doctors Question New Cancer Treatment
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story shows how ""a shortcut the Food and Drug Administration allows for granting regulatory approval to certain medical devices"" has allowed the NanoKnife, an experimental treatment with very limited evidence, to be touted as the latest cure for cancer. The story hits nearly all of our marks, although we wish there were more detail in areas such as costs, potential benefits, and the overall evaluation of the evidence. This device is the type one might see advertised on the side of a bus or in the back pages of of a weekly tabloid. Health reporters often ignore these claims to focus on the higher profile blockbuster drugs being sold by major drug companies or some breakthrough discovery in a major scientific journal. The promotion and use of these under-researched devices can have devastating consquences for patients. In addition, one of the major drivers of increasing health care costs is the introduction of new technologies. While additional costs may be justified if there is an improvement in patient outcomes associated with the new technology, newer is not always better. The NanoKnife is the latest in a series of new devices, approved by the FDA, that have yet to demonstrate a substantive improvement in patient outcomes.

547,"### Context: While it probably can be assumed that the zinc-containing products discussed in the story are relatively inexpensive, the story contained no direct discussion of costs. Readers would have benefited from this information, for example, when evaluating the value of zinc-based cold remedies. The story mentions that zinc lozenges ""may help and probably won’t hurt"" when it comes to colds, but how much will the reader have to pay for a shot at this benefit? Readers’ perceptions would no doubt differ if the product costs $2 vs. $20. The sidebar to this story notes that zinc lozenges have been tested in patients with colds or the flu in 14 studies over 25 years. It noted that benefits were seen in about half of the studies, but no benefits and potential harms were observed in other studies. It quantified the benefits found in one study, where colds, coughs and runny noses were of shorter duration in the zinc group compared with the group that received a placebo lozenge. While it would have been nice to see a description of the studies that found no benefit and/or harm (Were they more or less rigorous than the studies reporting benefits? ), the story does enough to fulfill this criterion.
Claim: Zinc may ward off viruses but there are dangers
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story and its sidebar raise important concerns about the potentially toxic effects of too much zinc, but provides insufficient detail to allow consumers to accurately gauge the risks. It fails to discuss the limitations of animal studies and a small case series suggesting neurological impairment from excessive zinc, and makes vague references to studies suggesting links between zinc and health problems. Finally, in a story whose main point was to discuss the harm that can result from too much zinc, it was strange to see no mention of a strongly worded FDA advisory warning consumers not to take the zinc-based nasal spray Zicam. We often hear the claim that we consume too little or too much of certain foods and nutrients, and that changing our habits may lead to better health. Good reporting can help consumers focus on changes that are most likely to be beneficial. Articles such as this pointing out potential for harm are also critically important for consumers.",Zinc may ward off viruses but there are dangers,"This story discusses the use of zinc-containing products to prevent and treat colds.

548,"### Context: An FDA advisory panel has recommended the approval of Exelon (rivastigmine), a drug developed by Novartis, for the treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. The panel believes the drug to be safe, but the article does not mention any side effects or harms of rivastigmine. The story does not provide any cost information for the drug, nor does it quantify any benefits or describe what improvements might be expected. The article also does not mention any evidence for the therapeutic claims of rivastigmine for treating Parkinson's disease.

The FDA panel's recommendation for approval is based solely on studies conducted by the manufacturer, which raises concerns about the lack of independent input. While rivastigmine may provide some improvement in dementia symptoms among some people with certain forms of Alzheimer's disease, it is not known whether long-term outcomes, such as nursing home admission, are improved with the drug. It is also unclear whether the drug would have the same effects in a different population, such as those with Parkinson's disease, and if so, whether those effects would be meaningful.

The article does not engage in disease mongering and provides simple descriptions of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, more information about these conditions could have been useful. The story also fails to mention other treatment options, such as memantine.

While the FDA usually follows the advice of the advisory panel, there is no discussion of when the FDA might approve the drug for this indication. The article does mention that Exelon is currently on the market for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, indicating that the drug is not new but is being considered for a new purpose.

Overall, the article lacks important information about the cost, benefits, and potential side effects of rivastigmine. It also does not provide independent input on the therapeutic claims of the drug or mention other treatment options. The lack of information about the FDA's next steps and potential approval timeline is also a notable omission.
Claim: FDA Panel Backs Novartis Drug For Treating Parkinson’s Dementia
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story reports that an FDA advisory panel recommended an existing drug (rivastigmine) be approved for a new use – the treatment of dementia in people with Parkinson’s disease. The story adequately tells readers that the drug is not new, but is being considered for a new purpose. It doesn’t seem to exaggerate the condition (although more info might have been useful). However, several other areas could be improved, including discussion of costs, side effects, benefits, a description of the evidence upon which claims are based, and other treatment options. It would be a concern if this story leaves readers thinking there may be a good treatment option for Parkinson’s dementia that’s about to become available, when this may not be the case. It isn’t clear that this treatment even works in Parkinson’s, and if it does work, that any benefits are meaningful either in the short-run or long-run.",FDA Panel Backs Novartis Drug For Treating Parkinson’s Dementia,"This story reports on an FDA panel’s recommendation to approve the drug Exelon (rivastigmine) for the treatment of dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease. The story does not mention any side effects or harms of rivastigmine. The story does not provide any cost information for the drug, nor does it quantify any benefits or describe what improvements might be expected. The story also does not mention any evidence for the therapeutic claims of rivastigmine for treating Parkinson’s disease. The FDA panel’s recommendation for approval is based solely on studies conducted by the manufacturer, which raises concerns about the lack of independent input. While rivastigmine may provide some improvement in dementia symptoms among some people with certain forms of Alzheimer’s disease, it is not known whether long-term outcomes, such as nursing home admission, are improved with the drug. It is also unclear whether the drug would have the same effects in a different population, such as those with Parkinson’s disease, and if so, whether those effects would be meaningful."
549,"### Context: A recent study has found that a cannabis derivative called cannabidiol (CBD) can significantly reduce seizures in patients with a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. The study was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which is considered the highest standard of evidence. The results showed that seizure frequency dropped by 39% in the CBD-treated group, with three patients experiencing a complete cessation of seizures. In comparison, the placebo group saw a 13% reduction in seizures. The difference in seizure reduction between the two groups was both statistically significant and clinically consistent.

The study also noted the side effects of CBD use, with 93.4% of patients in the CBD group experiencing side effects compared to 74.6% in the placebo group. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue, and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects, while only one participant from the placebo group withdrew.

The study was funded by GW Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Epidiolex, the CBD drug used in the trial. The trial involved adding Epidiolex to the patients' existing treatment over a 14-week period, indicating that other treatments are available but CBD is an add-on treatment, not an alternative.

It is important to note that Epidiolex has not been approved by the FDA yet, but the FDA considers cannabidiol an investigational product for treating children with epilepsy and has provisions for expanded access that allow its use.

The release of the study results coincides with their publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. The release emphasizes that while CBD shows promise as a treatment option for severe forms of epilepsy, it should not be viewed as a panacea. The lead researcher states that for patients who have not responded to numerous medications, CBD provides hope for another treatment option.

Overall, the study provides evidence that CBD can reduce seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, but further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and potential long-term effects.
Claim: Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This release from the NYU Langone Medical Center describes a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of children and adolescents with Dravet syndome, an extreme form of epilepsy, who often don’t respond to other drugs. The release provides a very good description of the benefits and the side effects that were reported from the trial. It adds cautions and nuance that are missing from many news releases. But not included were the cost of the new drug (projected to be quite steep) and we think the release could have emphasized more that the children in the trial were already on seizure medications. When the cannabidiol (or a placebo) was added to the maintenance drug it alleviated seizures but also introduced a high degree of side effects. A CNN story on the study, which we also reviewed, had many of the same strengths as the news release (overall depth and detail on benefits), but it similarly skipped cost information. Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy that generally begins in a child’s first year but is a life-long condition, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Currently, treatments for this condition are marginal and new therapies addressing its symptoms would be welcome. The trial showed reduced seizures in this difficult-to-treat type of epilepsy compared to patients given a placebo. The lead researcher stressed that the study only tested cannabidiol in patients “with especially severe forms who have not responded to numerous medications”  and that the drug is not a panacea for other forms of epilepsy.",Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder,"This news release describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a drug called cannabidiol (CBD) for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare and severe form of epilepsy. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The release does a good job of describing the study and its results, and of explaining the potential harms of the drug. It would have been stronger if it had mentioned the cost of the drug, which is not yet available, and if it had been more clear about the fact that the study was funded by the drug’s manufacturer. Dravet syndrome is a rare and severe form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. It is characterized by frequent seizures, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment. The seizures are resistant to treatment with currently available medications. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes a potassium channel in the brain. The mutation results in the channel being more open than it should be, which can lead to seizures. The drug cannabidiol (CBD) is a derivative of cannabis that is being studied for its potential to treat seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome. The drug is not yet available, but it is being developed by GW Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Epidiolex."
550,"### Context: The article discusses the effectiveness of the experimental drug Tykerb (generic name lapatinib) in the treatment of metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer. The drug manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, claims that Tykerb has shown promising results in a trial of metastatic breast cancer patients. The addition of lapatinib to chemotherapy resulted in cancers remaining stable for nearly twice as long compared to chemotherapy alone (8.5 months vs. 4.5 months). There were also fewer incidents of cancer spreading to the brain in patients who took lapatinib and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (4 vs. 11 cases). The article notes that survival data or data on quality of life would be helpful to support these claims.

The article mentions that lapatinib has shown less serious cardiac side effects compared to Herceptin, another treatment for HER-2 positive breast cancer. However, the comparison with Herceptin is not fair as there is not enough information on the length of time patients took lapatinib and Herceptin to make a statistically significant comparison. The article also highlights that long-term cardiac problems are less of an issue for metastatic patients, but it could be a concern for early-stage breast cancer patients, for whom lapatinib is being tested as an alternative to Herceptin.

The article acknowledges that the trial for lapatinib was conducted in only 392 patients and was not a head-to-head comparison with Herceptin. It also mentions that the sources cited in the article are associated with GlaxoSmithKline, the sponsor of the study. The article suggests that additional perspectives from independent oncology researchers would be beneficial.

The article mentions that lapatinib is still being tested in clinical trials and is not yet available for sale. GlaxoSmithKline plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the US and Europe by the end of the year. The article notes that the company has high hopes for Tykerb.

Overall, the article provides information on the effectiveness of lapatinib in metastatic breast cancer patients but highlights the need for more data on survival and quality of life. It also raises concerns about the comparison with Herceptin and the potential cardiac side effects of lapatinib. The article suggests that additional perspectives from independent researchers would provide a more balanced view.
Claim: Glaxo Touts Experimental Tykerb As Effective Breast-Cancer Treament
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The story discusses the preliminary results of lapatinib (trade name Tykerb) and chemotherapy in HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients. Patients who took lapatinib and the chemotherapy drug Xeloda remained stable (i.e. cancer did not spread further) nearly twice as long as patients who only had chemotherapy (8.5 months vs. 4.5 months). However, many drugs are effective in prolonging response in metastatic disease without impacting length of life. It would be good to get survival data to back up these claims, or at least provide data on quality of life to see whether the addition of lapatinib made a difference and how much. Additionally, the results of this trial have not been scrutinized in a peer-reviewed medical journal. The story provides a powerful, but premature suggestion of equivalence between Herceptin and lapatinib. The suggeston is not evidenced based, as the two drugs have not been compared in a controlled trial. Potential cardiac side effects are a big issue for early-stage breast cancer patients, the group of women for whom this drug is already being tested as an alternative to Herceptin, so further research comparing the two drugs is needed. This story relies solely on sources associated with the drug manufacturer. It also appears to rely heavily on information from a press release by the study sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline. Other oncology researchers are needed for perspective on the results of lapatinib as part of treatment for HER-2 positive cancer. The story mentions that lapatinib is still being tested in clinical trials and is not yet available for sale. The story says that “GlaxoSmithKline plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe by the end of this year,” and later mentions Glaxo’s “high hopes for Tykerb.” It would have been better to get some other perspectives about these prospects, other than comments from the company or company-sponsored researchers.",Glaxo Touts Experimental Tykerb As Effective Breast-Cancer Treament,"This story reports on the results of a recent study on the experimental drug lapatinib (marketed as Tykerb) for the treatment of metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer.

551,"### Context: The article discusses the new breast cancer screening guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and how they conflict with congressional action mandating insurance coverage for mammography screening. The article points out that while the USPSTF recommendations are aimed at women with an average risk of breast cancer, there are other factors that can place women at elevated risk, such as a history of prior breast surgery or certain genetic mutations. The article also mentions that there are varying estimates of the cost of a mammogram, with one paper from 2011 stating that the overall cost is $266. However, the article does not provide a clear answer on how much a mammogram would cost if it were not covered by insurance. 

The article notes that the USPSTF recommendations state that screening mammography has the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74, but it does not provide specific information on the potential benefits for different age groups. The article also briefly mentions the potential harms of over-diagnosis and false positives, but does not explain these terms or provide information on how serious these harms are or how common they are. 

The article does mention that women should be informed consumers and have the authority to weigh the potential benefits against the potential harms of mammography screening. It also discusses the recommendations from other organizations, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society, which have differing recommendations from the USPSTF. The article explains that mammograms have been used as breast cancer screening tools for a long time and discusses insurance coverage issues related to mammography screening. 

Overall, the article provides some information on the USPSTF recommendations and their implications, but it lacks specific details on the cost of mammograms without insurance coverage, the potential benefits for different age groups, and the seriousness and frequency of potential harms.
Claim: New breast cancer screening guidelines at odds with Congress
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The story provides a good overview of new recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on when, and how often, women should receive mammograms to screen for breast cancer. The story summarizes the long-running debate over mammogram recommendations, particularly congressional action on the issue. The story also discusses the differing advice that various organizations provide on when women at average risk of breast cancer should begin mammogram screening, though the story would have been stronger if it had more fully explored both the benefits and potential harms associated with women starting mammogram screening early or having the tests more often (something that a competing New York Times story on the recommendations does well). The story also offers a good discussion of issues related to what the USPSTF recommendations may mean for insurance coverage of mammograms, though it does not tell readers how expensive mammograms may be without insurance. Breast cancer screening is a big deal. As the CDC notes, “Not counting some kinds of skin cancer, breast cancer in the United States is the most common cancer in women, no matter your race or ethnicity.” In 2012 alone, 41,150 women died of the disease. Breast cancer also has a profound impact on the economy, with researchers estimating that it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year. In other words, it affects the health and well-being of millions of patients and their loved ones, as well as having an adverse impact on the economy. News that relates to the early detection and treatment of breast cancer is clearly news worth covering, particularly when it could inform the decision-making of women and health professionals — and have an effect on women’s access to screening.",New breast cancer screening guidelines at odds with Congress,"The story does a good job of explaining the recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and how they differ from the recommendations of other groups. The story also does a good job of explaining the congressional action that mandated insurance coverage for mammography screening. The story could have been improved by providing more detail on the cost of a mammogram without insurance coverage, and by providing more detail on the potential benefits and harms of mammography. The story also could have been improved by providing more detail on the evidence that the USPSTF used to make their recommendations."
552,"### Context: The article discusses a study that found that estrogen may lower the risk of breast cancer and heart attacks in certain women. The study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed as Premarin. However, the article notes that this form of estrogen is not commonly used anymore, so the benefits may not apply to the current form of estrogen, estradiol.

The article highlights the importance of considering different risks associated with hormone replacement therapy. It mentions that estrogen alone carries different risks than estrogen combined with progestin, and that the risks for women with a uterus are different from those who have had a hysterectomy.

The article also mentions that the study's findings of decreased breast cancer risk with estrogen contradict the results of many other studies that have shown an increased risk. It acknowledges that the margin of benefit, if it exists, would be small, with only 8 fewer cases of breast cancer per 10,000 women per year.

The article includes interviews with different sources holding different perspectives, providing a balanced view on the topic. It emphasizes the need to differentiate between different types of hormone replacement therapy and not generalize the benefits or risks.

Overall, the article does not touch on the costs associated with estrogen therapy. It provides some quantifiers for the benefits of estrogen in reducing heart attacks but does not provide a similar quantifier for the headline claim of estrogen lowering breast cancer risk. The article is praised for parsing risk carefully and explaining the nuances to readers. It also mentions that the article does not make any inappropriate claims about estrogen and includes independent reporting.
Claim: Estrogen Lowers Breast Cancer and Heart Attack Risk in Some
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The New York Times provides vital context for this discussion of estrogen use after menopause. Kudos for the  parsing of risk and including skepticism about the value of these results from outside researchers. Millions of women have already taken hormone replacement, and more are poised in the delicate transition where such therapy may be considered. The medical confusion is tricky for them, and this story will be widely read. Giving a true picture of this confusion is vital to helping women maneuver among unknowns.",Estrogen Lowers Breast Cancer and Heart Attack Risk in Some,"This is a story about a study that found that estrogen alone may lower the risk of breast cancer and heart attacks in certain women. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s findings, and does a particularly good job of explaining the nuances of the study’s findings. The story also does a good job of explaining that the study’s findings are not generalizable to other forms of hormone replacement therapy. The story would have been stronger if it had included a discussion of costs, and if it had included a quantifier for the headline claim that estrogen “lowers” breast cancer risk."
553,"### Context: The claim that Italy discovered that COVID-19 is a bacterium and not a virus is false. COVID-19 is caused by the virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Bacteria and viruses are biologically different, with bacteria being living organisms that can replicate without a host cell, while viruses require a host to replicate. Genetic analysis of COVID-19 has shown that it is a virus and not a bacterium.

There is some evidence of blood-clotting problems in severe cases of COVID-19, but these are most likely caused by lung complications. Studies have found a connection between severe COVID-19 and blood clots in the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This is likely due to the development of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, which impairs breathing and oxygen saturation.

The claim that Italy went against the World Health Organization's guidelines and performed an ""illegal"" autopsy on COVID-19 patients is also inaccurate. The World Health Organization has not discouraged autopsies of patients who died from COVID-19 and has actually released guidance on how to perform such autopsies safely. Autopsies have been conducted on COVID-19 patients in various countries, including the first English-language autopsy report published in April.

In summary, the claim that Italy discovered that COVID-19 is a bacterium, that it clots the blood and reduces oxygen saturation, and that Italy went against the World Health Organization's guidelines on autopsies is false. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, blood-clotting issues are likely due to lung complications, and the World Health Organization has not discouraged autopsies on COVID-19 patients.
Claim: Italy “went against the WHO's ‘law’” against COVID-19 autopsies and “discovered covid is not a virus, but a bacterium” that “clots the blood and reduces the oxygen saturation.”

In April 2016, a viral Facebook post claimed that if new moms contacted their local Chic-fil-A close to their due date or after giving birth, they would receive a free meal. However, this promotion is not available at all Chic-fil-A locations. In the past, in-store promotions at Chic-fil-A have caused confusion, such as the widely reported ""missing man table"" set to honor combat veterans, which was only implemented in certain restaurants in the Atlanta market. Similarly, the free meal for new moms claim is not a companywide policy. While there is no definitive list of Chic-fil-A locations that offer free meals for new moms, a Houston-based mom blog confirmed that some restaurants in the area were offering the promotion as of January 2015. These restaurants provided a small nugget tray, fruit tray, a gallon of sweet tea, and a gift for the baby as part of the New Mommy Meal. Additionally, the free meal for new moms may have been confused with Chic-fil-A's ""Mom Valet"" or ""Mommy VIP Service,"" which allows parents to place an order at the drive-thru window and have a table set up inside for their family.

555,"### Context: The article discusses the differences in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy and South Korea. Italy initially tested widely but later narrowed the focus to only testing people with symptoms, while South Korea has been testing hundreds of thousands of people and using technology to track potential carriers. South Korea has reported fewer deaths and cases compared to Italy, suggesting that aggressive and sustained testing is effective in fighting the virus. However, South Korea's approach comes at the cost of privacy, as it relies on accessing personal data such as CCTV footage, GPS tracking, and credit card transactions. Italy's healthcare system, which is generally efficient, has been overwhelmed by the outbreak, with hospitals facing a shortage of staff and resources. The country has had to delay non-urgent operations and is struggling to provide adequate care for both COVID-19 patients and those with other contagious diseases. Intensive care facilities are under intense pressure, and the government is working to increase the number of beds and acquire more equipment. In South Korea, the largest outbreak was linked to a secretive church, and the government responded by setting up drive-through testing facilities and using location data to notify residents of nearby cases. The country has a capacity to conduct thousands of tests per day and has a network of quarantine officers who track potential carriers and their contacts. However, South Korea still faces challenges in maintaining a trained workforce and up-to-date infrastructure at smaller hospitals. Overall, the article highlights the importance of widespread testing and effective tracking measures in controlling the spread of the virus.

556,"### Context: According to a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Inspector General, state and federal regulators failed to provide accurate information about public health risks during Hurricane Harvey in Houston. The report states that regulators lacked sufficient data to make such determinations, yet assured residents that there were no health risks. The report also found that air-quality sampling conducted by the EPA using a mobile laboratory and a sensor-equipped plane was not useful in assessing health risks. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), the state's environmental regulator, declined to share data or discuss their decision-making during Harvey. The report highlights that the EPA collected inadequate data after the hurricane while screening for elevated air contamination. The data collected was insufficient to accurately assess airborne toxin concentrations for health-based assessments. The report supports previous findings by The Associated Press and Houston Chronicle, which revealed a more widespread toxic impact than authorities publicly reported after the storm. The hurricane caused the release of industrial toxic substances, including known human carcinogens, into surrounding neighborhoods and waterways. Most toxic emissions were due to tank failures at industrial plants and facilities shutting down and restarting. However, the monitoring efforts after restarting did not always generate suitable data for health-based assessments. In response to the inadequate state and EPA response, the Environmental Defense Fund conducted independent air-quality testing in east Houston, an area heavily impacted by the petrochemical industry. The report also mentions that NASA scientists were turned away by the EPA and TCEQ when they offered to monitor pollution levels after the hurricane. The report comes after a year of high-profile explosions and fires at refineries along the Texas coast. The latest incident was a chemical fire at the TPC Group plant, which led to mandatory evacuation orders for over 50,000 people. Local officials claimed that elevated levels of butadiene, a chemical used in synthetic rubber production, did not pose a serious health risk.

557,"### Context: The article analyzes a claim made by the Republican Governors Association (RGA) against Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida. The claim states that Sink, as bank president, eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses.

Regarding the job losses, the article states that there is consistent news coverage from the time reporting that NationsBank, where Sink was a top executive, planned to eliminate 6,000 jobs as a result of a merger with Barnett Bank. While the final number of job losses may have been higher or lower, the RGA ad's claim of ""thousands of Florida jobs"" is accurate.

In terms of compensation, the article mentions that Sink's tax returns from 1999 to 2001, released during her husband's gubernatorial campaign, showed she earned over $8 million during that period. However, it is worth noting that this income was earned between two and four years after the merger was announced. The ad's use of the term ""salary and bonuses"" is slightly inaccurate as Sink's income included stock options, lump-sum pension payments, and deferred compensation, but it is unclear if she received traditional bonuses.

The article also explores the larger context of the claim. Banking experts noted that Sink's actions were not unusual compared to other bank executives during a period of aggressive mergers. The job losses were a normal part of the merger process to improve efficiency and eliminate redundant positions. Blaming Sink personally for the job losses is deemed preposterous by the experts.

Lastly, the article addresses the responsibility of Sink in the decision to merge and the job losses. Sink stated that the decision was made by corporate executives at NationsBank headquarters, and she was responsible for implementing the merger. The RGA argues that Sink, as the bank's president, was responsible for the decisions made.

Overall, the article concludes that the RGA ad is generally accurate, except for the use of the term ""bonus"" in Sink's compensation. The job losses and the amount of Sink's income are supported by evidence, and the blame for the job losses is deemed unfair by banking experts.

558,"### Context: A jury in Humboldt County Superior Court in Eureka, California has rejected claims by Carla Allen that her mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, was caused by Johnson & Johnson's talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder. Johnson & Johnson denies the allegations, stating that decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. The company faces around 11,700 talc lawsuits in the United States, with over 9,700 of those cases involving claims over ovarian cancer. The remaining plaintiffs allege that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson's talc caused them to develop mesothelioma.

Johnson & Johnson expressed satisfaction with the jury's decision in the case of Allen, stating that the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by the use of their talcum-based products. The details of the jury's decision were not immediately available.

Johnson & Johnson has been facing talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation has recently expanded to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim that asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Johnson & Johnson has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases, but has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, resulting in a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are currently under appeal. Four additional mesothelioma cases ended in a mistrial due to jurors being unable to reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died.

In July, a Missouri jury awarded a massive $4.69 billion verdict against Johnson & Johnson in the first trial alleging that asbestos contamination caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. This decision is also under appeal.

559,"### Context: The claim that the Girl Scouts USA's curriculum promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for children to emulate is not supported by the evidence. The American Life League, a Catholic pro-life organization, made this claim in an email blast signed by Judie Brown, the organization's president. The league credited a former Girl Scouts troop leader, Christy Volanski, with the research behind the claim.

The article examines the promotion of Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan by the Girl Scouts. It states that the promotion of Sanger is not directly in the scouts' curriculum but occurs via social media. The article provides a link to a Pinterest page for Girl Scout Cadettes, which includes a blog post highlighting speeches by women, including Sanger. The blog post describes Sanger's campaign for women's rights to birth control in the 1920s but does not mention abortion.

Regarding Betty Friedan, the article states that she is mentioned in the Girl Scouts' curriculum as one of the exemplary women in a guide for older scouts interested in learning about advocacy. The guide mentions Friedan's book ""The Feminine Mystique"" and her involvement in starting the National Organization for Women (NOW), but it does not touch on abortion or her involvement in abortion rights.

The article also mentions that other women described in the Girl Scouts' curriculum include prominent figures in the Democratic Party, some of whom have championed abortion rights. However, the article states that there are no mentions of abortion or birth control in the 103-page guide.

The Girl Scouts of the USA state on their website that they do not take a position on abortion or birth control and believe it is a private matter for girls and their families. The organization's spokesperson, Kelly Parisi, states that the scouts' curriculum does not depict Sanger, Friedan, and other women as pro-abortion icons.

In conclusion, the evidence does not support the claim that the Girl Scouts USA's curriculum promotes Margaret Sanger, Betty Friedan, and other pro-abortion women as icons for children to emulate. The promotion of Sanger occurs via social media, and the mention of Friedan in the curriculum does not touch on abortion or her involvement in abortion rights. The Girl Scouts of the USA maintain a nonpartisan and nonpolitical stance on abortion and birth control.

### Explanation:
",false,"The league said Girl Scouts USA’s curriculum ""promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate."" A Girl Scouts’ Pinterest page--not the scouts’ curriculum--leads to a blog post highlighting speeches by 13 women, including one by Sanger. The scouts' advocacy guide, part of the organization’s curriculum, features two blurbs on Friedan and also thumbnails other women who have advocated abortion rights. However, none of the guide's 50-some biographical blurbs mentions any woman's activism per abortion as a reason for singling her out. Abortion is not mentioned elsewhere in the guide, either. We find no factual reason to conclude that the scouts are teaching girls in this vein.","Girl Scouts USA’s curriculum ""promotes Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, Betty Friedan, founder of NARAL Prochoice, and other pro-abortion women as icons for our children to emulate.","What's true: The Girl Scouts USA's curriculum does mention Margaret Sanger and Betty Friedan.

560,"### Context: The article accurately describes the rapes and murders of Christopher Newsom and Channon Christian. On January 6, 2007, the couple went out for a dinner date and never returned. Newsom's body was found near some railroad tracks, but Christian remained missing. Christian's abandoned vehicle was located the next day, and her body was discovered in a trash disposal bin at the residence of Lemaricus Devall ""Slim"" Davidson. The article claims that the national news media did not report on these events because the victims were white.

The details of the crime were revealed in court testimony and were horrific. Newsom was repeatedly sodomized, bound, gagged, blindfolded, shot, and set on fire. Christian was tortured, beaten, raped, had bleach poured over her body and down her throat, and was left to suffocate in a disposal bin. However, some details presented in initial press accounts were inaccurate.

Five suspects were arrested and charged with the murders. Davidson, along with his brother Cobbins and Thomas, were indicted on multiple counts, including murder, robbery, kidnapping, and rape. Coleman was also indicted on multiple counts. Boyd faced federal charges as an accessory after the fact and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

Cobbins and Thomas were found guilty and received life sentences. Coleman was sentenced to 53 years in prison. Davidson was convicted and sentenced to death. The presiding judge at the original trial was later disbarred, but the original convictions were allowed to stand. Coleman was convicted a second time and re-sentenced to 35 years in prison, while Thomas was convicted a second time and given consecutive life sentences with an additional 25 years.

The article addresses the question of why the murders were not prosecuted as a hate crime. It states that there was no evidence to suggest that the race of the victims was a motivation for their killing. Police, prosecutors, and the families of the victims all believed that the murders were not a hate crime.

The article also mentions that the initial news reportage of the murders was primarily local and received little national coverage by major news outlets, which some attributed to racial bias in the media.

The story does quote two physicians, albeit with not a lot of depth. The story does not mention medications as an alternative treatment option. The story clearly states that stenting is a common procedure. The story clearly states that drug-eluting stents are not new.

562,"### Context: President Donald Trump compared the surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. to the situation in New Zealand, claiming that New Zealand had a ""big surge"" in cases. However, on the day of Trump's remark, New Zealand had reported only nine new COVID-19 cases. The previous day, it reported 13 new cases, and on the day following Trump's comment, it reported another 13 new cases. These new cases have caused alarm in New Zealand, leading to the postponement of the country's election and a lockdown in Auckland, its largest city.

Experts have criticized Trump's claim, stating that it is a stretch to say that New Zealand had ever ""beat"" the virus, considering the ongoing pandemic worldwide and the mitigation efforts in place in New Zealand to keep cases low. Comparing the situation in New Zealand to the outbreak in the U.S., where the country has been reporting over 50,000 new cases per day for most of August and July, the disparity is significant. As of August 18, New Zealand had recorded a total of 1,643 confirmed and probable cases, with 22 deaths and 90 active cases. In contrast, the U.S. has seen nearly 5.5 million cases and over 171,000 deaths.

New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, dismissed Trump's suggestion that the surge in their country was something the U.S. would not ""want,"" stating that there is no comparison between New Zealand's current cluster and the tens of thousands of cases being seen daily in the United States. Experts also emphasized the significant difference in the number of cases between the two countries, with New Zealand having only a few dozen cases in the last week compared to the U.S. reporting a few dozen new cases in just a couple of minutes.

In conclusion, Trump's claim that New Zealand had a ""big surge"" in coronavirus cases is not supported by the data. While New Zealand has seen a small increase in cases recently, it is incomparable to the ongoing outbreak in the U.S.

563,"### Context: It discusses the drug’s costs, which are expected to be substantial. Given the relatively small population that the drug might be of benefit to, price considerations are important. The story briefly notes both aspects. We liked the early caveat that VX-770 is designed for use in only 4% of people with CF, or 1200 Americans. It summarizes the alternative treatments for CF. It would’ve been interesting to note what other therapies subjects in this study received.
Claim: Trial Shows Cystic Fibrosis Drug Helped Ease Breathing
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Our main critique is the lack of any independent medical voice in this story. With the exception of an analyst, all quoted sources bet on this horse to win. Perhaps the analyst did, as well. When results are only available in a press release, it’s even more critical to get assessment from clearly independent sources. This kind of informal peer review would’ve strengthened the story’s authority substantially. This story is important for a couple of reasons. New CF treatments are needed. Desperately. The announcement of positive results for a new mode of therapy is sure to cause great excitement among patients, providers, and investors. This blog on the health care business does a solid job of describing the study from a business perspective, covering the core features of its design, results, and some interesting context, such as the drug’s 20-year journey. It takes a bit of background in research to pick up on the study’s limitations, but they’re here, too. The cystic fibrosis gene was identified in 1989 and with the identification came the hope that a the mutation could in some way be manipulated or new treatments identified. VX-770 is a step in that direction. It remains to be seen if the drug will make it to market.",Trial Shows Cystic Fibrosis Drug Helped Ease Breathing,"This is a story about a new drug for cystic fibrosis. It’s a good, solid story that does a good job of explaining the drug’s benefits, potential harms, and the design of the study. It also does a good job of putting the drug in the context of existing treatments. The story would have been stronger if it had provided more detail about the alternative treatments. It also would have been helpful to note that the drug is not a cure. It’s a treatment that will be used in conjunction with other treatments."
564,"### Context: The article titled ""Gene therapy shown to destroy leukemia tumors"" discusses a recent study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, where researchers successfully used gene therapy to destroy tumors in patients with advanced leukemia. The article highlights the potential of this treatment and mentions that two participants in the Phase I trial have been in remission for up to a year, while a third had a strong anti-tumor response.

However, the article points out that the cost of this gene therapy was not addressed in the original WebMD story. It mentions that the funding for the University of Pennsylvania's gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the research is expensive. The researchers are now seeking corporate partners as they move into Phase II trials.

The WebMD story provided more details about the potential harms of the treatment. It mentioned that patients suffered debilitating side effects and, in one case, had to be treated with steroids that may have hindered the effectiveness of the therapy. The article criticizes the WebMD story for allowing the study's authors to make overly effusive statements that overshadowed some of the more cautionary notes.

The Reuters story, on the other hand, did a better job by quoting Dr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center, who warned about the long-term viability of the treatment. The article also notes that neither story engaged in disease-mongering and both cited only one outside source.

The article expresses surprise that there was no mention of radiation, chemotherapy, or bone marrow transplants in either story. It suggests that at least the WebMD story discussed bone marrow transplants. The article also mentions that the study is a Phase I trial and that researchers intend to enroll four more subjects.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of addressing the cost component of gene therapy and providing a balanced view of the potential harms and limitations of the treatment. It also suggests that stories should assume that readers know what Phase I and Phase II trials mean.

The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Reuters fell a little short in comparison to WebMD in writing about a very small but promising study into a new treatment for the most prevalent form of leukemia. The story did a solid job explaining the findings, but it touched too lightly on the side effects of the treatment and the hard road ahead to find a clinical application. We give Reuters high marks, though, for finding an outside expert who could temper some of the enthusiasm found in quotes from the authors in both this story and the WebMD piece. We also like that Reuters at least raised the issue of costs. As both stories note, researchers have been trying to find a way to use genetically engineered cells to fight cancer for 20 years, making even a small study like this interesting news. Both stories sounded some cautionary notes, but Reuters could have more thoroughly shown that the study’s results were promising but not proof that a cure for leukemia is within sight.",Gene therapy shown to destroy leukemia tumors,"The Reuters story was the better of the two.

565,"### Context: President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that Senate Democrats are obstructing his judicial nominees, but a report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) shows that Trump's appointees were actually confirmed faster than those of President Barack Obama in his first year. The report also found that Trump had the most circuit court confirmations of any first-year president since at least Harry Truman. Trump nominated 19 people to the U.S. circuit court of appeals, with 12 confirmed in his first year. He also nominated 49 people to U.S. district court judgeships, with six confirmed in his first year. The report also noted that half of Trump's circuit court nominees were approved in less than 100 days, the highest percentage since Bill Clinton. However, the wait times for district court nominees have been longer for Trump. Two nominees waited 173 and 171 days, respectively, the longest wait times since 2001 in a president's first year. The CRS report also found that a higher percentage of Trump's district court nominees were less qualified than Obama's. Additionally, Trump's nominees faced more procedural opposition and general opposition from Democrats. Trump has often complained about the number of vacancies on the federal court he inherited from Obama, suggesting that Obama got complacent. However, the high number of vacancies was actually due to Senate Republicans virtually stopping the confirmation of Obama's judicial nominees during his final two years as president. Republicans also blocked Obama's attempt to fill a Supreme Court opening. Overall, the CRS report shows that Trump's judicial nominees were confirmed faster than Obama's, but faced more opposition and had a higher percentage of less qualified nominees.

566,"### Context: Nebraska Medicine and the University of Nebraska Medical Center have implemented a new plan to improve access to behavioral health care. Limited access to psychiatric providers is a problem both regionally and nationally, with behavioral health providers being concentrated in urban areas and leaving rural areas underserved. Additionally, more than half of providers in Nebraska are over the age of 50 and retiring faster than they can be replaced. The stigma around seeking behavioral health care has also lessened somewhat. 

To address these issues, Nebraska Medicine and the University of Nebraska Medical Center have started returning stable patients to their primary care providers for ongoing care. This frees up appointment slots for new patients. Previously, psychiatric treatment providers would follow patients indefinitely, leaving few openings for new patients. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, 92% of outpatient psychiatry visits at Nebraska Medicine were return visits. 

Under the new plan, new patients are referred by their primary care providers and are evaluated to determine the appropriate track for their treatment. Those on the consultation track will have several more visits and, once stable, will be referred back to their primary care provider. Those with more persistent or severe conditions will remain under the care of psychiatrists or psychiatric advanced practice providers who can prescribe medications. The decision on which track to follow is based on the complexity of the patient's condition, including stability and history, rather than the diagnosis itself. 

The team behind the new plan believes that a significant number of patients can be transferred back to primary care providers, which will help alleviate the shortage of psychiatric providers and improve access to care. By returning stable patients to their primary care providers, Nebraska Medicine and the University of Nebraska Medical Center hope to open up more appointment slots for new patients and ensure that those with more severe conditions receive the specialized care they need.

568,"### Context: The latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has had a significant impact on the economy, particularly on the trade of meat from wild animals. The outbreak, which was declared in May, has resulted in 38 confirmed cases and 14 deaths. The virus spreads through bodily fluids and is known to jump from animals such as monkeys and bats to humans. In the past, it was suspected that the West Africa outbreak began when a 2-year-old boy in Guinea was infected by a bat. In Mbandaka, the trade hub for Congo's northwestern Equateur province, the trade of wild animal meat is a major industry. However, since the outbreak, business has decreased by almost half. The World Health Organization has advised against trade and travel restrictions, but disease experts warn that precautions are still necessary as monkeys and bats are sold live throughout the region. Demand for bush meat has dwindled, with sales dropping from about 100 animals a day to about 20. Some traders have been told to stop sending monkeys and bats to buyers in the capital, Kinshasa. However, Congo's health minister has stated that there are no plans to ban sales of bush meat in the province, as it is not the primary way the Ebola virus spreads. Instead, the government is focusing on promoting good hygiene practices and tracking down anyone who had close contact with infected individuals. Health efforts can be challenging in communities where many people consider Ebola to be witchcraft or do not believe the disease exists. Some traders and residents in Mbandaka continue to consume wild animals, as they are a main source of food. In Kinshasa, the capital, efforts are being made to prevent the spread of Ebola, but some customs and practices remain unchanged.

569,"### Context: The article discusses a viral photo of a weasel riding on the back of a woodpecker in flight. The photo was taken by amateur photographer Martin Le-May while bird watching in a park in Essex, England. Le-May heard the screech of a bird in distress, picked up his camera, and captured the moment when he realized there was a weasel on the back of the woodpecker. The photo quickly went viral on Twitter with the hashtag #weaselpecker.

The bird in the photo is a European green woodpecker, which is a relatively large bird weighing up to 8 ounces with a wingspan of up to 16 inches. The woodpecker feeds on insects like ants, beetles, and caterpillars, which is likely what it was doing when it was attacked by the weasel. The least weasel, known as a small but fierce carnivore, preys on birds, rabbits, and frogs and can eat 40-60% of its bodyweight each day.

The authenticity of the photo was questioned, but Henry Farid, a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College, stated that he saw no evidence of it being doctored. Farid explained that the alignment of the two animals in the original photos would have required a nearly perfect and coincidental alignment, making it more difficult to create a forgery. Additionally, there were multiple photos of the scene, making it nearly impossible to replicate. There were no noticeable differences in lighting, color, focus, or quality between the weasel and the bird.

Fortunately, the woodpecker successfully evaded the weasel's attack and flew away into some bushes. Le-May mentioned that their presence may have momentarily distracted the weasel, allowing the woodpecker to escape. The woodpecker flew up into the trees and the weasel disappeared into the long grass, hungry.

In summary, the article discusses the viral photo of a weasel riding on the back of a woodpecker. It provides information about the species involved, the authenticity of the photo, and the outcome of the encounter between the two animals.

The room, where flight director Gene Kranz oversaw missions such as Apollo 11 and Apollo 13, has been meticulously recreated to capture the look and feel of July 1969. The restoration project, which began in 2017, raised over $5 million in donations and involved interviewing former flight controllers and directors, as well as sourcing original materials and artifacts. The room is now a National Historic Landmark and will open to the public on Monday. The restoration team used technology to make the room look old, including installing LED lights and flat screens to bring the consoles to life. The room also features big screens that will show key footage from the Apollo 11 mission. The restoration effort was challenging due to the ongoing work in the International Space Station's Mission Control and future moonshot projects. However, the painstaking work paid off, with some Apollo flight controllers becoming emotional when they saw the restored room. The mirror presented by the Apollo 13 crew to the control team, which had been hanging above the room's water fountain, was also restored and returned to its original spot.

The article states that Bachmann is misinterpreting the bill and distorting its contents. The language she seems to be referring to is actually on Page 91 of the bill, which allows people who would be eligible for coverage in the new health care exchange to keep their old policy if they prefer it. The exchange would be a marketplace where insurance companies sell individual policies, and the government would set minimum standards for coverage. However, if someone likes their current plan, they can keep it, regardless of the level of coverage. The article explains that the bill aims to create a new marketplace for people to buy private insurance and that everyone would be required to have some form of coverage. Bachmann's claim that people ""can't purchase private health insurance after a date certain"" is incorrect. The article concludes that Bachmann is not only misinterpreting the language from one page of the bill but also taking that misinterpretation to an extreme by claiming that no private insurance could be sold after a certain date.

572,"### Context: Montana has joined other states, including New York and Massachusetts, in banning flavored electronic cigarettes due to the outbreak of a deadly lung illness tied to vaping products. District Judge Jennifer Lint ruled that the health of the public is more important than the economic harm to vapor product businesses. The ban, which took effect on Wednesday, includes the sale of all flavored e-cigarette products, including nicotine, THC, and CBD products, both in-store and online. The ban does not require businesses to destroy their inventory. The aim of the ban is to prevent further harm to public health while health officials investigate the cause of the vaping-related lung illnesses. As of last week, there have been 2,400 confirmed and probable cases of lung illnesses and 52 deaths nationwide attributed to vaping. Montana has reported seven vaping-related lung illnesses, including one death. Federal health officials are examining vitamin E acetate, an additive used in vaping products, as a potential cause of the illnesses. Business owners argued that there is no connection between flavored vaping liquids and the rise of lung injuries, which they believe are caused by black-market products. They also claimed that they do not sell to minors and that their products are used by people trying to quit or find a safer alternative to tobacco. However, the judge sided with state health officials, who argued that flavored vaping products make it easy for kids to become addicted to nicotine and threaten the progress made in reducing tobacco use. The ban will remain in place for 120 days, giving the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention time to identify the cause of the illnesses.

573,"### Context: The article discusses the American Heart Association's stroke guidelines that support the use of a clot-removing device if clot-busting drugs are ineffective. The article mentions that the cost of removing a clot using these devices is not mentioned. It also states that the article does not provide specific information about the percentage of patients who have a better long-term outcome or any other measurable difference after receiving the new procedure. However, it does mention that the outcome assessed in the studies, ""functional independence after stroke,"" showed significant benefits, with 53-71% of treated patients being functionally independent compared to 29-40% of untreated patients.

The article acknowledges the major risk of using the device, which is the potential for tearing an artery and causing bleeding in the brain. It notes that clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received the clot-removing device after receiving blood thinners is no greater than for those who only receive the blood thinner. However, caution is advised as the risk may not be as low when the procedure is used more widely.

The guidelines mentioned in the article are based on six different high-quality randomized trials and have been endorsed by other medical societies. The article quotes an expert who chaired the committee that wrote the guidelines, stating that the outcomes of the trials were uniformly positive and that the evidence backing the recommendation received the highest rating.

The article also mentions the importance of getting patients to specialized stroke treatment centers quickly, as these procedures can only be performed by highly-trained interventionists. However, it does not provide information about the number of stroke centers throughout the country or the accessibility of these centers for most residents in the US.

Overall, the article provides information about the American Heart Association's stroke guidelines supporting the use of a clot-removing device when clot-busting drugs are ineffective. It mentions the benefits of the procedure in terms of functional independence after stroke but does not provide specific data on long-term outcomes or other measurable differences. The article also acknowledges the risks associated with the procedure and the need for caution when using it more widely.
Claim: Heart Association's Stroke Guidelines Support Clot-Removing Device If clot-busting drugs don't work, device can be used to pull the blockage out through the artery
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"A Medtronic device used to remove clots during stroke. This brief article explains why a certain subset of people who have strokes may be treated more effectively with a new procedure than with existing alternatives. The new procedure sends a thin wire tube through their blood vessels to the location of a clot in the brain and removes it. The story did an excellent job of listing the complex criteria required to find the patients for whom this procedure is now recommended. It could have provided more specifics about the benefits associated with the procedure and its costs. And one of the experts tapped for commentary is a paid consultant to companies who make the devices used in this procedure, and the story should have alerted readers to that fact. The new guidelines are the result of months of study by a committee of the American Heart Association. Implementation of these guidelines will require much more systematic coordination of stroke care than currently exists. Currently, smaller community hospitals can quickly assess a patient, get an imaging study, and start tPA (clot-busting medication delivered by IV) within an hour or two after symptoms begin. But to assess eligibility for endovascular clot retrieval (the procedure discussed here), and transport patients to centers that provide the highly specialized procedures, could take time. There is good-quality evidence that such coordination of stroke care would produce clinically important benefits, but the logistical and cost challenges that have yet to be addressed are significant.","Heart Association's Stroke Guidelines Support Clot-Removing Device If clot-busting drugs don't work, device can be used to pull the blockage out through the artery","This story reports on the American Heart Association’s endorsement of the use of a clot-removing device in the treatment of ischemic stroke. The story does a good job of describing the procedure and the evidence behind it.

The story also could have been improved by providing some information about the availability of the procedure and the number of stroke centers in the US. Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke and is caused by a clot that blocks blood flow to the brain. The clot-removing device is used when the clot is in the carotid artery, which is located in the neck. The story does a good job of describing the procedure and the evidence behind it.

574,"### Context: The article debunks a claim that world leaders created the COVID-19 pandemic as a distraction from an approaching doomsday asteroid. The claim suggests that NASA and the Vatican Observatory discovered a large comet in November 2019 that would inevitably collide with Earth. It further alleges that a secret meeting was held by world leaders to develop a plan to implement a ""scapegoat virus"" (COVID-19) to distract people and initiate a worldwide quarantine.

The article refutes this claim by pointing out logical flaws. It states that world leaders did not come together to announce a global quarantine and force people to stay at home with their families. The response to COVID-19 has varied from one country to another, and even within the United States. President Donald Trump's actions and statements contradict the alleged secret meeting and the plan to force people to spend time with their families.

Furthermore, the claim suggests that a ""scapegoat virus"" may not have been an effective tactic to make people spend time with their families. Travel restrictions and social distancing measures have separated families, and essential workers are still operating, often away from their families. The article also highlights that there is no evidence to support the claim that COVID-19 was human-made. Scientists have debunked the idea that the virus was created in a laboratory, as it closely resembles other naturally occurring coronaviruses.

In conclusion, the article dismisses the claim that world leaders created the COVID-19 pandemic as a distraction from an approaching doomsday asteroid. It highlights the logical flaws in the claim and the lack of evidence to support it.

The test, called the Brain Trauma Indicator, is designed to diagnose intracranial lesions or structural brain damage. The release notes that the availability of the blood test could potentially reduce the number of CT scans performed on patients with concussion, saving costs for the healthcare system. However, the release does not provide any cost data to support this claim. The blood test was able to predict the presence or absence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan with high accuracy. The release claims that the test can rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients suspected of having a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). However, there is no explanation provided for how the FDA arrived at this assessment. The release does not mention any potential harms of the blood test, such as the possibility of missing an injury or false positive results. The release describes a multi-center prospective clinical study that evaluated the performance of the blood test by comparing its results with CT scan results. However, it does not provide the citation for publication of this study. The release also does not mention the name of the trial or where it had been published. The article notes that the release missed an opportunity to share the trial results in a transparent fashion. The release does a good job of explaining the typical ways that a brain injury is evaluated in an emergency department and compares the blood test to the existing standard, a CT scan.

The release does not name the study funders. Overall, the article highlights the FDA's authorization of the blood test and raises some concerns about the lack of cost data, potential harms, and transparency in sharing trial results.
Claim: FDA authorizes marketing of first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The Food and Drug Administration approved for marketing a blood test that uses the presence of certain proteins to predict whether adults with a suspected concussion have structural brain injury, and which could conceivably reduce the number of people who undergo costlier computed tomography (CT) scans. The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Its anticipated that knowing these levels can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which don’t. We wish the release had included the research institutions involved and any publications relating to the study so that we could evaluate the evidence. This evidence was also missing from a CNN story we also reviewed on the test. There were approximately 2.8 million traumatic brain injury (TBI) visits to the emergency department in 2013, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and of these, TBI contributed to the deaths of 50,000 people.The release predicts that about one-third of patients may be able to forego CT scans because of this test’s predictive value. While the blood test reportedly has high sensitivity and specificity, logistical issues may lead doctors to do the test and continue to scan. Emergency department doctors may not be able to wait at least 3-4 hours for the blood test results since this would impact other workflows. News releases about concussion are bound to get a lot of attention. In this case, the news release doesn’t clearly spell out to lay readers what this test does. It’s not a test for concussion, as a casual reader might glean from the way it’s worded.",FDA authorizes marketing of first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults,"This news release from the FDA announces the agency’s approval of the first blood test to aid in the evaluation of concussion in adults.

576,"### Context: The article debunks the claim that California was implementing a policy to teach kindergartners that there are 15 different genders. The claim originated from right-leaning websites, which presented the policy as an example of ""progressive sexual indoctrination"" in schools. However, a closer examination of the guidelines revealed that the claim was grossly misleading.

The Health Education Framework (HEF) created by the California State Board of Education (SBE) provides policies and guidelines for the health, well-being, and development of K-12 students. The guidelines were updated and revised in January 2019, and as part of the process, public feedback and consultation were sought.

The relevant section of the guidelines related to first-grade students, not kindergartners, and provided recommended reading materials for parents, not teachers. One of the recommended books, ""Who Are You? The Kids Guide to Gender Identity,"" addresses issues surrounding gender identity among children and emphasizes that an individual child is best-placed to decide their own gender identity. The book mentions 12 descriptive terms for gender identity, not 12 or 15 separate and distinct gender identities.

Another recommended book, ""It's Not the Stork! A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families and Friends,"" explains how babies are made, how children grow and develop, and how they can understand their own bodies. The book only recognizes two genders, male and female, and explains the anatomical differences between boys and girls.

The claim that the curriculum was mandatory and that parents had no opt-out option was false. The guidelines were meant to provide guidance for teachers and administrators, and school districts were not obligated to use the suggested curriculum or handouts.

In summary, the claim that California was implementing a policy to teach kindergartners that there are 15 different genders is misleading. The guidelines were for first-grade students, not kindergartners, and provided recommended reading materials for parents, not teachers. The inclusion of different books on gender identity and anatomy aimed to provide a range of perspectives, and the curriculum was not mandatory, allowing school districts to decide whether to use the suggested materials.
Claim: In 2019, California education authorities formulated a policy that, if implemented, would force parents to allow their children to be taught that ""there are 15 genders.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"When asked what consequences there might be if a parent or guardian declined to read any of the suggested books with their child, the Department of Education spokesperson replied simply, “None.”","In 2019, California education authorities formulated a policy that, if implemented, would force parents to allow their children to be taught that ""there are 15 genders.","What's true: California's State Board of Education revised its health education framework in January 2019 to include a section on gender identity.

577,"### Context: A study conducted in Massachusetts on the effectiveness of testosterone gel in older men with mobility problems was halted after six months due to the high number of heart, breathing, and skin problems experienced by the participants using the hormone gel compared to those using a placebo gel. The study, reported by the New England Journal of Medicine, raises concerns about the safety of giving testosterone to older individuals. Testosterone levels decline with age in men, and supplementing it in healthy men can help build muscle mass, strength, and lower the risk of disability. However, this study was the first to assess the effectiveness of testosterone in men over 65 with mobility problems. The 209 volunteers, with an average age of 74, had various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The recipients of the testosterone gel showed improvement in walking up stairs and performing chest- and leg-press exercises. However, by the end of the study, 23 patients in the testosterone group and five in the placebo group experienced side effects such as fainting, chest pain, or heart attack. One man in the testosterone group died of a suspected heart attack. Although the numbers were too small to be statistically significant, the researchers noted that men receiving testosterone had more serious and life-threatening side effects, which lasted for three months after the trial ended. The study was designed to assess mobility limitation, a common syndrome in the elderly that predicts disability, poor quality of life, and mortality. The manufacturer of the testosterone gel, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, stated that they believe the men in the study are not representative of the typical testosterone replacement therapy population. The researchers and the National Institute on Aging, which funded the trial, suggested that the high doses of testosterone received by the participants may have contributed to the side effects. It is important for doctors considering prescribing testosterone for older patients to be aware of the potential serious risks associated with the treatment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently approves testosterone for other patients, but not for older men with age-related decline or mobility problems.

578,"### Context: A new vaccine has been developed that could potentially help in the treatment of heroin addiction. The vaccine, which has been tested on mice and monkeys, works by blocking the high that heroin produces in the brain. The researchers believe that the vaccine could be safe for human trials, although no human research is currently planned. The vaccine works by using a heroin-tetanus-toxoid conjugate, which elicits an immune response that neutralizes heroin. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the vaccine in the animal studies. However, it is important to note that the study was conducted in highly controlled lab conditions and not in humans. The vaccine is still in the preliminary stages of research, and more studies are needed to determine its effectiveness and safety in humans. The researchers believe that the vaccine could be a potential treatment option for heroin addiction, but it is unlikely to be a panacea and other treatment options would still be needed. The story does not provide any information on the rising abuse of heroin and other opioids, which would have provided more context to the research. It is also worth noting that one of the researchers has filed a patent application for the technology used in the vaccine. Overall, while the vaccine shows promise in animal studies, more research is needed before it can be considered a viable treatment option for heroin addiction.

The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Credit: Paul Asman and Jill Lenoble The story describes early development of a vaccine for blocking the high from heroin. The story, especially the headline, makes the leap that because it’s worked in a few monkeys, it will work in people (and be safe). It’s just too soon in the scientific research process for anyone to know if this “vaccine” will work in people. To its credit, the story did include some comments from an independent expert who discussed how the vaccine–if it ever comes to market–would not be a “panacea” for heroin addiction. Thousands of Americans are dying every year from heroin overdoses and the numbers are increasing. Along with the deaths, there are also viral infections from dirty needles, such as hepatitis C and HIV. New ways to treat heroin addiction are needed–but that doesn’t mean journalists should shine a spotlight on preclinical research, potentially raising false hopes of readers.","NEW VACCINE COULD STOP HEROIN ABUSE BY BLOCKING HIGH, STUDY SUGGESTS","This story reports on a new vaccine that may be able to block the high that heroin produces in the brain.

The post containing this claim was flagged by Facebook as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. COVID-19 has killed over half a million people worldwide, but there is currently no approved vaccine for the general public. Many potential vaccines are undergoing safety trials in humans, and only one vaccine has been approved for limited use by the Chinese government for military personnel. There is no evidence that children have died from any of the COVID-19 vaccines being developed. Fact-checking organizations have debunked similar claims in the past, including the claim that seven children in Senegal died after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence to support the claim that a future vaccine will contain microchips. The U.S. is not developing an ""antivirus"" for COVID-19 that includes an RFID chip, and there is no evidence that Democrats are pushing for mandatory vaccinations or microchip implants to fight the coronavirus. While some states may require vaccinations for students if a vaccine becomes available, there is currently no requirement for students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to school. State laws govern immunization requirements for schoolchildren, with exemptions allowed for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. In summary, the claim that four children died immediately after taking the coronavirus vaccine is false, and there is no evidence to support the claim that a future vaccine will contain microchips.

In response, a Facebook post urged readers to contact the governor's mansion to request a tour, highlighting the inconsistency of allowing certain businesses to reopen while keeping the mansion closed. The post described how the original poster called the mansion and was told that tours were not available due to the nationwide pandemic and safety concerns. The poster expressed frustration at the perceived infringement on their rights and asked for the supervisor's information. The post was shared in various iterations on social media.

On April 27, 2020, the original post was not available, but copies of it were spread throughout social media. Some sharers of the post altered the wording slightly to make it seem like they had written it themselves. On the same day, Facebook user Professa Cross claimed to be the original poster and changed the privacy settings of the post. They also urged people to check their voter status and get involved in local government and community.

When contacted at the number provided in the post, a recording stated that the mansion was closed to the public until further notice. The official website of the governor's mansion also confirmed the closure, stating that public tours were canceled to ensure the health and safety of Georgia families. Archived versions of the website from April 21 and April 9, 2020, showed the same message, indicating that the mansion had been closed previously and had not reopened. The closure message was added between March 9, 2020, and March 30, 2020.

In summary, despite Governor Kemp's decision to reopen the state of Georgia, the governor's mansion remained closed for tours during the COVID-19 pandemic.

582,"### Context: The article discusses the involvement of Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase in the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The DAPL is an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation that has faced protests from environmental activists and the tribe since 2014. The protesters, known as ""water protectors,"" have been camping near the site since April 2016 to stop the project, citing concerns about the pipeline's impact on sacred sites and water supply.

Financial documents from Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline builder, reveal that several large banking institutions, including Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Canada, Suntrust Bank, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Citibank, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase, have provided credit for the project. In response, environmental activists have been urging supporters to boycott these banks through social media memes and petitions.

The article highlights that the protests at Standing Rock have gained international attention and have been labeled a national crisis and an international scandal. The United Nations' Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has deployed a member to monitor the situation, and President Obama has asked the Army Corps of Engineers to explore alternative routes for the pipeline.

The letter mentioned in the article, addressed to the Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs), urges the banks involved in financing the DAPL to take swift action to stop the violation of Native Americans' rights. The letter raises concerns that the project goes against the Equator Principles, which set minimum standards for community and environmental accountability.

According to Energy Transfer Partners, the DAPL is a 1,172-mile pipeline that will connect the Bakken and Three Forks production areas in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. The pipeline aims to enable the domestic production of light sweet crude oil to reach major refining markets in a more direct, cost-effective, safer, and environmentally responsible manner.

In conclusion, the article confirms that Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase are indeed invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has sparked protests and calls for boycotts from environmental activists and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.

When clocks spring forward in the United States, it is likely to increase heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, and reduce worker productivity. Contrary to previous beliefs, daylight saving time does not significantly cut the nation's energy bill. Disruptions to sleep patterns can have detrimental effects, as shown by a study that found a 25 percent increase in heart attacks on the Monday after daylight saving time began. The practice was adopted during World War Two as an energy-saving measure, but studies have failed to show significant energy savings associated with the shift. Many people express frustration and confusion about losing an hour's sleep due to daylight saving time. Abolishing or extending daylight saving time year-round would require a law passed by the U.S. Congress. Currently, Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not reset their clocks twice a year.

584,"### Context: The article discusses a potential Alzheimer's vaccine that has shown promising results in mice. The vaccine has been found to reduce the buildup of beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. The story mentions that a previous Alzheimer's vaccine attempt had harmful side effects, such as brain inflammation, but does not explicitly caution that safety in mice does not guarantee safety in humans.

The article also highlights the lack of discussion on the costs of developing and administering the vaccine. It mentions a British study that estimated the potential savings of a hypothetical vaccine that delayed the onset of Alzheimer's by five years. The study estimated that the justified cost of such a vaccine would be $1,175 per dose if given every two years, but this cost would decrease if the vaccine only delayed the onset of the disease by one year.

The story does not provide data on the differences in amyloid buildup between mice given the vaccine and those not given it. However, a news release stated that the vaccine prompted a 40% reduction in beta-amyloid and up to a 50% reduction in tau, with no adverse immune response.

The article also fails to mention that many vaccines and drug therapies that have been successful in mice have later proven unsuccessful in humans. It also does not caution that treatments aimed at limiting protein buildup, like the vaccine, have not shown much benefit in humans thus far.

The story lacks independent sources and does not mention any conflicts of interest. It does mention that the vaccine is among several promising treatments for Alzheimer's and that another Alzheimer's vaccine is undergoing clinical trials. It also mentions that current available medicines for Alzheimer's have a modest, short-term effect.

The article acknowledges that the vaccine is not yet available and has not begun clinical research in humans. However, it does not provide a timeframe for when the vaccine might become widely available.

Overall, the article is based on a news release and does not provide much additional information beyond what is stated in the release. It lacks important details, such as the methodology of the study and the potential limitations of the vaccine.
Claim: Researcher: Alzheimer's vaccine could cut dementia in half, human trials may be next
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story reports on a study done in laboratory mice that showed a vaccine decreased the build-up of two proteins, amyloid and tau, that are associated with Alzheimer’s. The story mentions this was a mouse study and acknowledges it isn’t the only potential avenue under study to arrest those harmful substances. However, it gives an overly optimistic spin, using the word “promising” and playing up a speculative comment in a UT Southwestern Medical Center news release that dementia cases “could drop by half” if there’s a vaccine that delays the onset of Alzheimer’s by five years. The story also doesn’t caution that success in animals often doesn’t translate to benefits in humans, and that other treatments targeting these proteins have not panned out. Also missing: discussions of costs and potential harms and comments from independent sources. As the U.S. population ages, dementia is becoming more common. Millions of families are coping with a person who has a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. Available treatments do not prevent or cure Alzheimer’s and at best slow down the progression of symptoms for short periods. Considerable effort has focused on new treatments that seek to break down or prevent the deposition of abnormal proteins that appear to increase as memory loss progresses. So far these new treatments have not been shown to help. Initially they were tried in individuals with advanced disease but now are being used in patients with mild symptoms as a way to prevent progression. Even here, trials have not shown positive results that are clinically meaningful. A vaccine to “prevent” Alzheimer’s is appealing in that it works even earlier in the process, maybe even before symptoms appear. However, it isn’t clear that a vaccine will actually improve clinical outcomes. The fact that this small study in mice led to several optimistic headlines — not just USA Today’s — reflects how desperate we are for progress.

585,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests receiving a clot-buster drug before reaching the hospital may reduce stroke disability. The study included 658 stroke patients, with half receiving the drug at the hospital and half receiving it in the ambulance. The release presents the benefits of receiving the drug in the ambulance as a rate, stating that 182 out of every 1,000 patients treated before arriving at the hospital were less disabled. However, it is unclear how this rate was derived from just 329 patients. The release also mentions the risks of using the drug, stating that it could hurt a patient's chances if they are having a hemorrhagic stroke. However, it fails to note that some patients with a negative CT scan may still have a hemorrhage after receiving the drug. The findings of the study were presented at a conference but were not published in a journal, and the release does not explain why only two-thirds of the patients from the original study were included in the re-analysis. The release does not engage in disease mongering and explains the funding source. It also discusses how the approach being studied compares to the standard of care. However, it does not address the availability of mobile stroke units beyond UCLA's program. The release briefly mentions previous research on the benefits of receiving the clot-buster drug early. Overall, the release is cautious in its language but lacks important information and does not establish the novelty of the study or its findings.
Claim: Receiving a clot-buster drug before reaching the hospital may reduce stroke disability
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Mobile stroke unit, University of Tennessee College of Medicine Photo: Business Wire Clot busting drugs are an established part of the tool kit in reducing damage related to strokes. Understanding exactly when to administer them is key to making sure they are used in the most effective way possible. This release describes a study of one mobile stroke unit’s experience administering clot-busting drugs — or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). These study findings have not been peer reviewed for publication in a journal and appear to have major caveats around them. We won’t know all the details until the full study is published, and so we were pleased to see some caution expressed in the news release. A few more additions, like cost information and a better explanation of the benefits, would have helped make this release even better. [Editor’s note: A reference to clot-busting drugs “saving lives” was removed from the review. As noted in the comments section, the scope of benefits offered by tPA is controversial and the American Heart Association withdrew “life-saving” claims about tPA as discussed in these BMJ and Mother Jones stories.] The recent deployment of a handful of mobile stroke units across the country staffed with specialists and CT scanners makes this a timely release, particularly amidst the backdrop of unsustainable health care costs. The cost of outfitting all US cities with these types of units would be very great, and most of the new mobile units have been funded by private donors. Mobile stroke units could be most useful in remote areas where there is a long transport time from the scene to a hospital that could give thrombolytic therapy, but those areas are the least likely to have enough volume of patients to sustain the expertise of the mobile stroke unit’s staff.",Receiving a clot-buster drug before reaching the hospital may reduce stroke disability,"This news release describes a study of 658 stroke patients in Los Angeles County who were treated with a clot-busting drug either in the ambulance or at the hospital. The release does a good job of explaining the benefits of the treatment in terms of the number of patients who would benefit, as well as the risks. However, the release doesn’t address the availability of mobile stroke units, which are not widely available. It also doesn’t address the costs of the treatment, which are significant. The release also doesn’t address the limitations of the study, such as the fact that the results may have been skewed because the patients who received the drug in the ambulance were more likely to have had a milder stroke. The release also doesn’t address the fact that the study was presented at a meeting but has not been published in a journal. The release also doesn’t address the fact that the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health."

The area has been declared a quarantine zone with a 7-kilometer (4-mile) surveillance area also established around the farms. Pinol said he was informed Thursday that 37,000 birds have died from avian influenza subtype H5, which can cause illness and deaths in both animals and humans. Experts believe the ducks to be the virus carrier, he added. He said he has informed President Rodrigo Duterte, the Department of Health and will report the outbreak to the World Organization for Animal Health. Pinol said farmers did not immediately report the deaths, which spiked in July, because they thought were from ordinary poultry disease. Alene Asteria Vytiaco, an official of the Bureau of Animal Industry, said they will send samples collected from the farms to the World Organization for Animal Health and the Australian Animal Health Laboratory for further testing. ___ This version corrects that the Philippines is ordering fowl, not fouls, to be culled.

587,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Rep. Michael McCaul that President Barack Obama said over 20 times that he did not have the legal authority to take executive action on immigration. The article examines statements made by Obama from 2010 to 2014 to determine if this claim is accurate.

The article first mentions that in June 2012, the Obama administration issued a ""deferred action"" directive that prevented the deportation of young immigrants who had not broken any laws. This move was seen as an abuse of authority by critics and in line with the yet-to-pass DREAM Act by proponents.

The article then goes on to analyze statements made by Obama regarding his authority to act on immigration. It mentions that Obama has made statements both supporting and contradicting the claim made by McCaul. The article provides examples of statements where Obama said he did not have the power to act on immigration without congressional action, as well as statements where he hinted at having some wiggle room to take action.

The article concludes that while McCaul's count of over 20 examples is too high, there are less than 15 solid examples from 2010 to 2014 where Obama stated he did not have the legal authority to take action on immigration. The article also mentions a memo from the federal Office of Legal Counsel stating that Obama's actions in 2014 were within the government's discretionary powers.

Overall, the article supports the claim made by McCaul that Obama said multiple times that he did not have the legal authority to act on immigration.
Claim: President Barack Obama ""said over 20 times he did not have the legal authority"" to act as he did on immigration.
The claim veracity: true

588,"### Context: The claim states that a morgue worker was accidentally cremated while napping or pretending to be dead. However, the article clarifies that this claim is false and originated from a fake news site called World News Daily Report (WNDR). The article from WNDR reported that a morgue worker named Henri Paul Johnson in Beaumont, Texas, was inadvertently incinerated by a coworker while he napped on the job. It further stated that another coworker heard Johnson's death screams but it was too late to save him. However, the article confirms that there is no truth to this story and the photograph of the supposedly deceased morgue worker was actually a picture of a different person who was arrested for DUI. The photograph of the coworker was also a picture of a different person, a forensic pathologist.

The article mentions that variations of this false story were reposted by other fake news sites, such as one spoofing ABC News, with different names and locations but the same basic premise. It also notes that in April 2018, the fake news site 8shit.net repurposed this story as an April Fool's prank, claiming that a morgue employee pretending to be dead was cremated by coworkers.

In summary, the claim that a morgue worker was accidentally cremated while napping or pretending to be dead is false. The story originated from a fake news site and the photographs used in the article were of different individuals. Variations of this false story were also reposted by other fake news sites.

589,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that U.S. President Donald Trump and the federal government were slow to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic due to distractions from the impeachment trial. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested that the government's attention was diverted by the impeachment proceedings. However, op-eds refuted this claim, and Trump himself stated that he wouldn't have done any better if he hadn't been impeached.

The timeline presented in a tweet is generally correct. Trump was officially impeached on December 19, 2019. It is unclear when exactly Trump was first alerted about the potential pandemic, but U.S. intelligence officials were warning him about the outbreak as early as January. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued its first alert for U.S. clinicians on January 8, 2020.

During the impeachment trial and after the CDC issued its warnings, Trump held political rallies and went golfing. The tweet mentioned in the article lists several dates when Trump visited a golf course, including January 18 and 19, February 1 and 15, and March 7 and 8. All of these golf outings took place at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump also hosted rallies on various dates, including January 9, 14, 28, and 30, and February 10, 19, 20, 21, and 28.

At a rally in South Carolina on February 28, Trump spoke about the coronavirus, dismissing Democrats' complaints and accusing them of politicizing the virus. He claimed that the U.S. was ""totally prepared"" and mocked the Democratic Party for their chaotic efforts in the Iowa caucuses. Trump stated that the virus started in China and didn't spread widely in the United States due to the early actions of his administration.

In summary, the article confirms the claim that Trump golfed and held rallies after learning about the threat of the coronavirus. It provides specific dates for these activities and highlights Trump's statements about the virus during his rallies.

590,"### Context: The claim that the Obama administration created a program to provide free cell phones to welfare recipients is partially true. The Lifeline benefit program, implemented by the Federal Communication Commission in 1984, provides discounts on basic monthly landline telephone service and initial installation fees for qualified telephone subscribers. As cell phone usage increased and fees dropped, the program expanded to include wireless technology. Prepaid cell phone companies, such as Safelink Wireless, Assurance Wireless, and Reachout Wireless, specialize in providing Lifeline-covered telephone services to qualifying participants.

However, the claim that welfare recipients receive completely free cell phones and airtime is not entirely accurate. The Lifeline program is funded by telecommunications service providers, who contribute a percentage of their revenues to the Universal Service Fund (USF). Some companies choose to recover their USF contributions directly from customers through a line item on their phone bills, but the FCC does not require this charge to be passed on to customers. Lifeline program participants are not charged any fees by the companies that collect Universal Service fees from their customers.

The Lifeline program has faced criticism for potential waste, fraud, and abuse, leading to a comprehensive overhaul in 2012. Various websites promoting Lifeline benefits have emerged, but they are privately operated and not officially connected to the federal government or the Obama administration.

While the claim suggests that the Obama administration created the program solely for welfare recipients, the Lifeline program is available to income-eligible consumers, not exclusively welfare recipients. The number of people with Lifeline phones grew from 7.1 million to 12.5 million between 2008 and 2012, with numerous wireless companies participating in the program.

In summary, the Lifeline benefit program, implemented by the FCC in 1984, provides discounts on landline and wireless telephone services to income-eligible consumers. While the program has been expanded to include wireless technology, the claim that welfare recipients receive completely free cell phones and airtime is not entirely accurate. The program is funded by telecommunications service providers, and participants are not charged any fees. The Lifeline program is not exclusively for welfare recipients, but available to income-eligible consumers.

591,"### Context: The article titled ""Knee Braces Ease Osteoarthritis Pain"" discusses the use of knee braces as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis. The article reports on a company-hosted media briefing where the company presented their findings on the effectiveness of their knee braces.

The article highlights several important points that were missing from the story. Firstly, there was no mention of the costs associated with using knee braces, which can be significant. The story focused on the positive outcomes reported by the company, such as reduced pain, stiffness, disability, and decreased use of pain medications in the group that used the braces. However, there was no information about whether there was a control group and how the results compared. The potential harms associated with the use of knee braces were also not discussed.

The article points out that using a company-hosted media briefing as the sole source of information is not best practice. Additionally, the study mentioned in the story was small, so the results may not be applicable to the general population with knee osteoarthritis. The lack of information about the study design and whether there was a control group is also a significant limitation.

The article raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest among the clinicians quoted in the story. While there was no disclosure of financial conflicts of interest, the article suggests that this issue should have been discussed, considering the setting of the company-hosted media briefing.

Furthermore, the article notes that the story did not provide a meaningful comparison of outcomes between knee braces and other treatment approaches, such as knee replacement or non-surgical methods. The prevalence and availability of knee braces in general, as well as the specific knee brace studied, were also not discussed.

In conclusion, the article argues that reporting from a company-hosted media briefing is not much different from relying solely on a news release. The story lacked important information about costs, study design, potential harms, conflicts of interest, and comparisons with other treatment approaches.

592,"### Context: The article discusses the potential impact of marijuana legalization on drug-sniffing dogs and police departments. Macon County Sheriff Howard Buffett argues that if Illinois legalizes marijuana, police departments would have to replace all of their dogs, causing financial hardship. Chad Larner, the director of the K-9 Training Academy in Macon County, claims that retraining the dogs would be abusive, and many retired drug dogs would have to be euthanized if marijuana is legalized.

However, representatives from the Denver Police Department and the Seattle Police Department dispute these claims. A spokesperson from the Denver PD states that their dogs are trained to be people-friendly and that retired dogs stay with their handlers. The Seattle PD also confirms that retired dogs remain with their handlers and that the idea of euthanizing them is nonsense.

Both departments also refute the need for active retraining or retirement of the dogs if marijuana is legalized. The Denver PD continues to use dogs trained on marijuana, as there is still a black market for it. The Seattle PD stopped using marijuana as a training aid but continued training the dogs on other drugs. They argue that over time, the dogs lose the skill of detecting marijuana if they are no longer rewarded for it.

One complication mentioned is that a dog previously trained to sniff marijuana may complicate legal efforts to prosecute individuals caught with legal weed and illegal drugs. The argument is that a dog alerting on marijuana could lead to a search and arrest for possession of another drug, which may violate the law in states where marijuana is legal.

In conclusion, the article challenges the claim that the legalization of marijuana will force police departments to euthanize their drug-sniffing dogs. Representatives from the Denver PD and the Seattle PD dispute this claim, stating that retired dogs stay with their handlers and that retraining or retirement is not necessary. The article also highlights the potential legal complications of using dogs trained to detect marijuana in states where it is legal.

593,"### Context: Costs are not applicable as there is no diagnostic test developed yet. Quantified benefits do not apply, as this study was not a clinical trial. Quantified harms are not directly applicable to this type of research. Note, however, that there is a harm of assigning a label of ""pre RA"" to a perfectly healthy person with a positive blood test of unknown significance. There are always potential harms of screening; as in this story, though, they are often ignored.
Claim: Blood Test May Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"There has been recognition that RA results in gradual, cumulative destruction of joints and other parts of the body. Since we now have powerful treatment options, there has been a push to begin using them earlier. However, it’s harder to identify RA in its early stages, when diagnostic techniques such as RF testing aren’t as helpful. Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic techniques for the identification of patients with joint problems in the early stages of RA. That’s the context, and the social problem, described in the article. The study in question, however, is a little different. It’s about understanding the processes that lead to RA and techniques that may, in the future, lead to a test for patients who may develop RA in the future. There is no available evidence that treatment can stave off RA in patients who don’t have symptoms yet. We would have liked to have seen the article use additional sources besides the press release. Where it does not rely on the press release, it seems to stray too far. The article claims that the investigators ""say the finding paves the way for developing a blood test for early diagnosis of the mysterious disease."" We don’t believe they said that, neither in the published study nor even the press release. The authors say the technique could help identify people at risk for developing RA in the future — people who are not yet patients — as opposed to patients who have an early stage of the disease. Contrary to the article’s headline, the study in question did not assess a blood test for RA, and there is no blood test now.

594,"### Context: The article discusses a new study that found that women who stop hormone replacement therapy (HRT) still face an increased risk of breast cancer. The study followed over 100,000 women for an average of 10 years and found that those who had used HRT for at least five years had a 2.7% increased risk of breast cancer compared to those who had never used HRT. The risk decreased slightly after women stopped using HRT, but it remained elevated for at least 10 years after discontinuation.

The article highlights that the risks associated with HRT are relatively small. For example, the risk of breast cancer in the hormone therapy group was less than 0.5% per year. However, the article does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the risks involved in HRT or quantify them in absolute terms.

The story mentions other risks of hormone therapy, such as blood clots and heart attacks, but does not provide detailed information about the strength of the new evidence. It also fails to explain that the findings may not apply to younger women who take hormone therapy for shorter periods of time.

The article briefly mentions that many women taking HRT are receiving a safer treatment at a lower dose for a shorter duration, but it does not provide further information about this option or how much safer it may be.

The article does not engage in disease mongering and quotes multiple experts, indicating that it did not solely rely on a press release for information. However, it does not discuss the costs involved with HRT, which may be understandable given the focus on the risks of the therapy.

In conclusion, the article discusses a new study that found an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have used HRT for at least five years. It highlights the relatively small risks associated with HRT but fails to provide a comprehensive discussion of the risks or quantify them in absolute terms. The article also does not adequately describe the strength of the new evidence or explain that the findings may not apply to younger women.

Claim: Women who quit hormone therapy still live with cancer risk
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story reports on an article published in this week’s Journal of the American Medical Association. The article presents follow-up data from the landmark Women’s Health Initiaive on the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. The new data shows that at three years after stopping hormone therapy, there was no increased risk of heart disease in the hormone therapy group, however the increase in breast cancer risk did persist at three years. The story does not provide adequate details about alternatives to hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms or about lower-hormone options that could potentially confer less risk. The story does not quantify the risks of hormone therapy, in absolute terms or otherwise. This is particularly important for this subject because the risks involved are realtively small. For example, in the study, the risk of breast cancer was less than one half of one percent per year in the hormone therapy group. Furthermore, other than to describe the study as ""sweeping"", the story does not adequately describe the strength of the new evidence. Most importantly, the story does not explain that these findings do not necessarily apply to younger women who take hormone therapy for shorter periods of time. Overall, in focusing solely on the risks of hormone therapy, this story implies that it is not a reasonable choice for women. In reality, when taken by women who are actively experiencing symptoms for short periods of time, hormone therapy is safe and effective.",Women who quit hormone therapy still live with cancer risk,"This is a story about a study that followed women who had taken hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for five years or more to see if the risk of breast cancer remained elevated after they stopped taking the therapy. The study found that the risk of breast cancer remained elevated for at least 10 years after the women stopped taking HRT. The story does a good job of describing the study and the risks of HRT. However, the story should have done a better job of describing the strength of the new evidence and of quantifying the risks of HRT in absolute terms. The story also should have done a better job of explaining that the findings may not apply to younger women who take HRT for shorter periods of time."
595,"### Context: The article discusses the use of zinc as a treatment for the common cold. It mentions that researchers have not reached a consensus on the optimal dose or formulation of zinc, but the story could have provided cost information for over-the-counter zinc products. The article states that taking zinc within the first 24 hours of developing cold symptoms can reduce the duration of a cold by an average of 1 day. However, no data was provided regarding other outcomes such as symptom severity, reduced absences from school, and reduced antibiotic use. The article also notes that a preventive effect was found after 5 months of zinc use, and people who experienced therapeutic benefits took zinc for at least 5 days during their cold.

The article mentions that nasal zinc products, which are associated with loss of smell, were not evaluated in the Cochrane review. It quotes one of the authors of the study suggesting that the potential harms of zinc products are limited to a bad taste and some nausea. However, the full listing of potential side effects includes constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, and oral irritation.

The article acknowledges some limitations of the studies included in the systematic review, such as the lack of blinding participants to their assigned treatment. It also notes that the results may not apply to the elderly or those with underlying illnesses, as the trial participants were between the ages of 1 and 65 and in good health. The article states that the review included 15 studies with a combined 1,360 participants, but only 13 trials analyzed the therapeutic benefit of zinc, while 2 trials evaluated its preventive effect. The authors of the review had more confidence in the conclusions drawn about the duration of sickness and severity of symptoms, but were less confident in other outcomes.

The article does not engage in disease-mongering, but it would have been helpful to provide information on the estimated number of cases of the common cold and days out of work to put the story into perspective. It includes commentary from the review's lead author and Dr. Prasad, who has researched zinc as an essential mineral. Quotes from an independent expert would have been welcomed.

The article could have briefly discussed the efficacy of other types of over-the-counter cold remedies and provided information on the best ways to protect oneself from getting a cold besides zinc products, such as hand hygiene and avoiding touching the face. It also mentions that the most effective formulation and dosage for reducing cold symptoms is currently unknown.

Lastly, the article mentions that zinc lozenges from Coldcure.com were used in many of the trials evaluated in the Cochrane review, but fails to note that they are no longer manufactured. It also states that the first trial evaluating the efficacy of zinc for treating cold symptoms was published in 1984 and does not appear to rely on a news release.

While the column does a nice job of pointing out some of the limitations of the studies included in the review and highlights the fact the review authors cannot make a recommendation for the dosage or preparation, it missed the mark on a few key points. For instance, there was no discussion of costs, (which seems like an important omission, as many readers will want to try the over-the-counter products), there was little mention of the adverse effects of zinc, and there was no commentary from an independent expert. Although most of us view the common cold as a mere nuisance, the infection can have serious clinical and economic impact. The common cold is responsible for a large number of lost work days, lost school days and physician visits. Over $400 million is spent annually in the US for over-the-counter remedies. Unfortunately, the common cold is also responsible for significant number of prescriptions for antibiotics despite the fact that antibiotics do not work against viral infections. The common cold can also trigger ear infections, sinusitis and worsen lung disease. The Cochrane review of published studies assessing the value of a number of different zinc products as both preventives and for treatment provides a new look at a long standing question: Do zinc salts provide any benefit in the treatment or prevention of the common cold?","For Cold Virus, Zinc May Edge Out Even Chicken Soup","This story reports on the results of a recent Cochrane review that found zinc lozenges can reduce the duration of the common cold. The story does a good job of describing the review and its findings, but it could have been improved by providing more detail on the limitations of the studies included in the review, and by providing more detail on the potential harms of zinc products. The story also could have been improved by providing more detail on the cost of zinc products, and by providing more detail on the efficacy of other over-the-counter cold remedies. The story would have been stronger had it included commentary from an independent expert."
596,"### Context: The claim that a 7-year-old girl received breast implants can be traced back to a well-known fake news website called World News Daily Report. The article, titled ""7-year-old Girl Receives Breast Implants for Christmas,"" claimed that a woman named Dana Mason took her daughter, Juliet, to China to have the procedure done. The surgery allegedly took place two days after their arrival and lasted less than two hours. The story gained traction on social media and was re-reported by other fake news outlets.

However, the World News Daily Report clearly states that it is a fake news website and takes responsibility for the satirical and fictional nature of its articles. This particular story was not the first of its kind, as a similar fake report about a 10-year-old girl receiving breast implants in Mexico was published by Empire News in 2014.

In contrast, there have been real cases of children undergoing breast implant procedures for medical reasons. In 1998, the U.K.'s Independent newspaper reported on a 12-year-old girl who received breast implants to correct a deformity that caused her distress. Similarly, in 2001, a U.K. family made plans for their 16-year-old daughter to get breast implants as a birthday present, citing the desire for self-confidence.

The controversy surrounding children getting breast implants has generated attention over the past 20 years. This is likely why clickbait and fake news websites have used false reports, such as the one about the 7-year-old girl, to generate traffic.

In conclusion, the claim that a 7-year-old girl received breast implants can be attributed to a fake news website. While there have been real cases of children undergoing breast implant procedures for medical or personal reasons, the specific story in question is fictional.

He added it would be “catastrophic” if France were to reach a stage on deciding whether to save the lives of certain patients over that of others. “This morning, I appeal to all French people to mobilize in the fight,” he said. The number of deaths in France from the coronavirus increased by more than a third on Sunday to 127 and over 5,400 have been infected. Sources told Reuters on Sunday that France is preparing an order that would put its inhabitants under partial lockdown to combat the pandemic, a move that would tighten further restrictions on public life.

598,"### Context: Waldo Ariel Suero, president of the Dominican Medical Association, has said the alleged the deaths occurred because of patient overcrowding, lack of equipment and bad conditions. He said that the Our Lady of Altagracia Maternity Hospital in Santo Domingo does not have enough incubators and that only three of 10 operating rooms are in use. The hospital has been undergoing renovations since 2014, and the association said it should be temporarily closed, with patients and doctors transferred to other hospitals. Dominican health officials said late Tuesday that the deaths were simply a result of complicated pregnancies and denied Suero’s allegations. Nelson Rodriguez, director of the National Health Service, said some of the babies were born prematurely, had respiratory or neurological problems or congenital cardiac malformations. He said Dominican Republic still has a high infant mortality rate, with 80 percent of deaths blamed on premature births. It is the second time officials raised concerns about a string of hospital deaths in the Dominican Republic. In October 2014, President Danilo Medina dismissed the health minister at the time and the director of the main pediatric public hospital after 10 children died one weekend due to failures in the care and quality of the health center.

599,"### Context: The claim that Americans pay 25 percent of their pay for ""employer provided"" health insurance is somewhat checkable. Polls have shown that 70 percent of Americans support the idea of employer-provided health insurance. However, recent polls also show growing interest in a single-payer healthcare system in the United States. The cost of healthcare coverage in the United States is highly variable, but it is fair to say that it regularly eats into paychecks. The cost of healthcare coverage in the UK is described as ""free at the point of use"" and is paid for through income tax. The exact cost per paycheck in the UK is difficult to verify without knowing the individual's income and other costs. However, comparisons show that Americans spend significantly more on healthcare coverage than people in the UK. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Americans spent $10,209 per capita on healthcare compared to $4,264 in the UK. Overall, the meme is a mixed bag as it shows that Americans spend more on healthcare coverage than people in the UK and that they are not necessarily happy about it.

600,"### Context: The article confirms that the stimulus bill does indeed include the $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers and $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs, as mentioned by Republican Rep. Mike Pence in his speech on the House floor. The $20 million is allocated for clearing barriers in rivers and streams to allow fish migration, while the $25 million is for recreation maintenance, specifically the rehabilitation of off-road vehicle routes. These allocations are part of larger funding amounts for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management, respectively. 

The Senate report on the bill states that these projects can be modified to achieve maximum job creation and the most effective use of resources. A Democratic spokesman defended the funding, stating that preserving national parks and wildlife are reasonable goals and that these projects will provide employment opportunities for American workers. The Fish and Wildlife Service also confirmed that the work to remove fish barriers is ""shovel ready"" and will involve restoring native fish runs across the country.

The article acknowledges that the projects in question account for less than 1 percent of the overall bill, but emphasizes that $45 million is still a significant amount of money. It also notes that any job paid for by the government technically stimulates the economy by creating income and reducing unemployment, even if only by a small amount.

In conclusion, the article confirms that the stimulus bill does include the mentioned allocations of $20 million for fish-barrier removal and $25 million for off-road trails, as stated by Rep. Mike Pence. It presents both the criticism and defense of these allocations, leaving it up to readers to decide if they consider the projects worthy or not.

601,"### Context: Bishop John Folda of the Catholic Diocese of Fargo contracted hepatitis from contaminated food while in Italy for a conference of newly ordained bishops. He served Communion at three churches in Fargo and one church in Jamestown between September 27 and October 7. Folda did not know he had contracted the virus until after returning from Italy. He is feeling better and has not been infectious since October 16, but is still not on a full work schedule. Priests who attended Folda's Mass in Jamestown were notified of his illness. The North Dakota Department of Health stated that the risk of people getting hepatitis A from this situation is low, but they felt it was important for people to know about the possible exposure. The department advised people who received Communion from Folda to check with their doctors if they experience symptoms such as fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, pale stools, or jaundice.

602,"### Context: The article discusses a new therapy called prostatic artery embolization (PAE) for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate. The claim states that the article did not discuss the costs of the procedure and did not provide adequate information about the benefits and potential harms. It also mentions that the study findings were considered preliminary and that the article did not address the limitations of the study.

The article mentions that 66 out of 67 patients in the study experienced improvement in symptoms, but it does not specify what exactly was improved, the extent of the improvement, or the satisfaction level with the improvement. It also does not report on any harms observed in the participants.

The article notes that the study findings were considered preliminary and had not yet been presented at a meeting. It also mentions that the 9-month follow-up period was too short to determine the long-term outcomes of the procedure.

The article includes quotes from clinicians with expertise in treating BPH who do not have apparent ties to the study. It provides some insight into how PAE compares to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), but it fails to mention other surgical and minimally invasive techniques that have comparable effectiveness and fewer complications than TURP.

The article mentions that PAE is still experimental and not widely available. It notes that few physicians are trained to perform the procedure, but it does not explicitly state that it is currently not an option for most men.

The article does not engage in disease-mongering, but it would have been helpful to mention that BPH rarely causes problems that require medical attention.

Overall, the article does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the costs, benefits, and potential harms of PAE for treating BPH. It also fails to address the limitations of the study and the lack of long-term data. The article does not mention that PAE is already in use to treat other non-cancerous conditions.

However, Johns Hopkins Hospital has disclaimed the contents of this update, stating that they did not publish it and do not endorse its contents. The hospital also noted that there have been other hoax emails circulating since 2004, including one about plastic containers causing cancer, which were falsely attributed to Johns Hopkins. The hospital, along with other reputable institutions, has posted warnings on their websites about these false claims. The hospital emphasizes that traditional cancer therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy do work and have resulted in millions of cancer survivors in the United States.

604,"### Context: Florida's chief financial officer, Jeff Atwater, claimed that Florida ranks number one in the country for staged auto accidents. This claim came after several headlines about fabricating car crashes for cash in Miami. Five people in Miami-Dade and one in Naples were arrested for faking car accidents and filing false claims with insurance companies. The scammers billed insurance companies up to $170,000 for medical treatment that was never performed. Atwater's office reported that fraud related to personal injury protection (PIP) insurance costs the average Florida family up to $400 a year. Four Florida cities, including Miami, are among the top 10 in PIP fraud. Over 400 people were charged with PIP fraud in the past two years. Atwater vowed to put these scammers behind bars.

Atwater's statements were based on a report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) that showed a spike in reports of ""staged accident questionable claims"" from 2007 to 2009. The top five states with the most questionable claims were Florida, New York, California, Texas, and Illinois. The top five cities with the most questionable claims were New York, Tampa, Miami, Orlando, and Houston. Florida's high numbers of auto fraud cases are not surprising to observers, as the state has ranked high in insurance fraud-related losses and court-ordered restitution.

However, it is important to note that the numbers Atwater referred to are ""questionable claims,"" which are not yet confirmed as actual staged accidents. Only a small percentage of the claims were related to staged accidents. The NICB report is a useful tool for analysis and identifying potential fraud hot spots, but it does not provide definitive proof of staged accidents.

In summary, Florida has a significant issue with auto insurance fraud, including staged accidents. Atwater's claim about Florida ranking number one in staged auto accidents is based on questionable claims, not confirmed cases. While the numbers are high, it is crucial to distinguish between questionable claims and actual staged accidents.

The article does not mention the potential costs of such a test or provide any information about the technology behind it. It also does not quantify the results of the study or discuss the accuracy of the test. The article mentions that false positives from a saliva test could cause anxiety in patients, while false negatives could falsely reassure patients about their status. The article focuses on the findings of an early study with a small number of participants, but it does not convey the preliminary nature of the research adequately. The article does not provide independent sources and only paraphrases information from the graduate student/principal investigator. It does not discuss how Alzheimer's is currently diagnosed or the risk factors associated with the disease. The article acknowledges that the results are not conclusive enough for clinical usage, but it may give readers the impression that the test's clinical usage is coming soon. The article does not establish the novelty of the research adequately, as previous studies have also looked at saliva markers of Alzheimer's. The article does not mention other research on blood tests, scans, or other approaches to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear how the article was produced, as there is limited information provided. Overall, the article lacks important context and does not provide a satisfactory rating in terms of disease impact or accuracy.
Claim: Alzheimer’s May Show Up in Saliva
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This nugget of a story, while nicely written and easy to read, puts too much emphasis on the promise of new findings and not enough on the actual data involved in the study. Research by the University of Alberta in Canada looked at the composition of saliva from three groups of people — Alzheimer’s patients, people with mild cognitive impairment, and those whose mental skills were normal for their age. An analysis of the saliva from these three distinct groups showed specific differences in certain compounds present. The story suggests that the findings could form the basis of “a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.” But the story offers few if any specifics about the size or design of the study, its limitations, or the actual results of the investigation. While a competing HealthDay story took pains to point out the tentative nature of the study, this Time piece gives readers a cursory and overly optimistic view of its potential. Alzheimer’s dementia is a debilitating and increasingly prevalent condition in our aging society. If the described simple, non-invasive screening test is truly effective (which will take much more testing to find out), it could have an enormous impact that is potentially positive if we develop better treatments for Alzheimer’s patients and can take action based on the results. There is also potential for negative impact resulting from false positive and false negative results, and from knowing about a frightening diagnosis without having the ability to do anything about it.",Alzheimer’s May Show Up in Saliva,"This story reports on a study that found a test for Alzheimer’s disease that uses saliva.

606,"### Context: The article discusses cortical vision impairment (CVI), a condition where the eyes are healthy but the brain has difficulty processing visual information. The article focuses on a young boy named Tripp who suffers from CVI and is receiving therapy from Jillian Colon, the first official CVI Range Endorsee in Mississippi. CVI is usually diagnosed by a neurologist or ophthalmologist and can be caused by various factors such as stroke, decreased oxygenation, head trauma, or other neurological disorders. According to the National Institutes of Health, around 10.5% of children with developmental disabilities have CVI. The condition is also prevalent in developing countries where babies are born with oxygen deprivation.

Colon explains that children with CVI may exhibit certain habits such as looking out the window, not making eye contact, or not blinking when a hand is brought to their face. They may also have distinct color preferences, like looking at lights, viewing objects up close and at odd angles, and difficulty visualizing new surroundings or objects. In Tripp's case, he likes to look at lights and the colors red, yellow, and hot pink.

Colon suggests some strategies to help children with CVI, such as providing a black background with a single object on it, outlining words in their favorite color, reducing complexity in their environment, and turning them away from natural light. While vision can improve with CVI, treatment of the underlying neurological disease is essential. Colon hopes to raise awareness about CVI and provide knowledge to parents and therapists to help children with the condition.

The article concludes by highlighting Tripp's progress and the importance of celebrating small steps. Colon remains hopeful that with the right therapy, children with CVI can improve and adapt to use their vision to the best of their abilities. The article emphasizes the need for early intervention and understanding of CVI to ensure that children receive the necessary interventions.

607,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Barack Obama during a presidential debate in 2008. Obama stated that he had written a letter to Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in March 2007, warning them about the potential wave of foreclosures and urging them to convene a homeownership preservation summit. The article examines the context of the letter and whether it could have predicted the economic crisis of 2008.

The letter, as quoted in the article, expresses concern about people losing their homes and calls for a summit to assess options for addressing the challenge. However, there is no indication in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008 or that he was warning about a systemic threat to the economic system.

The article then looks at public statements made by Bernanke and Paulson around the time Obama sent his letter. Bernanke testified before Congress on March 28, 2007, acknowledging the financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage market but stating that the implications for the housing market as a whole were unclear. On May 15, 2007, Bernanke discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. On May 17, 2007, Bernanke mentioned that the Federal Reserve was considering steps to rein in subprime lending but did not expect significant spillovers to the rest of the economy. Paulson, on June 20, 2007, acknowledged a major housing correction but believed the market was at or near the bottom.

The article concludes that Obama's letter did not have a significant impact, as Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells at the time. Economists interviewed for the article stated that it was too late by October 2008 to prevent the crisis, as the questionable loans and securities had already been issued. While Obama's letter addressed the problems faced by low-income homeowners, it was not an early warning of the economic collapse in 2008.

In summary, the article confirms that Obama did write a letter to Paulson and Bernanke in March 2007, expressing concern about foreclosures. However, the letter did not predict the economic crisis of 2008, and both Bernanke and Paulson did not take significant action in response to the letter.

608,"### Context: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Paratek Pharmaceuticals' antibiotic, Nuzyra, for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia and severe skin infections. Nuzyra was designed to overcome the problem of resistance to tetracycline, an antibiotic that has become less effective due to overuse. Paratek estimates that its drug could eventually treat nearly 900,000 hospitalized US patients annually. The drug, also known as omadacycline, is the first in a new class of antibiotics and is an updated version of tetracycline. Paratek created Nuzyra by tweaking tetracycline to block two common ways bacteria use to resist it. The FDA approved both an intravenous (IV) version and a daily pill that patients can switch to when they leave the hospital. Paratek plans to initially launch the antibiotic for use in hospitals, with eventual marketing for patients treated at doctors' offices and clinics. The company has not disclosed the price of Nuzyra. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that about 2 million Americans get infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria each year, resulting in 23,000 deaths. Last week, the US Health and Human Services Department announced a new global effort to fight antibiotic resistance and develop new treatments, with participation from drugmakers, government agencies, medical groups, and animal food producers.

609,"### Context: Nebraska state officials are expressing concern about the Nebraska Health Care Cash Fund, which covers various programs such as compulsive gambling assistance and biomedical research. The fund holds money from Nebraska's share of a 1998 settlement with tobacco companies, as well as excess Medicaid dollars. State investment officials have warned that the $477.8 million fund is at risk in the long term, as lawmakers are using both the principal and interest from its investment returns. Nebraska State Investment Officer Michael Walden-Newman sent a memo to lawmakers in September, predicting that the fund will decline steadily unless spending is reduced. He suggested capping withdrawals at no more than $54 million annually. In the last fiscal year, Nebraska distributed $62.9 million from the fund. Republican Governor Pete Ricketts expressed concern that the fund was being used for expenses other than its original purpose. A 2018 report found that states were spending only a small fraction of their tobacco settlement money on anti-smoking programs. Nebraska spent about $2.6 million on tobacco prevention programs last fiscal year, while the rest went to various programs such as reimbursement rates for behavioral health care providers and children's health insurance aid. Lawmakers voted earlier this year to pull an additional $500,000 a year from the fund to pay for community-based services for people with brain injuries. The chairwoman of the Health and Human Services Committee, Senator Sara Howard, argued against this proposal, stating that the fund needs to be preserved for future needs. She suggested replenishing the fund by raising Nebraska's cigarette tax. Lawmakers plan to convene a hearing in the fall to discuss the issue.

610,"### Context: The article discusses a 50 million pound ($80 million) research project launched by Britain's leading heart charity to investigate the potential of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue and ""mending broken hearts."" The article highlights that there is no mention of the cost of this type of therapy for patients and insurers, which could potentially make it only accessible to those with money. The article also criticizes the lack of information on the administrative costs of fundraising for the project.

The article points out that there is no quantification of the benefits or harms of the therapy, and no mention of potential risks or the time it may take to determine them. It criticizes the overly optimistic tone of the article and the lack of context provided for the studies mentioned, which were conducted on animals or in a lab, not in humans.

The article notes that the story does not quote any independent experts and only provides quotes from individuals associated with the British Heart Foundation (BHF), including Dr. Riley, who has conducted research in cooperation with a company seeking to commercialize regenerative treatments. The article suggests that the marketing materials on the BHF's website provide more information about alternatives to regenerative therapy than the story itself.

The article mentions that the BHF's website acknowledges that the human heart cannot heal itself and that the possibility of regenerative therapy is still a decade away. It criticizes the article for not making it clear that the research discussed has not been conducted on humans and that there are many clinical trials and regulatory hurdles to overcome before such a therapy would be available.

The article concludes by stating that while the story captures the enthusiasm surrounding the field of regenerative medicine, it fails to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research and the challenges that need to be overcome. It suggests that the story may have relied heavily on a briefing for a fundraising campaign and did not provide any outside perspectives.
Claim: Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"It’s hard to know how a charity hoping to raise money for stem cell research could have achieved a better marketing coup than landing this story on the Reuters wire. Millions of readers worldwide were guaranteed to have seen the charity’s slogan about how stem cells can “mend broken hearts” right in the headline and lead of the story. Even the campaign’s mascot — the zebrafish — makes an appearance. What they did not see was any challenge to the extravagant claims made about cardiac cell regeneration, any discussion of the undoubtedly sky-high costs that would be associated with stem cell treatments, or any analysis by independent experts of the quality of the evidence supporting this line of research. Just about 1 in every 50 Americans has heart failure with about 400,000 diagnosed every year. The prevalence increases with age and the number of people with it will rise as a result of increased life expectancy. Heart failure symptoms can be managed with drugs and, in extreme cases, dysfunction can be helped with implantable assistive devices. But there is no cure. So, the announcement by the British Heart Foundation to raise and spend $80 million on research into cardiac cell regeneration is important and newsworthy. Stem cell therapy, gene therapy, nanotechnology and numerous other futuristic sounding medical treatments are beloved by researchers and health writers alike, and there are promising lines of inquiry to be pursued. The trouble comes when writers attempt to translate the very difficult, complicated and sometimes frustrating scientific process for a general readership. Instead of taking a very long view and writing about these treatments as one of many possibilities for how heart medicine might evolve in the future, stories like this one present the treatments as being tantalizingly available “within the next decade.”",Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts,This story is about a new research initiative to develop a regenerative therapy for heart disease.

611,"### Context: The claim suggests that in November 2009, Donald Trump tweeted criticizing Barack Obama's handling of a pandemic and stating that he would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office. However, the article debunks this claim, stating that the tweet in question is not genuine and is a modern creation with a falsified date.

The article explains that in April 2020, an image gained traction on social media supposedly showing a screenshot of an old tweet from Trump. The tweet read: ""Obama's handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you're entirely to blame. John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office."" However, the tweet does not appear on Trump's timeline, nor is it included in the Trump Twitter Archive or Fact Base's archive of deleted tweets. The article further states that there is no record of this message prior to April 2020, indicating that it is a modern creation with a falsified date.

Additionally, the article points out that the text of the tweet contains nearly 300 characters, while in November 2009, Twitter had a limit of 140 characters per tweet. This further supports the claim that the tweet is fake.

However, the article acknowledges that Trump has made similar comments on Twitter. In November 2013, he tweeted that leaders are always responsible no matter what happens. This suggests that while the specific tweet in question is not genuine, Trump has expressed similar sentiments regarding leaders' responsibility during a crisis.

In summary, the claim that Trump tweeted in November 2009 criticizing Obama's handling of a pandemic and stating that he would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office is false. The tweet in question is a modern creation with a falsified date, and there is no record of it prior to April 2020. However, Trump has made similar comments on Twitter in November 2013, emphasizing leaders' responsibility during a crisis.

612,"### Context: The article reports on a claim made by a fake news site called Thug Life Videos that a Canadian man named Kenneth Gillespie was hospitalized for penile frostbite after attempting to have sexual relations with a snowman while drunk. The article states that Gillespie was found passed out clutching his frozen genitals and was rushed to the hospital. The doctor in charge of Gillespie said that frostbite in that area is serious and can lead to infection and gangrene, ultimately resulting in amputation. The article also mentions that some people in Gillespie's neighborhood were angry about what he did to the snowman and threatened to harm him. 

However, it is noted that similar claims had been published several years earlier by other sources, such as Uproxx and The Frisky, which are not considered fake news sites. These earlier versions of the claim placed a man named Kenneth Guillespie in Britain and did not mention the reference to Bill Cosby. The article also mentions that the original source of the claim was a now-deleted page on a website called Busted in Acadiana, which featured a photograph of a news article supporting the claim. The source of the claim, Sunday Sport, is described as a peddler of complete fabrications.

In summary, the article reports on a claim made by a fake news site that a man named Kenneth Gillespie lost his penis to frostbite after a drunken encounter with a snowman. However, it is noted that similar claims had been made earlier by other sources and the original source of the claim is known for publishing fabricated stories.

Defenders of the paper pointed out that it was not intended to be taken seriously.",An habitual alcohol abuser lost his penis to frostbite after a drunken sexual encounter with a snowman.,The image of a news article that purportedly reported on a man losing his penis to frostbite after a drunken sexual encounter with a snowman was created by a fabricator of fake news.
613,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by the Hal Turner Radio Show that the coronavirus is a military bioweapon developed by China's army. The show provides two screenshots from a national database of genetic material as evidence. However, the claim is flagged as misinformation by Facebook and has been shared over 2,000 times.

The World Health Organization reports that the coronavirus has rapidly spread around the world since its outbreak in Wuhan, China in December. PolitiFact has fact-checked various conspiracy theories about the source of the virus, including the claim that it escaped from the Wuhan lab. However, there is no evidence to support these claims, including the one made by the Hal Turner Radio Show.

The show claims that two coronavirus entries in a federal database with similar proteins are the same virus. However, this is unproven. The article explains that there are seven kinds of coronaviruses that can infect humans, and they have similar envelope proteins. Therefore, the match between the two entries does not prove that the viruses are the same.

The second claim made by the Hal Turner Radio Show is that the coronavirus is a military bioweapon because Chinese researchers uploaded its genetic information. However, this claim is also unproven. While there is a lab near Wuhan that deals with dangerous pathogens, China denies having a biological warfare program. The U.S. State Department has raised concerns about China's potential noncompliance with the Biological Weapons Convention, but officials are still working to determine the source of the outbreak.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Chinese authorities have isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus. Their findings suggest that it likely emerged from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus. The disease is believed to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan and has since spread to 24 countries. Researchers think the virus initially spread from animals to humans and is now spreading from human to human.

In conclusion, the claim made by the Hal Turner Radio Show that the coronavirus is a military bioweapon developed by China's army is inaccurate. The evidence provided by the show, including the screenshots from a genetic material database, does not support this claim. Additionally, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the virus was developed as a bioweapon.
Claim: Hal Turner Radio Show Says the coronavirus is “a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army.”

614,"### Context: The article discusses a warning about the harmful chemical benzene, which is linked to cancer, particularly leukemia. The warning claims that benzene can accumulate inside parked vehicles and suggests that drivers should roll down their windows to ventilate the car's interior before turning on the air conditioner.

The American Chemical Society released a report in 2007 stating that the interiors of motor vehicles contain a wide variety of synthetic materials that emit volatile organic compounds. However, the investigation concluded that there was no indication of these emissions being a health hazard in parked motor vehicle indoor air.

Benzene is a colorless liquid with a sweet smell that evaporates when it comes into contact with the air. It is present in cigarette smoke, car exhausts, glues, and paints. Breathing in high doses of benzene can cause difficulty in thinking, changes in heart function, unconsciousness, or even death. In smaller amounts over longer periods of time, benzene can decrease the formation of blood cells and is considered a cancer-causing chemical.

Exposure to benzene can occur through consuming contaminated food or beverages, but most people come into contact with it by breathing it in the air. Benzene can get into the air from forest fires, car emissions, gasoline vapors, and tobacco smoke. People who work with petroleum products, including gasoline, are also exposed to benzene through touch or inhalation.

The warning mentioned in the claim may have been sparked by a report from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in 2001. The report found high levels of air toxic emissions in new motor vehicles for up to six months and longer after leaving the showroom. However, the research was conducted on three Australian automobiles and one imported vehicle, with the origin of the imported vehicle not revealed.

In conclusion, while benzene is a harmful chemical linked to cancer, the claim about airing out car interiors to prevent benzene buildup may be overblown. The American Chemical Society's report found no apparent health hazard in parked motor vehicle indoor air. It is important to be aware of benzene exposure and take necessary precautions, but the specific warning mentioned in the claim may not be supported by current evidence.

615,"### Context: A recent study has found that a heart hormone called ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) may play a role in activating brown fat, which is known to burn calories. The study, conducted on mice and six human volunteers, showed that ANP increased the activity of brown fat and led to weight loss in the mice. The researchers believe that if ANP behaves the same way in humans, it could potentially be used as a weight loss treatment.

Brown fat is a type of fat that burns calories to generate heat. It is typically found in small amounts in adults, but it is more abundant in infants and hibernating animals. Previous research has shown that activating brown fat can increase metabolism and potentially help with weight loss.

The study involved injecting ANP into mice and measuring the effects on brown fat activity. The researchers found that ANP increased the activity of brown fat and led to weight loss in the mice. They also found that ANP increased the expression of genes associated with brown fat activity.

The researchers then conducted a small pilot study on six human volunteers to see if ANP had similar effects in humans. They found that ANP increased the activity of brown fat in the volunteers, suggesting that it may have the same effect in humans as it does in mice.

While the results are promising, the researchers caution that more research is needed to determine if ANP can be used as a weight loss treatment in humans. They also note that ANP is elevated during heart failure and cancer-related wasting, which may have adverse effects on weight loss.

Overall, the study suggests that ANP may hold the key to an effective weight loss treatment by activating brown fat. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the safety and effectiveness of ANP as a weight loss treatment.

The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"There’s no denying our collective interest in treatments that will magically burn fat without requiring us to eat less or get off of our couches. And we’ll grant that the “brown fat” discussed in this story is scientifically intriguing in that it seems to burn calories rather than storing them as garden-variety “white fat” does. But we think it’s far too soon to be touting a group of heart hormones as holding “the key to an effective weight loss treatment” merely because they increase brown fat levels in a single study conducted in mice. Although the story did introduce some caveats, they came too late to counterbalance the overoptimistic tone of the coverage. How long will it be before supplement marketers start touting pills that “activate brown fat” based on this very preliminary research? Oh, wait– they already are.",Heart Hormone Linked to Calorie-Burning Brown Fat,"This news release describes a study that found that a hormone called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increases the activity of brown fat, which in turn increases metabolism.

617,"### Context: According to Andy Jones, director of the state Office of Substance Misuse and Addiction Prevention, preliminary data shows a decrease in opioid-related overdose deaths in Alaska. In 2017, there were 100 opioid-related overdose deaths, while in the following year, there were 58. Jones believes that this indicates that the steps being taken to address opioid abuse in the state are working. However, he also acknowledges that there is still more work to be done.

In response to the opioid crisis, Alaska has implemented various measures. Then-Governor Bill Walker declared opioid abuse a public health disaster in 2017, and the Legislature approved the issuance of a standing medical order for a naloxone distribution program. Naloxone is a medication that can help prevent overdose. The state has also passed a law addressing opioid prescriptions and has sued opioid manufacturers. Additionally, Alaska has taken steps in prevention, treatment, and enforcement.

The state's response to opioid abuse has come at a cost of $210.9 million over the past two years. This includes federal funds, substance abuse treatment and recovery grants, prevention grants, and treatment costs within the Department of Corrections. It is worth noting that 80 percent of individuals in Corrections custody have substance abuse issues.

While the focus has been on opioids, Jones emphasizes the importance of looking at substance use disorders more broadly. Alaska also faces issues with alcohol, which remains the state's biggest problem. Michael Duxbury, deputy commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, highlights that these issues hinder the creation of healthy and safe communities that can thrive and prosper.

In related news, UnitedHealthcare announced steps it is taking nationally to address opioid concerns in dental plan coverage. The company will cap first-time opioid prescriptions written by dental health professionals for individuals aged 19 and younger at three days. Policyholders with dependents between 16 and 22 years old will receive information about the risks associated with opioids, particularly in relation to wisdom teeth extraction. UnitedHealthcare notes that dental health professionals make up the top 10 percent of opioid prescribers in their network.

Overall, while there has been a decrease in opioid-related overdose deaths in Alaska, there is still more work to be done in addressing substance abuse issues. The state's response has come at a significant cost, and efforts are being made to address opioid concerns in dental plan coverage.

618,"### Context: The article discusses a news release about a study that found a potential link between estrogen therapy and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease in recently postmenopausal women. The news release summarizes the study's findings that women who received estrogen via a skin patch had lower amyloid depositions in their brains compared to those who took estrogen orally or received a placebo. However, the release does not provide any numerical or statistical information about the strength of this association.

The study focused on women who were five to 36 months past menopause, primarily in their 50s, which is different from a previous study that found an association between estrogen use and an increased risk of dementia in women over 65. The potential long-term effects of estrogen use by younger women are not mentioned in the release.

The release also fails to mention the well-known small increase in the risk of breast cancer and blood clots associated with estrogen use. It also does not acknowledge that estradiol, the form of estrogen used in transdermal patches, increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer.

The study design is briefly described in the release, but it does not highlight the randomized and blinded nature of the study. The release mentions that the lead study author suggests the need to replicate the study with larger samples to confirm the findings, but it does not address the larger question of whether reducing amyloid has any effect on Alzheimer's symptoms or risk.

The release does not exaggerate the condition, stating that declines in estrogen associated with menopause ""may"" be associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, it does not provide enough information about the robustness of this relationship or the evidence supporting it.

The release appropriately identifies the funders and the lead study author. It does not mention other approaches available to postmenopausal women for reducing Alzheimer's disease risk, which is reasonable considering the focus of the study. The findings address an intermediate endpoint, amyloid deposition, rather than the disease itself.

Overall, the release implies a causal relationship between estrogen therapy and reduced Alzheimer's risk, which is not adequately supported by the information provided. The language used in the release is straightforward and the lead author's priority claim seems justified.
Claim: Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women May Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"A small pilot study has found that giving recently postmenopausal women estrogen via a patch is associated with reduced depositions of amyloid in the brain (a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) relative to women who received estrogen orally or who took a placebo. Additionally, the study found that the association was strongest among women with a greater genetic risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The study was carefully done, and the news release offers some useful details about the study’s methods. However, the study included just 68 women, too few to make the patterns found reliable. To its credit, the release quotes the lead author about the need for larger replications. But that begs the question of why the Mayo Clinic seeks to publicize this work at all, particularly with a news release headline that emphasizes disease reduction potential, when the study only looked at amyloid levels, a risk marker. There is very active debate as to whether lowering amyloid will have any impact on actual symptoms or rates of Alzheimer’s disease. A better headline might have been: “Pilot Study Suggests Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women Reduces Amyloid, Marker of Alzheimer’s Risk.” Journalists certainly deserve to know about this study, but they need to keep it in their back pockets until more rigorous clinical studies have been done. Whether estrogen replacement therapy is of value to postmenopausal women is contested territory, and researchers, including those in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study from which this research stems, are trying to explore the contingencies, if any, that distinguish women who could benefit from estrogen supplementation from those who may not. This study adds to a body of work looking at the “timing hypothesis,” that is, the notion that estrogen has different effects in the heart and brain when given to younger postmenopausal woman compared to women in their 60s or 70s. Studies of effects on the heart using intermediate disease markers (carotid artery thickness, analogous to heart disease in the way that amyloid deposition is to Alzheimer disease) in lieu of clinical outcomes (heart attacks, cognitive impairment) have been appearing in journals over the past two years. Considered in this context, the research is of interest but needs to be shared with a strong dose of qualifiers.",Estrogen Patch in Newly Postmenopausal Women May Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk,"This news release describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 400 recently menopausal women that found that those who received estradiol via a skin patch had lower amyloid depositions in their brains compared to those who took estrogen orally or received a placebo.

619,"### Context: The article discusses the claims made in a news release about a diet plan called ""The Baseball Diet."" The release states that the materials for this diet plan cost almost $50, including shipping, and argues that this price should have been included in the release. The release implies that the food cost of the diet would not be substantially more expensive than the dieter's regular diet, but this cannot be confirmed without reviewing the plan materials. The release also mentions that the author of the diet plan lost 70 pounds 12 years ago, but it appears that his weight loss was the result of techniques discussed in an earlier book, not the specific methods pitched in this release. The release also mentions Lou Piniella, a celebrity, but does not provide any data about his results with the diet plan.

The article points out that the release claims that ""The Baseball Diet"" will produce results within nine weeks, but notes that a diet plan should help people maintain lower weight indefinitely to improve health. The release does not discuss any potential harms of the diet plan. The release asserts that a simple and realistic diet is more likely to help people form new habits, but does not provide evidence to support this statement or show that this diet plan actually helps buyers form new habits.

The article also mentions that weight loss is recommended for most Americans and that most diet plans fail to deliver long-term benefits. It questions whether the celebrity quoted in the release, Lou Piniella, was paid for his endorsement and notes that there is no specific comparison to other weight loss programs or approaches. The article concludes by stating that the materials for ""The Baseball Diet"" are currently for sale and that the release makes vague statements about the program being simpler and more fun, but does not present any evidence to support these claims.

This has left millions of people stranded at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday. France has reported two cases of the virus, the first in Europe, and more cases are expected. The city of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified, is in virtual lockdown, with flights canceled and main roads blocked. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday. The virus has already spread to other countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases. Airports around the world are screening passengers from China. The virus is causing alarm due to many unknowns, such as its level of danger and how easily it spreads. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients with pre-existing medical conditions. As of Thursday, China has reported 830 confirmed cases and 26 deaths. The virus is believed to have originated in a market in Wuhan that traded illegally in wildlife. China has suspended transportation in 10 cities in the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located. The country will take further measures, but no details have been provided. The Lunar New Year celebrations raise fears that the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel to see family. As part of the restrictions, sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed, and Shanghai Disneyland will also close. Film premieres have been postponed, and McDonald's has suspended business in five cities in Hubei province. The World Health Organization has not yet designated the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Some experts believe the virus is not as dangerous as previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS. Three international research teams have begun work on vaccines. The outbreak has caused market turmoil and fears of a drop in demand from China.

621,"### Context: The article discusses the use of the drug Lupron as a therapy for autism. It mentions that Lupron costs about $5,000 a month but is rarely covered by insurance. The article cites claims from a Maryland researcher who believes that Lupron can remove mercury and excess testosterone, which he believes are linked to autism. However, the article also includes statements from numerous physicians, researchers, and therapists who insist that there is no proof that mercury causes autism or that Lupron removes mercury or excess testosterone.

The article dedicates a significant portion of the discussion to potential harms from using Lupron as an autism therapy. It mentions that the Maryland physician promoting this theory published studies claiming that autistic children taking Lupron showed improvements in awareness, sociability, and behavior. However, other doctors criticized these studies, stating that they were small, not scientifically sound, and published in journals that do not follow standard review practices.

The article does not engage in disease mongering and includes quotes from several independent expert sources. It also acknowledges that untested autism treatments have become prevalent. The article notes that Lupron is already used to treat endometrial cancer and prostate cancer, but it does not directly address its current off-label use for autism therapy. The article mentions that this therapy is being promoted by a Maryland medical group in South Florida, but it does not provide information on whether it is being tried elsewhere.

Overall, the article does not rely on a news release and is considered strong enterprise reporting. It does not make inordinate claims of novelty, as the Maryland researcher has been testing this therapy for at least five years.
Claim: Castration Drug Used as Autism Therapy
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"A new and uNPRoven approach to autism pops up in a local community. A reporter and his newspaper have several choices:   Accept the claims of the promoters at face value Ignore the issue entirely. Dig in, scrutinize the claims, and attempt a public service by evaluating the evidence for local readers. Thankfully, this reporter and this paper chose #3. The story quotes the mother of two developmentally disabled children saying:  ""These people are preying on the fears of parents. We cannot be using these children who are so vulnerable as guinea pigs in a medical experiment."" And it quotes a developmental pediatrician saying """,Castration Drug Used as Autism Therapy,"This is a well-reported story about a little-known but increasingly popular treatment for autism. The story does a good job of explaining the treatment, its potential harms, and the lack of scientific evidence to support it. The story also does a good job of explaining the treatment’s availability and its novelty. The story could have been improved by explaining the treatment’s costs and by making it clearer that the treatment is not new, but that it is being promoted more widely now. The story’s most significant flaw is that it relies too heavily on the claims of a single physician who is a paid consultant of the medical group that is promoting this treatment. The story should have included more independent voices."
622,"### Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) has accused the Tanzanian government of refusing to share the results of its investigations into patients with Ebola-like symptoms and refusing to send patient samples to an outside WHO partner lab. The government of Tanzania has claimed that it has no Ebola cases. The WHO was informed on September 10 of the death of a patient suspected to have Ebola in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's commercial capital. Unofficial reports later indicated that an Ebola test had come back positive. On Thursday, the WHO received unofficial reports that a contact of the patient, who had traveled widely in the country, was sick and hospitalized. The lack of information from Tanzania has made it difficult for the WHO to assess potential risks. The Ebola outbreak in neighboring Congo has infected over 3,000 people and killed nearly 2,000. A few cases have also been confirmed in neighboring Uganda. Health officials have previously expressed concerns about the suspected Ebola cases in Tanzania, and the US health and human services secretary has criticized the lack of transparency in the country. Critics have raised alarm as the Tanzanian government has restricted access to information and cracked down on perceived dissent. The government recently passed an amendment to a statistics law that criminalizes the distribution of information not sanctioned by the government or that contradicts the government. The World Bank has expressed concern about this amendment.

623,"### Context: On June 4, 2020, during a lunar eclipse, lightning struck the Washington Monument in a manner that resembled the Tower tarot card. The claim that the monument was struck by lightning during the eclipse is accurate, although some posts mistakenly claimed it happened on June 5. The lightning strike was captured in a video, and it was reported that two National Guard members were injured in a separate lightning strike that same night. The injuries were not life-threatening. The Washington Monument is frequently struck by lightning, with its aluminum crown being melted down from multiple strikes per year. The monument's rod system is designed to protect it from damage caused by electrical storms. The Tower tarot card is often seen as ominous, representing upheaval and major change. The card depicts an obelisk or tower similar to the Washington Monument, a lightning bolt, and people falling from the tower. The lightning strike on the monument resembled the imagery of the Tower card. Overall, the claim that lightning struck the Washington Monument during a lunar eclipse in a manner similar to the Tower tarot card is true.

624,"### Context: In December 2017, a college student named Julia Hass posted on social media that elephants have a natural affinity for and affection toward humans, comparing it to how humans find puppies cute. Hass clarified that she is not a scientist and based her statement on a Google search. The tweet gained traction and went viral, with Hass receiving thousands of likes and trending on various platforms. The popularity of the tweet can be attributed to people seeking positivity during a time of animosity and conflict. Hass mentioned that she did not face any harassment or negative experiences as a result of her tweet, and some people even helped her raise money for charity.

The claim that elephants think of humans as ""cute"" is supported by the fact that humans in parts of Asia have been able to tame elephants for thousands of years. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations described the relationship between elephants and humans as ""quite strange,"" noting that while some elephants easily form intimate bonds with their keepers, others remain hostile and ready to harm humans. However, domesticated elephants can be gentle and intelligent enough to be trusted with human infants.

A study conducted by researchers at the University of California-Davis in April 2017 observed the interactions between elephants and humans at Knysna Elephant Park in South Africa. The study recorded the ways a seven-elephant herd treated their handlers, volunteers, and tourists. The researchers found variations in the types of interactions, suggesting that elephants have different relationships with different individuals.

Overall, the article supports the claim that elephants think of humans as ""cute"" in a similar way that humans find kittens or puppies cute. The popularity of the claim on social media can be attributed to people seeking positivity and the need for a break from animosity and conflict.
Claim: Elephants think of humans as ""cute,"" in the same manner that humans think of kittens or puppies.

625,"### Context: The article addresses the claim made by Michele Bachmann that President Obama ""stole"" over $500 billion from Medicare to fund Obamacare. The article explains that the new health care law does not cut current funding for Medicare but rather attempts to slow the program's future growth. The law reduces anticipated spending increases by just over $500 billion over the next 10 years. The savings come from various sources, including reducing annual increases in payments to health care providers, increasing premiums for higher-income beneficiaries, administrative changes, and changes to the Medicare Advantage program. The article clarifies that the money was not ""stolen"" but rather Congress passed the law through its normal process, and the cost reductions for Medicare were openly discussed during the negotiations. The article concludes that while there is some truth to Bachmann's statement that future savings from Medicare are used to offset new costs created by the law, her use of the word ""stole"" is deceptive and undermines her argument.

626,"### Context: The article discusses various misconceptions and myths in the fitness industry. One common misconception is that weight training will make women bulky, but experts explain that this is not true unless they consume extra calories or take testosterone supplements. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends muscle-strengthening activities for adults, as working on lean muscle tissue burns more calories in the long run. Another myth is that lower-intensity exercise is better for burning calories, but increasing intensity actually leads to more calorie burn. The article also mentions that it is not necessary to exercise every day and that expecting days without exercise is realistic. It is a myth that fat can be moved away from problem areas, as overall fat reduction is necessary before targeting specific areas with resistance training. Crunches are not effective in banishing belly fat, as building a six-pack requires a proper diet. Stretching before exercise is not always beneficial, as it depends on the individual and the type of exercise. Lastly, the article debunks the myth that muscle can turn into fat, explaining that they are two different types of cells. Additionally, drinking excessive amounts of water can lead to a condition called hyponatremia, which is an imbalance of water to salt and can be dangerous.

627,"### Context: The Vashon Island School District in Washington has seen a significant increase in the number of fully immunized children, challenging the island's reputation as a hotbed of anti-vaccine sentiment. The number of kindergartners who received the required set of state-mandated vaccines increased by 31% in the past six years, from 56% to nearly 74% in the 2017-18 school year. This increase is attributed to the availability of pro-vaccine information, expanded access to shots, and media coverage of measles outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and New York. However, the Vashon school district still has one of the lowest vaccine rates in the US, far below the 95% target needed for herd immunity. Many Vashon parents choose to selectively vaccinate their children, opting for some vaccines but not all and spacing them out over a longer period of time. While the number of philosophical exemptions has decreased, there are still 11.6% of students whose families elect not to vaccinate, which is five times higher than the national median rate. The island's progress in increasing vaccination rates is unusual given the deep-rooted anti-vaccine sentiment in the community. The school nurse, along with Neighborcare Health clinics, has been working to remind families about vaccines and address their concerns. The health center at the high school, partly funded by a county grant, has been successful in providing free shots and services for low-income or uninsured students. The center has seen a spike in calls from concerned parents amid a measles outbreak in Washington state. The outbreak prompted the governor to eliminate personal or philosophical exemptions for the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Critics argue that the Vashon school system's data may not be representative of the population due to the presence of off-grid families. However, the data from a previous islandwide survey aligns with the public school data, indicating that the increase in vaccination rates is significant. The top service provided at the student-based health center is vaccinations, which surprises many given the island's reputation as a place where nobody vaccinates.

628,"### Context: State chapters of the American Medical Association and other healthcare provider groups are urging governors to provide legal protection for decisions made in emergency rooms during the COVID-19 crisis. Emergency room doctors and nurses are concerned about liability as they anticipate rationing care or performing unfamiliar jobs due to staff and equipment shortages. Governors in New York, New Jersey, and Michigan have responded by raising the standard for injuries or deaths while working in support of the state's response to COVID-19 from negligence to gross negligence. Physicians hope other states will follow suit. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse has introduced legislation to protect doctors who practice outside their area of specialty or use modified medical devices, as well as those who provide treatment outside standard healthcare facilities. Plaintiffs firms specializing in malpractice are monitoring how healthcare providers respond to the crisis. Doctors and nurses are worried about the lack of equipment and the obligation to resuscitate patients without the necessary ventilators. The increasing demand for hospital beds means doctors are unable to be as cautious as they normally would with non-coronavirus patients. Malpractice lawsuits can be costly, with insurance premiums exceeding $100,000 a year for some specialists. A malpractice law firm's website featured a blog post titled ""What you should know about medical negligence during the COVID-19 crisis,"" which drew criticism from healthcare professionals. Lawyers who represent patients argue that the law already protects medical professionals, as patients must show that a medical provider negligently deviated from the reasonable standard of care for the particular circumstances. However, doctors on the frontline of the coronavirus outbreak argue that the current liability rules may not be sufficient given the unprecedented nature of the crisis.

629,"### Context: China has agreed to allow the World Health Organization (WHO) to send international experts to study the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The decision came after a two-day visit by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials. The discussions focused on collaboration on containment measures in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, as well as public health measures in other cities and provinces. The WHO emphasized the urgent need for a better understanding of the virus' ability to spread from person to person in order to advise other countries.

The WHO and China also agreed to conduct further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, share data, and for China to share biological material with the WHO. This collaboration is crucial for developing vaccines and treatments. The two sides agreed that international experts from the WHO will visit China as soon as possible to work with Chinese counterparts in increasing understanding of the outbreak and guiding global response efforts. However, no specific time frame was given for the visit.

Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed confidence in China's ability to defeat the coronavirus, which has already claimed the lives of 106 people and spread to other countries, causing global concern and impacting financial markets. The WHO stated that its director-general, Tedros, can reconvene the WHO Emergency Committee on short notice to consider whether the outbreak constitutes an international emergency.

The statement from the WHO did not mention the discussions about evacuations of foreigners that were reportedly discussed during the Beijing talks. The WHO's independent panel met twice last week but did not declare a global emergency.

In summary, China has agreed to allow the WHO to send international experts to study the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The discussions between the WHO and Chinese officials focused on collaboration, containment measures, and the need for a better understanding of the virus' spread. The WHO emphasized the importance of sharing data and biological material to develop vaccines and treatments. Chinese President Xi expressed confidence in China's ability to defeat the virus. The WHO can reconvene its Emergency Committee to consider an international emergency if necessary.

630,"### Context: The article in question, posted by the far-right news and opinion website Freedom Daily, claims that Somali Muslim refugees have ""taken over"" the small town of Shelbyville, Tennessee and are targeting local Christians with ""violent Islamic crimes."" However, the article is filled with misinformation and false reporting.

The population of Somali refugees in Shelbyville is actually quite small. Over the past fifteen years, only 51 refugees have been resettled there, with the largest number in a single year being 11. This represents less than one percent of Shelbyville's total population. Furthermore, the Somali refugee population has actually decreased since 2015.

The article also quotes a former reporter for the local Shelbyville Times-Gazette, Brian Mosely, who describes a ""culture clash"" between the Somali refugees and the local residents. However, these remarks were made in 2009 and do not reflect the current situation in Shelbyville.

The article also mentions a series of violent crimes committed by Somali migrants, including the shooting of three churches. While these incidents did occur, the article falsely implies that Somali refugees were responsible. In reality, the sole suspect in the church shootings was Wendell Tobias Buchanan, who was not a Somali refugee.

The article also includes fake photographs, with one image supposedly showing downtown Shelbyville actually depicting the town of Bell Buckle, and another uncaptioned photograph showing the police response to a public disturbance actually taken after the 2015 Dylan Roof church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.

In conclusion, the article from Freedom Daily is a misrepresentation of the facts and relies on false reporting. The claim that Somali Muslim refugees have ""taken over"" Shelbyville and targeted local Christians with ""violent Islamic crimes"" is not supported by evidence.

631,"### Context: The claim that canned food in Thailand has been contaminated with HIV is false. Rumors about this contamination spread on social media, but there is no credible evidence to support these claims. In fact, the Royal Thai Embassy issued a press release in 2014 debunking the warning and stating that Thai canned products are thoroughly inspected and certified according to international standards. The heat treatment during processing eliminates all harmful microbes and viruses, including HIV. The head of the Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency also confirmed that there is no contamination. Similar messages were circulated in Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia in 2013. 

Warnings about food contaminated with HIV are not new and often prey on people's fear of contracting the virus. However, it is nearly impossible to contract HIV from blood injected into a fruit because the virus needs a human host to survive. HIV is a fragile virus outside of the body and cannot survive for long periods of time. As the blood dries, the virus dies and becomes harmless. Universal precautions should always be used, but these warnings about HIV-infected blood in foods are baseless and should be ignored.

632,"### Context: The claim that a federal judge has ordered the exhumation of Vince Foster's body to determine if Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved in his death is false. The claim originated from a satirical website called The Last Line of Defense, which clearly states that all articles should be considered satirical and cites facts that don't necessarily exist. The false report was quickly shared on social media over 20,000 times.

Vince Foster, a childhood friend of President Clinton, died in 1993 and his death was officially ruled a suicide by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. The investigation involved multiple lawyers, physicians, FBI agents, witnesses, and various tests. Foster reportedly suffered from depression and anxiety in his role as deputy White House counsel and blamed himself for the scrutiny the Clinton transition team faced. The FBI vault contains extensive documentation on the investigation into Foster's suicide, addressing specific questions that have fueled conspiracy theories.

The article falsely claims that a federal judge approved Congressman Trey Gowdy's request to exhume Foster's body. It states that evidence turned up in the case of a murdered reporter implicating Hillary Clinton in a 23-year-old crime, which coincided with Foster's supposed suicide. However, this information is from a satirical website and has no factual basis.

In conclusion, the claim that a federal judge has ordered the exhumation of Vince Foster's body to determine the involvement of Bill and Hillary Clinton in his death is false. The claim originated from a satirical website and has been widely shared on social media without realizing its satirical nature.

The release fails to mention the potential cost of the treatment, which would involve costly eye surgery and the manipulation of human skin cells to become stem cells. It also does not quantify the success of the experimental approach or provide any information about potential harms or risks associated with the procedure. The release equates the preservation of vision in laboratory rats to 16 years in humans, but this does not give any idea of the rate of effectiveness. The article also points out that the release does not mention the potential problems of nutrient supply interference and rejection of foreign cells, which are explained in the actual research paper. The release gives the impression that human use is close at hand, but the article argues that there is a huge leap between findings in lab rats and experiments in humans. The article also criticizes the release for not discussing alternative approaches or other research being done on age-related macular degeneration, which would provide important context for public comprehension. The release suggests that the treatment may be just around the corner, but the article argues that more work in animal models, FDA approval, and substantial clinical trials in humans will be needed, which could mean years of additional work before the procedure is available for people. Overall, the article concludes that the news release did not live up to the expectations it raised for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration.

",false,"While the findings described in this news release are enticing and hopeful, they were derived from animal studies, not human clinical trials. While the release eventually explains that, it went on to make crystal ball projections of being “close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.” Research efforts to manipulate pluripotent stem cells for use in various disorders, including retinal degeneration, are widespread and some forms of stem cell therapy using cells derived from embryonic stem cells, for instance, are already in human trials. The novel source of cells for this rat study is important, but this research does not stand alone. Even a little bit of context would have helped. Macular degeneration is a serious condition affecting millions of Americans each year. It is largely a disease of the elderly who slowly lose their central vision as cells in the back of eye die. Smoking, race and genetic predisposition can also affect the onset of this condition. The damage is irreparable but if a treatment could be possible through new research, it would provide an improvement in the quality of life for many people burdened by this condition.

The letter also states that three WHO experts must also leave, without providing an explanation for the expulsions. The WHO Africa regional chief, Matshidiso Moeti, described Mulombo as ""extremely competent"" and said the WHO was in communication with Burundi to understand the reasoning behind the decision. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) chief, John Nkengasong, called Burundi's action ""unfortunate"" and emphasized the need for coordination in the pandemic response. Burundi has 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19, but concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the numbers. The government has been accused of downplaying the virus and relying on divine protection, while rights groups have criticized the conditions and lack of access to quarantine facilities. Burundi is using virus restrictions to limit election observers, with any arriving foreigners required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. The election is scheduled for May 20, and the Africa CDC chief warned that holding a vote that allows the virus to spread could make containment extremely difficult. Burundi's previous election in 2015 led to deadly political turmoil, and critics fear further unrest if the results of this election are disputed. This is not the first time Burundi has expelled a United Nations official, as it previously expelled the U.N. human rights office and became the first country to leave the International Criminal Court.

635,"### Context: In July 2016, Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell posted an image on his Instagram profile that depicted an artist's rendering of a hooded man cutting the throat of a police officer. The image was accompanied by a message criticizing the use of weapons by police and expressing frustration over the deaths of black men at the hands of law enforcement. Crowell deleted the image shortly after posting it and issued multiple apologies, both through the Cleveland Browns and on his own Twitter account. He explained that he had been emotional about the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men who were killed by police officers, before the image was posted. Crowell emphasized that he did not condone violence against police officers and expressed his outrage and sadness over the attacks in Dallas, where five police officers were killed. He pledged to donate his first game check of the season to the Dallas Fallen Officer Foundation.

The Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association initially rejected Crowell's apology and threatened to refuse to provide security at home games unless he made a ""grand gesture"" of contrition. However, after Crowell released a video apology and made the promised donation, the association accepted his apology. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams also stated that Crowell had personally apologized to him and law enforcement in northeast Ohio, and he described the running back as ""contrite"" and ""apologetic.""

It is unclear why this incident has gained renewed attention more than a year later, but it may be related to the start of a new NFL season and the ongoing controversy over the national anthem. The article does not provide any further information about the current status of the image or Crowell's apologies on social media platforms.

636,"### Context: The article discusses a study that examined the effects of the drug Chantix on alcohol consumption. The study found that participants who took Chantix did not feel as good after drinking a low dose of alcohol compared to those who took a placebo. However, there was no difference in the effects of higher doses of alcohol. The study did not investigate whether Chantix actually helps people drink less voluntarily.

The article highlights that the headline and lead of the story focus on the possibility of Chantix curbing problem drinking, but the study did not specifically look at problem drinkers. The participants were heavy social drinkers who smoked, but they were not considered problem drinkers or addicted to cigarettes.

The article also mentions that Chantix carries a ""black box"" warning and raises concerns about depression, suicidal thoughts, and the risk of heart attacks and strokes. It notes that the study included only 15 people, but fails to remind readers of the limitations of drawing conclusions from such a small sample size.

The article switches between discussing background information on Chantix and alcohol consumption and the specific results of this study. It notes that it remains to be seen whether Chantix could be recommended to help problem drinkers, but the overall tone suggests that the drug could be useful, potentially encouraging people to try it even though the study does not provide evidence of its effectiveness in curbing alcohol consumption.

The article lacks information on alternative treatments for alcohol dependence, such as naltrexone, acamprosate, or disulfiram, which are already approved by the FDA. It also does not mention the role of behavioral and psychiatric treatments as alternative or adjunctive care for alcoholics.

The article includes an independent source but does not disclose any potential conflicts of interest among the researchers. It also fails to mention that Chantix is already available to help smokers quit and that other drugs are already used to treat alcohol addiction.

Overall, the article misstates the results of the study and does not provide a comprehensive view of the topic, potentially misleading readers about the effectiveness of Chantix in curbing problem drinking.

The story does provide cost and side effect information. Overall, this is making news out of a small study of the short-term (only hours) effects of a drug on the way alcohol affects human physiology. One could question the newsworthiness of this story about such a small, short-term study. News stories should make clear what’s news and what’s background. This story confuses things by trying to transform research into how people feel when they mix Chantix and alcohol into an advance in knowledge about how to reduce alcohol consumption, which this research did not test. Many alcoholics smoke. A magic bullet that helps both addictions would indeed be big news. While Chantix is probably effective in improving quit-rates among smokers, it has not been shown to affect drinking. This small, short-term study in humans is only a first step in exploring how Chantix might affect drinkers.",Stop-Smoking Drug May Also Curb Problem Drinking,"This story reports on a small study of a drug that is currently used to help people quit smoking. The researchers found that the drug, varenicline (Chantix), seemed to dull the pleasure that people got from drinking alcohol. The story does a good job of describing the study and the potential harms of the drug. However, the headline and lead of the story suggest that the drug may be effective in helping people cut back on problem drinking. But the study did not look at problem drinkers, and the results do not support the idea that the drug is effective in this way. The story also does not mention that there are other drugs and behavioral treatments that are already available to help people with alcohol dependence. The story also misstates the results of the study. The headline and lead suggest that the drug made people feel """"less good"""" after drinking. In fact, the study found that people who took the drug did not feel as good after drinking a low dose of alcohol, but there was no difference in the effects of higher doses of alcohol. The headline and lead also suggest that the study looked at people who were problem drinkers. The study included only 15 people, all of whom were heavy social drinkers who smoked, but were not considered problem drinkers or addicted to cigarettes. The story switches back and forth between discussing background information on Chantix and alcohol consumption and the specific results of this study. It’s not clear what the overall message is. It’s also not clear what the point of the story is. It’s not clear whether the story is trying to suggest that Chantix could be used to help people cut back on"
637,"### Context: A new study suggests that drinking coffee and tea may help prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. The study, which was published in the journal Diabetologia, analyzed data from 30 previous studies and found that people who drank three to four cups of coffee per day had a 25% lower risk of developing diabetes compared to those who drank less than two cups per day. Similarly, those who drank three to four cups of tea per day had a 20% lower risk. The researchers also found that decaffeinated coffee and green tea had similar effects. However, the study did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between coffee and tea consumption and diabetes prevention, as it was an observational study. The researchers believe that the beneficial effects of coffee and tea may be due to their high levels of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. They also noted that coffee and tea consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of other health conditions, such as heart disease and certain types of cancer. The study's findings support previous research that has suggested a link between coffee and tea consumption and a lower risk of diabetes. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal amount of coffee and tea to consume for diabetes prevention. The researchers also noted that adding sugar and cream to coffee and tea could negate the potential benefits. Overall, the study suggests that moderate consumption of coffee and tea may have a protective effect against type 2 diabetes, but further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between these beverages and diabetes prevention.

638,"### Context: The article discusses a controversial law in Arkansas that would expand the procedures that optometrists can perform. Currently, optometrists are not legally allowed to perform certain procedures that only ophthalmologists can do. However, optometrists in Arkansas successfully lobbied the state legislature to change the law and expand their scope of practice. This has sparked a heated debate between optometrists and ophthalmologists, with the latter arguing that the law will put patients at risk.

The Arkansas law would allow optometrists to perform procedures such as injections around the eye, removing lesions from the eyelids, and certain laser eye surgeries. The main point of contention is whether optometrists have the necessary training to perform these procedures. Optometrists complete a four-year program on eye care after college and are licensed by the state Board of Optometry. On the other hand, ophthalmologists are physicians licensed by the state Medical Board who have graduated from medical school, completed a yearlong hospital internship, and at least three years of residency.

Supporters of the law change argue that optometrists are already trained to perform the procedures and that forcing patients to see ophthalmologists poses a hardship, especially in rural areas where ophthalmologists are scarce. However, opponents, such as the group Safe Surgery Arkansas, believe that the procedures should be performed by medical doctors with surgical experience.

Similar legislation expanding optometrists' scope of practice has been proposed in other states, including Alaska, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. The debate over expanding the scope of practice for medical fields is not new, particularly in states where lawmakers are trying to improve access to care in rural areas. Doctors' groups often push back against such efforts, citing concerns about patient safety.

The lobbying fight over the Arkansas law has been expensive, with the Arkansas Ophthalmological Society spending over $111,000 to defeat the optometry expansion in the legislature. Safe Surgery Arkansas has spent over $150,000 gathering signatures to put a referendum on the law on the November 2020 ballot. The validity of the signatures is currently being verified by state officials.

In conclusion, the article highlights the contentious debate in Arkansas over a law that would expand the procedures optometrists can perform. The dispute between optometrists and ophthalmologists revolves around the question of whether optometrists have the necessary training for these procedures and the potential risks to patient safety. Similar debates are occurring in other states as policymakers seek to expand access to care and reduce costs.
Claim: Eye surgery law sparks unusually public dispute in Arkansas.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"As an optometrist in the small Arkansas town of Osceola, Dr. Matthew Jones must tell patients several times a week to seek treatment elsewhere — sometimes as far as an hour away — for procedures he says he’s fully capable of performing.",Eye surgery law sparks unusually public dispute in Arkansas.,"The Arkansas law has sparked an unusually public dispute between the two groups of eye doctors, with the ophthalmologists’ group, the Arkansas Society of Ophthalmology, and the optometrists’ group, the Arkansas Optometric Association, trading accusations in news stories and on social media."
639,"### Context: Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman has accused his Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her ""shady interests"" as a trial lawyer. Coffman's ad claims that Carroll's votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses"" to serve her own interests. However, an analysis of the claims reveals that the ad is misleading.

Carroll became an attorney in 2000 and primarily worked with her mother, representing clients with disabilities. She later worked for two personal injury law firms, specializing in personal injury, workers' compensation, social security disability, and employment law. Carroll's campaign spokesman clarified that she was primarily doing legal research at the firm until she took time off to focus on her congressional race.

Coffman's ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. The first is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman claims Carroll opposed to make it ""easier to sue"" doctors and nurses. However, Carroll voted against the bill in committee due to concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield medical professionals from liability in cases of gross negligence. She later voted for the bill after it was amended to grant immunity to medical volunteers, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or violent crimes.

The second bill, the Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013, was sponsored by Carroll. This bill allowed victims of employment discrimination to receive compensatory and punitive damages if it was proven that the employer engaged in intentional discrimination. The bill also allowed employees to be awarded attorney's fees and costs. However, if a lawsuit was found to be frivolous, the court could award attorney's fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages based on the size of the business.

Coffman's accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer is unfounded. There is no evidence of an ethics complaint against Carroll, and the legislature's ethics rules allow lawmakers to vote on bills that affect their profession as long as it also affects the entire membership of the class they belong to.

In conclusion, Coffman's claims that Carroll's votes made it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, and nurses are misleading. Carroll's votes actually made it harder to sue volunteer medical professionals unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Additionally, Carroll's bill on employment discrimination did not make it easier to sue small businesses but allowed for greater financial damages in cases of proven intentional discrimination. There is no evidence of Carroll violating state ethics laws.

But her bill did allow for the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees against employers of all sizes, including small businesses.

640,"### Context: Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen claimed that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times during his governorship. This claim was fact-checked and found to be largely correct. Christie has used his executive power multiple times to deny funding for family planning clinics, including those affiliated with Planned Parenthood. As a result, at least six clinics, including two Planned Parenthood clinics, have closed. The vetoes have been a point of contention between Christie and the Democrat-led Legislature. The timeline of the vetoes is as follows: in 2010, Christie vetoed a bill that aimed to restore $7.5 million in grants for women's health and family planning centers, including Planned Parenthood. In 2011 and 2012, he vetoed supplemental bills that sought to restore funding for family planning centers. In 2013, Christie vetoed a measure that aimed to restore $7.5 million for family planning services. Additionally, in 2011 and 2013, Christie vetoed proposals to expand the state's Medicaid program to cover family planning services. While the Medicaid expansion would not have directly provided money for Planned Parenthood, it would have allowed their health centers to see more patients and offer more services. Overall, Rosen's claim that Christie vetoed Planned Parenthood funding five times is accurate, although different interpretations may yield a slightly different number.

641,"### Context: The FDA has updated its warnings and prescribing recommendations for a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones. These antibiotics, including Cipro, Levaquin, and Avalox, have been associated with serious side effects such as tendon damage and rupture. The FDA issued a revised ""Boxed Warning"" in July 2016, stating that these antibiotics can cause disabling and potentially permanent side effects to the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system. The FDA also added a new warning and updated other parts of the drug label. 

The author of a blog post titled ""This Antibiotic Will Ruin You"" shared her personal experience with serious medical complications caused by fluoroquinolones. She experienced multiple spontaneous tendon and ligament ruptures, spinal degeneration, and widespread arthritis after taking Cipro for a urinary tract infection in 2010. While the author's personal story cannot be verified, the information presented regarding documented complications from fluoroquinolones is factual.

A 2015 review of adverse effects from fluoroquinolone antibiotics explained that these drugs have been extensively used to treat a wide range of infections since the 1980s. The exact mechanism by which fluoroquinolones may contribute to tendon damage is unclear, but it likely involves mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in tendon cells. The risks of tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, but the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. These risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids.

The FDA argues that the risk-to-benefit ratio of fluoroquinolones has shifted enough to merit limiting their prescription to cases of absolute necessity. The benefits of these antibiotics may outweigh the risks for some serious bacterial infections, but for conditions like acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, the risks generally outweigh the benefits.

Fluoroquinolones can also cross the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause psychiatric events, depression, and suicidal thoughts. A 2003 study estimated that psychiatric effects from fluoroquinolones occur in about 1.8 percent of cases, with most cases being minor and self-resolving. However, the recent changes to FDA warnings were not prompted by any new incidents or developments regarding mental health events.
Claim: The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Ultimately, any drug comes with potential adverse effects and discussing those risks versus the potential benefits with a doctor is wise. In the case of fluoroquinolones, there are indeed serious risks that need to be considered, especially when other classes of antibiotics may be effective.","The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture.","What's true: The FDA has issued revised warnings and prescribing recommendations for a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture.

642,"### Context: A recent study has raised questions about the necessity of removing all lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. The study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, found that there was no benefit to the more aggressive full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in women with T1 or T2 breast cancer. The study included 900 women and found that the five-year ""disease-free"" survival rate was 83.9% for those who did not have ALND, compared to 82.2% for those who did. The study also found that ALND did not decrease mortality rates.

The article highlights that the potential benefits of avoiding unnecessary surgery include lower costs for patients. However, it does not provide specific information on the incidence of complications such as infection or lymphedema after ALND, which would be important for patients to know.

The article does not mention that the study was a randomized trial, and it should have noted that the trial was stopped early after five years at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. The researchers also noted limitations of the study, including the failure to achieve the originally planned number of participants and possible randomization imbalance favoring the group that only had sentinel lymph node dissection.

The article includes quotes from an editorial accompanying the study, which referred to it as an ""important contribution"" and provided ""strong evidence"" that many women can safely forgo complete lymph node removal. A representative from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) characterized the study as ""practice-changing"" and suggested that ASCO may revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients with T1 or T2 tumors who have positive sentinel lymph nodes.

The article concludes by mentioning that many surgeons and oncologists base their advice on ASCO recommendations, so patients may soon be offered the option of the less extensive surgery based on the study's findings.

Overall, the study raises questions about the necessity of full axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer patients and suggests that the less extensive sentinel lymph node dissection may be a viable option. The article highlights the potential benefits of avoiding unnecessary surgery but lacks specific information on complications and the study's limitations.
Claim: Breast-cancer study questions lymph node removal
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Room for improvement:  Readers would have benefited from early clarity that all participants in the study still had a sentinel lymph node biopsy and that the research focused on whether removal of all lymph nodes was necessary if the sentinel nodes were cancerous. There was no discussion of cost impact of the findings, or about whether insurance might curtail coverage of lymph node dissection. There was no discussion of the researchers’ admission of what could be potentially important limitations in the research. The story didn’t explain how often complications of lymph node dissection occur. Women who have an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following a diagnosis of breast cancer, sometimes develop infections at the surgery site or lymphedema. Depending on its severity, lymphedema can be painful, disfiguring, and expensive to treat. While the symptoms of lymphedema can be treated, especially if caught early, once a person develops lymphedema, the person is always at risk for a recurrence of the lymphedema. If ALND confers no mortality or disease-free survival benefit, it may no longer be recommended as standard treatment for women with T1 or T2 breast cancer with positive nodes as determined by sentinel lymph node dissection.",Breast-cancer study questions lymph node removal,"This story reports on a study that found that removing all lymph nodes in the armpit of a woman with breast cancer is not necessary. The story does a good job of explaining the study and its implications. The story would have been stronger if it had included information on the costs of the two procedures and the incidence of complications from the more extensive procedure. The story also should have noted that the study was stopped early after 5 years at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. The researchers also noted limitations of the study, including the failure to achieve the originally planned number of participants and possible randomization imbalance favoring the group that only had sentinel lymph node dissection."
643,"### Context: The article examines the claim that every high school dropout costs the state of Rhode Island $72,000 over their lifetime. The claim was made by Robert G. Flanders Jr., chairman of the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education, during a budget summit. To investigate the source of this claim, the article refers to a report from Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies.

The report used data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to estimate the average earnings of high school dropouts from age 18 to 64. It also estimated the amount dropouts pay in taxes and the amount they receive in social welfare programs or spend on incarceration. According to the report, the average high school dropout costs society $440,214 over their lifetime, but they pay $367,867 in taxes. This results in a lifetime cost of $72,347, which aligns with Flanders' claim.

However, the article raises some concerns about the estimates. The Tax Foundation, a tax policy group, reports that state, federal, and local taxes amount to 27% of income, while the study estimates that dropouts and high school graduates pay 44% of their lifetime earnings in taxes. Additionally, a study by Cecilia Rouse, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, estimated the lifetime income difference between dropouts and graduates to be $260,000, much lower than the estimate in the report.

The article also highlights that the $72,000 figure includes lost tax revenue to the federal government, not just the state. It argues that Flanders' assertion of the figure with certainty is undeserved and that the numbers provided may only be rough approximations.

Despite the discrepancies and uncertainties, experts agree that dropping out of high school is detrimental to both individuals and society. Dropouts tend to have lower incomes, higher rates of criminal activity, and increased reliance on social services. While the exact cost may be difficult to determine, experts agree that preventing dropouts and promoting high school graduation is beneficial to the economy.

Flanders used that number, but he also said he was """"100 percent certain of it."""" Experts say he’s not. The numbers provided may only be rough approximations. Still, most experts agree that the number is in the ballpark. The question is, how certain can we be of the number? The answer is not very. The study that Flanders cited was based on a survey of 1,000 people, a relatively small sample size. The study also assumed that the income of dropouts and graduates would remain the same over their lifetimes, which is not guaranteed.

644,"### Context: Two new studies have shown that the use of the BioZorb implant can improve breast cancer treatment. The implant is a marker that helps physicians target radiation therapy more accurately. The studies found that the use of the implant resulted in cost savings of approximately 25% by allowing physicians to shift to a shorter course of radiation therapy. The patient outcomes remained similar, with benefits such as less radiation and better overall cosmetic outcomes. However, the news release did not provide quantified measures of these benefits.

The news release did not mention any potential harms, but the original article noted side effects in two patients. Skin changes and swelling were also concerns among patients, although they were not specifically tracked in the study. The release gave an overview of the three-year case series, which focused on 108 patients with early-stage breast cancer. However, the release did not mention the limitations of a case series with no control group, making it difficult to determine the true benefits of the implant.

The news release was provided by Focal Therapeutics, the maker of the implant. Although there was no mention of potential conflicts of interest in the release, the published study noted that one of the authors had a financial arrangement with Focal. The implant has received clearance from the FDA and is the first and only device of its kind on the market. However, it is unclear where the device is available and whether it is covered by most insurance plans.

Overall, the studies show that the BioZorb implant can improve breast cancer treatment, but the news release could have provided more specific information on the benefits and limitations of the implant.

646,"### Context: A recent study compared the effectiveness of dry needling and cortisone injections for hip pain. The study found that both treatments resulted in a decrease in pain and improved functionality for patients with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). However, the article does not provide specific information on the magnitude of these benefits. The study did not include a placebo group, making it difficult to determine how the treatments compare to normal healing without treatment.

The article mentions that the cost of a steroid injection ranges from $100 to $300, while dry needling is less expensive but requires more frequent treatments. Insurance may cover both treatments, but no specific cost information is provided.

The article notes that the study did not report any harms, but it fails to mention the potential side effects of dry needling, such as temporary pain, bruising, and post-treatment soreness. It also does not specify the potential harmful effects of steroids.

The study's methodology, number of patients, randomized assignment of treatment, and length of treatment are described in the article, providing readers with a good understanding of how the results were obtained. However, the article could have mentioned additional study limitations, such as a lack of blinding and the possibility of a placebo effect in both treatment groups.

The article states that GTPS affects 10% to 25% of the general population and is more common in women and patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. No conflicts of interest were mentioned in the article, and the funding for the study came from Baylor Scott & White Health.

The article adequately compares dry needling with cortisone injections but does not mention other strategies for managing chronic hip pain, such as physical therapy. It also does not provide details on what is involved in dry needling. Dry needling is typically performed by a physical therapist and requires more frequent treatments of about 20 minutes each.

Overall, the article provides a restrained and factual description of the study, but it lacks some important details and could have provided a more comprehensive analysis of the treatments and their potential benefits and drawbacks.
Claim: Dry needling offers alternative to cortisone injection for hip pain
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This news release from an orthopedics journal relates a study finding that dry needling, which uses filament needles to stimulate trigger points in the muscles, is just as effective as cortisone injections when it comes to reducing pain and swelling caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), a common hip condition. We applaud its restrained tone but would have liked to get a sense of how much symptom improvement patients experienced during the six-week trial as well as a discussion of costs and availability of these two treatment options. This release says the effectiveness of steroid injections “is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.” To conclude that dry needling is “not inferior” to a treatment that isn’t very effective doesn’t say much. There is no slam-dunk treatment for chronic hip pain. But if it comes with low risk and a modest cost, dry needling might be an alternative to steroids for combating chronic pain. Also, dry needling might offer an option for patients who haven’t felt relief from steroids or are precluded from taking them due to medication interactions. As the release states, GTPS is very common and at times very painful. A safe, successful treatment that rapidly resolves pain (beyond normal natural healing) would benefit many individuals. A specific risk profile of a single cortisone injection in the soft tissues has not been determined but most researchers and practicing physicians would consider it to be minimal.",Dry needling offers alternative to cortisone injection for hip pain,"This is a news release about a study comparing two alternative treatments for a common type of hip pain called greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). The study, published in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, found that both dry needling and cortisone injections were effective in reducing pain and improving function. The news release does a good job of describing the study’s methodology and quantifying the benefits of the two treatments. However, it fails to mention the potential harms of dry needling and doesn’t provide readers with a clear sense of the costs of the two treatments. It also doesn’t mention that the study didn’t include a placebo group, which makes it difficult to determine how much of the benefit is due to the treatments themselves and how much is due to the placebo effect. GTPS is a common type of hip pain that is often misdiagnosed as arthritis. It is caused by inflammation of the gluteal muscles and tendons, and is more common in women. The pain is often described as a dull, aching pain that is worse after periods of inactivity, such as waking up in the morning or sitting for long periods. The pain can also be made worse by activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and sleeping on the affected side. The pain can last for months or even years. The study described in this news release is important because it provides evidence that dry needling is an effective alternative to cortisone injections for managing chronic hip pain."

The article explains that the video uses words like ""role,"" ""audition,"" and ""casting call"" to paint Ocasio-Cortez as an actress and compares her to conspiracy theories like ""crisis actors"" and ""paid protesters."" However, the video's creator, Chris Kohls, clarifies that he did not mean to suggest that acting was Ocasio-Cortez's actual profession, but rather that she auditioned for the role of congresswoman in response to an open casting call by Justice Democrats.

The article points out that it is common for Political Action Committees (PACs) to recruit candidates for office, and the Justice Democrats openly discuss their recruitment process. Other PACs, such as Brand New Congress and Emily's List, also actively seek candidates for political positions.

The article also highlights that Ocasio-Cortez had an interest in politics before being recruited by Justice Democrats. She volunteered for Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign and was involved in the Standing Rock protests. Her alignment with the Justice Democrats' platform is evidence of a good fit, not proof of being controlled by them.

The video claims that Ocasio-Cortez does not make her own policy decisions and defers completely to her team. However, this is based on speculation and a misunderstanding of how politicians operate. Lawmakers have teams of people who help guide them through their political responsibilities.

Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, refutes the claims made in the video and states that she runs her own social media accounts, writes her own speeches, and actively participates in committee hearings.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that Ocasio-Cortez is an actress playing a congresswoman and highlights that the arguments made in the video are based on speculation and a misunderstanding of how PACs and politicians operate.

648,"### Context: Famed for his work exploring the origins of the universe, Hawking died in March at the age of 76 after spending most of his life confined to a wheelchair with motor neurone disease. Some of his belongings including essays, medals, awards and a copy of his book a “Brief History of Time” signed with a thumbprint were sold online on Thursday alongside letters and manuscripts belonging to Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein. Hawking’s 117-page dissertation “Properties of expanding universes” from 1965 sold for 584,750 pounds, well ahead of the estimate of up to 150,000. Medals and awards sold for 296,750 pounds, compared with an estimate of 15,000 pounds, while the red motorized wheelchair sold for 296,750 pounds, also compared with an estimate of 15,000 pounds. Auction house Christies ran the nine-day online auction called “On the Shoulders of Giants” to raise money for the Stephen Hawking Foundation and the Motor Neurone Disease Association. It also offered fans of the physicist known for his electronic voice synthesizer a chance to buy some of his possessions. “Stephen Hawking was a huge personality worldwide. He had this amazing ability to connect with people,” Thomas Venning, head of the Books and Manuscripts department at auction house Christie’s London, told Reuters ahead of the event.

649,"### Context: Seven Republicans joined all Democrats in rejecting a measure by GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky that would have repealed most of former President Obama’s health care law, with a two-year delay but no replacement. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that repealing “Obamacare” without replacing it would cost more than 30 million Americans their insurance coverage, and that was a key factor in driving away more Republican senators than Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could afford to lose in the closely divided Senate. The real-world implications of repeal have proven sobering to GOP senators answering to voters who’ve come to rely on expanded insurance coverage under the law. By week’s end Republicans hope to reach agreement among themselves, and eventually with the House, on some kind of repeal and replacement for the Obama law they have reviled for so long. One possibility taking shape in talks among senators was a “skinny repeal” that would abolish just a few of the key elements of Obama’s law including its mandates that everyone purchase insurance and its taxes that all GOP senators can agree to oppose. Either way, after weeks spent on the issue including false starts and near-death experiences that have eaten up months of Trump’s presidency, the realization was dawning on senators that they may be unable to pass anything more complex for now than a lowest-common-denominator bill. Senators were working their way through 20 hours of debate. At week’s end, a “vote-a-rama” of rapid-fire voting on a mountain of amendments was expected before moving to final passage — of something. Internal GOP differences remain over how broadly to repeal the law, how to reimburse states that would suffer from the bill’s Medicaid cuts and whether to let insurers sell cut-rate, bare-bones coverage that falls short of the requirements. While pressure and deal-making helped win over vacillating Republicans to begin debate, they remained fragmented over what to do next.

650,"### Context: In September 2019, a Reddit post claimed that Rolex's meticulous sales records were used to solve an open homicide case. The post stated that on July 28, 1996, a man's body washed up on a trawler in the UK seas, and the only identification found on the body was a 25-year-old Rolex Oyster watch. Rolex's service records were used to identify the victim as Ronald Platt and ultimately led to the conviction of Albert Walker for his murder.

The claim gained popularity on Reddit and was later reposted on Imgur. The story was then shared on Facebook without proper attribution. The original article that described Rolex's meticulous records was not linked in the Reddit post.

According to the article, Ronald Platt's body was found by a British trawler on July 28, 1996. The police found no other identification on the body except for the Rolex watch on his wrist. After researching Rolex's service records, the police were able to identify the victim as Ronald Platt, a former soldier. The watch had been serviced twice at a jeweler in the 1980s.

The article also mentioned that Albert Walker, a fugitive Canadian businessman, was convicted of Platt's murder in 1998. Walker had influenced Platt and his partner to relocate to Canada but Platt moved back to England in 1995, which disrupted Walker's plans. Walker used Platt and his partner as a front for a bogus company operation to launder cash. When Platt returned to England, he became a threat to Walker's security and freedom.

The Rolex watch played a crucial role in identifying Platt and leading the police to Walker. The watch's serial number and service records helped identify Platt as the owner. The watch also provided information about the date of death and the time of death within a small margin of error.

Additional forensic and forensic accounting work, along with the use of GPS navigation systems and DNA testing, helped solve the murder case. Walker's yacht's GPS system was used to establish its location near where Platt's body was found. Hairs found on cushions in the yacht's cabin were matched to Platt through DNA testing. Traces of zinc from the anchor and leather were also found on the anchor.

In conclusion, the claim that Rolex's meticulous sales records were used to solve an open homicide is accurate. The records helped identify the victim and played a significant role in the investigation, along with other forensic evidence.

651,"### Context: The U.S. Supreme Court has reversed a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ruling that the burden of proof in patent infringement cases lies with the patent holder. The case involves Medtronic, a medical device company, and Mirowski Family Ventures, the patent holder. Medtronic had asked a judge to rule that some of its pacemakers do not infringe on technology patented by Mirowski and licensed to Boston Scientific and Guidant Corp. The court in Delaware ruled in favor of Medtronic, stating that it was up to Mirowski to prove infringement. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit disagreed, stating that it was up to Medtronic to prove its case. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that the burden of proof lies with the patent holder. The two patents in question relate to cardiac resynchronization therapy, a pacemaker used to treat congestive heart failure. Medtronic had licensed the patents, but Mirowski claimed that Medtronic was developing new products that would require royalty payments. Medtronic filed a lawsuit seeking a ruling that it did not need to pay. With the Supreme Court's decision, the case will now return to lower courts for further proceedings, including a fight over infringement. The article notes that the burden of proof issue was not one of the more significant issues in the case, and that it will now go back to the Federal Circuit for other issues to be considered.

652,"### Context: The article discusses a study that claims a quick brain scan could be used to screen for autism. However, the article highlights several deficiencies in the study and argues that the story did not provide enough critical analysis. 

Firstly, the article points out that the study had a small and highly selected sample of patients, which may bias the results towards greater accuracy than what would be observed in a larger and more diverse sample. The article also criticizes the lack of acknowledgment that the study was conducted on adults, while the real need is for a diagnostic tool for use in children. The article argues that the outcome of the not-yet-done studies on children was treated as a fait accompli without sufficient discussion.

Furthermore, the article raises concerns about the potential harm of false-positive or false-negative diagnoses and the labeling of individuals with borderline symptoms as having autism. It also mentions that MRI with contrast, which was used in the study, is associated with kidney damage. The article argues that the story should have provided more detail and less unbridled optimism, discussing the limitations of the small study and the need for additional research to confirm the results.

The article also criticizes the story for not providing all the necessary information about the study's outcomes. It argues that diagnostic tests must not only identify individuals with a disease but also rule out those who do not have the disease and do not require treatment. Failure to accomplish the latter could result in an excessively high false-positive rate and unnecessary treatment of healthy people.

Additionally, the article questions the speculation in the story about applying the new technology to children. It argues that there are good reasons why the test might be less effective in the developing brain than in a mature one and criticizes the lack of skepticism in the discussion.

Overall, the article argues that the story did not provide enough critical analysis and failed to address important limitations and potential harms of the study. It also questions the optimistic prediction that the new scan could be ready for general use in a couple of years, arguing that such pie-in-the-sky guesstimates are usually wrong and should be avoided in health journalism.

653,"### Context: The South Australian Parliament rejected a bill that would have legalized assisted suicide in the state. The vote was close, with 24 votes against the bill and 23 in favor. If the bill had passed, South Australia would have become the only Australian state or territory to allow assisted suicide. The Northern Territory of Australia had legalized mercy killing in 1996, but the law was overturned by the Australian Parliament in 1997. The Australian Parliament has the power to overturn territory laws but not state laws.

The bill was introduced by an opposition lawmaker last month, and lawmakers were given the opportunity to vote according to their consciences rather than along party lines. The original bill required patients to have a terminal illness and to be suffering from unbearable pain that could not be relieved before they could access medical help to end their lives. They also needed to have their decision endorsed by at least two doctors. During the debate, several amendments were passed to tighten access to assisted suicide, including making mental health assessments mandatory.

South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill expressed disappointment at the defeat of the bill but was confident that a new bill would be introduced in the future. The major political parties in Australia do not have official positions on euthanasia, so lawmakers were able to vote freely on the issue.

The Australian Christian Lobby, a lobby group, welcomed the defeat of the bill. They described the amended bill as a ""cobbled-together compromise"" and argued that there are better ways to address suffering without resorting to state-sanctioned killing.

Overall, the article highlights the rejection of a bill to legalize assisted suicide in South Australia. It provides background information on the history of euthanasia laws in Australia and the specific requirements of the bill. It also mentions the role of the Australian Christian Lobby and their opposition to the bill.

John O’Bannon, R-Henrico, has asked his constituents whether Virginia should take action against Planned Parenthood in light of controversial videos about the extraction of fetal organs for research. Planned Parenthood has acknowledged that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to medical researchers and that the one in California has been getting reimbursed. Federal law bars organizations performing abortions from profiting from the sale of fetal tissue, but allows them to receive ""reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue."" O’Bannon’s statement that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling parts for profit is noteworthy because it accuses the organization of illegal acts. O’Bannon points to a series of secretly recorded videos in which anti-abortion advocates posed as officials of a fake biotech firm seeking to buy fetal tissue for research and met with Planned Parenthood officials. Planned Parenthood officials, under prodding from the undercover activists, said tissues probably could be obtained for $30 to $100 per sample. A medical ethicist says those fees seem to be a ""reasonable"" reimbursement for the cost of supplying the tissue. An investigation by Washington’s attorney general cleared Planned Parenthood of charges it was profiting from the sales in that state. Investigations in 11 other states also have cleared the organization.

Planned Parenthood acknowledges that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to researchers but says they comply with federal law barring a financial profit from the transactions. O’Bannon’s statement implicitly accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking the law, so there’s a burden on him to prove the organization profited from sales.

None are yet on the market. Novartis said it now plans two Phase III studies for ligelizumab with more than 2,000 patients who suffer from chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), an autoimmune disease that causes persistent itchy reddish welts on the skin. “Despite existing treatment options, too many people continue to struggle with the debilitating and potentially painful symptoms of CSU,” Marcus Maurer, a professor of dermatology and allergy at the Allergie-Centrum-Charite in Berlin, Germany, said in a statement from Novartis. Roche is also developing a new drug, fenebrutinib, to fight CSU and has a Phase II trial, with an expected filing date of after 2021, according to its website. Both companies are looking to develop a more advanced drug than Xolair as India’s Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has a biosimilar copy in the works.

656,"### Context: The claim that Tommy Robinson was jailed in order to silence his reporting on a sex abuse trial in England and to protect Muslim pedophiles is based on a wild misunderstanding of the legal system in the UK. Robinson was given a 13-month prison sentence for contempt of court and violating his existing suspended sentence. He had breached reporting restrictions placed on the news media and others in order to protect the due process rights of defendants and prevent the collapse of trials. The reporting restrictions in the child sexual abuse case were not designed to protect Muslim pedophiles, but rather to protect the integrity of the trial, prevent a costly retrial, and spare witnesses from having to testify again. Robinson's Facebook Live video, in which he confronted men he presented as defendants in the ongoing trial, had the potential to prejudice and collapse the trial. The judge ruled that Robinson's video was highly prejudicial to the defendants and could lead to a retrial, costing a significant amount of money and causing witnesses to go through the ordeal of testifying again. Reporting restrictions in the case were lifted after a successful application by a news outlet, demonstrating that restrictions only postpone, but do not prohibit, acts of journalism. The UK news media faces strict rules on what they can publish about ongoing trials, with the overarching principle being to avoid the publication of anything that creates a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the administration of justice. Therefore, the claim that Robinson was jailed to silence his reporting and protect Muslim pedophiles is unfounded.

657,"### Context: The article discusses a viral video that claims an ""African method"" can help people avoid contracting COVID-19. The video shows a young man sitting over a large cooking pot with steam emanating from it, promoting the idea that viruses cannot survive in heat. The video suggests that by creating a makeshift sauna with the powers of fruits and vegetables, the virus can break down and the person will develop antibodies to fight it.

However, health officials have warned against such claims. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including those with hot and humid weather. The WHO emphasizes the importance of frequent hand cleaning as the best way to protect against the virus.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health also debunked the claim that herbal therapies and teas can prevent or cure COVID-19. They state that there is no scientific evidence to support these alternative remedies and some may even be unsafe to consume.

The article mentions that at least 8,419 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed across 45 countries in Africa as of April 10, 2020. It also cites an analysis by Reuters debunking the claim that ""steam therapy"" is effective against COVID-19, as it can give a false sense of safety and carries a risk of injury.

658,"### Context: The article discusses the debate over the decriminalization and legalization of marijuana and the confusion surrounding the federal government's position on cannabis. The claim being addressed is that ""what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress."" The article explains that determining the classification of marijuana is technically a job for Congress, but the executive branch does have some control over it.

The Controlled Substance Act, passed by Congress in 1970, created five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics based on medical use and potential for abuse. Marijuana was included as a Schedule I substance, which means it has no accepted medical use and is considered the most dangerous class of drugs. Distribution, manufacturing, or possession of marijuana is a federal offense.

The article explains that Congress could amend the law to reschedule or exempt marijuana, but there is another way to lawfully reclassify it. According to the Controlled Substance Act, the attorney general, through the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), has the power to change the classification of a substance if it meets certain criteria. The DEA can request a scientific and medical evaluation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to determine if there are safe medical uses for marijuana. The FDA, under HHS, has continually stated that the scientific evidence for the medical benefits of marijuana is not sufficient for FDA approval.

Although the FDA's ruling serves as the basis for any action from the Justice Department, the Obama administration has found ways to work around it. In 2009, federal law enforcement agencies were told to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, and in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not target states that legalized recreational marijuana. This means that even though marijuana remains a Schedule I substance, the current administration has not always treated it as one under the law.

In conclusion, while determining the classification of marijuana is technically a job for Congress, the executive branch does have the power to reclassify it through a lengthy process involving the DEA and HHS. The FDA's recommendations are supposed to be based on science, but the Obama administration has found ways to work around the FDA's unwillingness to acknowledge the medical benefits of marijuana.

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Obama said ""what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress.""

659,"### Context: Post-war Liberians are demanding better mental health care as the country continues to struggle with the aftermath of civil wars and the Ebola outbreak. President George Weah has indicated that there is no need for a war crimes court in Liberia, which has frustrated many who believe that justice is necessary for healing. Hundreds of people stormed Liberia's legislature last month with a petition asking for more mental health support, arguing that private aid is not enough to ensure that every Liberian receives assistance. The World Health Organization has reported that over 20% of Liberia's post-war population has mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the country only has a couple of psychiatrists for a population of nearly 5 million. Until three years ago, there was only one psychiatrist in Liberia. The need for mental health care in Liberia is immense, but no government has been able to tackle the issue. Government authorities blame the country's inability to raise enough revenue to address mental health issues. The funding allotted to the health sector in the annual budget is negligible due to competing priorities. Collaboration with organizations like the Carter Center has helped the government provide basic mental health services, but more resources are needed. Dr. David Henderson, chairman of the psychiatry department at Boston University's medical school, suggests that global health funding should pay more attention to psychiatry in order to build capacity and address mental health issues more rigorously. Currently, Liberia has one overcrowded and underfunded mental health hospital, and a rehabilitation center for people with mental illness was looted during the civil war and has never reopened. The frustration with the lack of mental health care in Liberia is growing, and the government needs to prioritize this issue to ensure that every Liberian has access to the mental health support they need.

660,"### Context: A drug for refractory psoriatic arthritis has shown promise in a clinical trial. The drug, which is already on the market for another condition, has been found to have a response rate of 53.3% in reducing the number of tender and swollen joints. However, patients receiving the drug every two weeks did not fare any better and were slightly more prone to side effects. The cost of the drug was not provided in the article, but according to GoodRx, one 80 mg auto-injector of the drug costs around $4,700.

The trial lasted for 24 weeks and was a randomized, blinded, three-armed, multi-site study. Few serious adverse events were reported for patients receiving the drug or the placebo, but a close reading of the abstract reveals that 7% of patients taking the drug every two weeks had serious adverse events compared to 3% on placebo.

The article provides context on the condition of psoriatic arthritis and explains how the drug is believed to work. It also mentions alternative drugs like TNF inhibitors, which are already on the market but only help about half of psoriatic arthritis patients. Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, called secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.

The drug has been FDA approved and is available for patients with psoriasis. The manufacturer has applied for FDA approval for use in patients with psoriatic arthritis as well. The article does not claim novelty for the drug, but it appears to be the first randomized trial for this type of arthritis.

Overall, the article provides an adequate discussion of the drug's benefits and the trial's results. However, it does not provide information on the cost of the drug or list the major adverse events that occurred during the trial. It also does not mention the long-term effects of the drug beyond the 6-month trial period.

The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This relatively thorough news release summarizes the results of a 24-week randomized trial of the biologic drug ixekizumab (marketed as Taltz) in patients with psoriatic arthritis. While the release hits most of the key points that any journalist might ask when writing about this study, it offers too little discussion of harms and no mention of the drug’s cost. People with psoriatic arthritis often have painful, red, scaly patches on their skin and they may not be effectively treated with TNF inhibitors (drugs commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions). If only half of psoriatic arthritis patients get better with TNF inhibitors then another option would be most welcome for those that have found no relief. The drug under study, ixekuzumab, appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of joint tenderness and swelling, and if it can provide these benefits at a reasonable level of safety, this could be a great advance. At the same time, if the goal of treatment is to prevent long-term complications of psoriatic arthritis (severe joint and bone damage and functional disability), we are still left wondering if this potential new treatment represents a benefit beyond 6 months for psoriatic arthritis sufferers.",Drug for refractory psoriatic arthritis shows promise in clinical trial,"This is a news release about a drug that has been approved for psoriasis and is now being tested for psoriatic arthritis. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that targets the cytokine interleukin-17A. The release does a good job of describing the drug and the trial, and of putting the results in context. It would have been better if it had mentioned the cost of the drug, and the serious adverse events that occurred during the trial. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, disabling disease that affects about 1 million people in the U.S. It is a form of arthritis that is associated with psoriasis, a skin disease. The disease is characterized by inflammation of the joints, which can lead to joint destruction and disability. There is no cure for the disease, and treatment is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing joint destruction. The mainstays of treatment are NSAIDs and TNF inhibitors. The addition of a new drug to the treatment armamentarium would be a welcome addition."
661,"### Context: Male ring-tailed lemurs increase their attractiveness to females by secreting a fruity and floral aroma from glands on their wrists, according to a study published in the journal Current Biology. The behavior, dubbed ""stink flirting,"" involves the male rubbing the fragrant liquid on his tail and waving it at females. The researchers identified three compounds responsible for the scent, which they believe are strong candidates for sex pheromones. This is significant because no pheromones have been identified in any primates, including humans. The researchers also found a close relationship between the male hormone testosterone and the lemur odor compounds. The male scent only works during the breeding season when females are sexually receptive. Outside of the breeding season, the male gland secretions smell different and the females show little interest. Olfactory communication is important for ring-tailed lemurs, as they use scent glands to mark territory and designate social rank. Lemurs have a keener sense of smell compared to other primates.

For ring-tailed lemurs, it is the way to go.",'Stink flirting' is a thing - just ask a ring-tailed lemur.,"If you’re a male ring-tailed lemur, you’re not going to get very far with the ladies by just looking good and dancing around."
662,"### Context: The claim that ""Black Friday"" originated with the practice of selling off slaves on the day after Thanksgiving is false. The term ""Black Friday"" did not originate until nearly a century after slavery was abolished in the U.S. The earliest known use of ""Black Friday"" in this context was in 1951, referring to workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving to have a four-day weekend. 

The term ""Black Friday"" gained popularity in Philadelphia in the early 1960s when police used it to describe the traffic jams and chaos caused by shoppers heading to downtown stores on the two days after Thanksgiving. It eventually spread nationwide and became commonly used to describe the busiest shopping days of the year.

One alternative explanation for the origins of ""Black Friday"" is that it is the day when retailers finally begin to show a profit for the year, moving from being ""in the red"" to ""in the black"" in accounting terms. This theory suggests that the term refers to the financial success of retailers on this day.

Overall, the claim that ""Black Friday"" originated with the practice of selling slaves is false. The term actually originated in the 1950s and 1960s to describe workers calling in sick and the chaos caused by shoppers on the day after Thanksgiving.
Claim: The term ""Black Friday"" originated with the practice of selling off slaves on the day after Thanksgiving.

What's false: The term 'Black Friday' did not originate with the practice of selling off slaves on the day after Thanksgiving.
663,"### Context: The article discusses the success of a new drug called dupilumab in treating severe eczema. The price of the drug has not been set yet, but it is noted that it is a biologic drug, which is the most expensive type of drug and is injected every two weeks. The article mentions that a widely prescribed biologic treatment for Crohn's Disease, Humira, costs about $2,000 per dose or $50,000 per year. The article also states that ""most"" patients reported their itching disappearing within a few months and nearly 40 percent saw their rash disappear. However, the article does not provide specific percentages or compare the results to the placebo group.

The article highlights three patients who had positive results with the drug, but it fails to mention that these patients do not represent the majority of patients who did not see their rashes disappear or experience dramatic reductions in itching. Additionally, about one in five patients on the drug had to receive ""rescue"" treatment because their symptoms became unacceptable. The article does mention that patients receiving dupilumab reported more cases of conjunctivitis and swelling around the injection site compared to those receiving placebo injections. Some patients also saw their eczema worsen and reported upper respiratory infections, although the rates were similar to those receiving placebo injections.

The article provides key facts about the study design, number of patients, and duration of the trials. However, it does not mention that the trials did not include children, even though children are more likely to suffer from eczema. The article also does not address criticism of the type of primary endpoint used in the trials, which lacks standardized definitions and implementation.

The prevalence of ""uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe"" eczema mentioned in the article is in line with conservative estimates. However, the article fails to disclose that every statistic and expert quote is from sources funded by the companies seeking approval for dupilumab. The lone ""independent"" expert mentioned in the article, Dr. Mark Boguniewicz, received over $37,000 from Regeneron for consulting, speaking, and travel reimbursements last year.

The article notes that many creams and lotions fail to provide relief for severe eczema and that patients often try off-label treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or steroids, which can have serious side effects. It also mentions that the companies are seeking FDA approval for dupilumab, which has been given ""breakthrough"" status for expedited development and review. However, the article does not clarify that this does not necessarily mean a breakthrough in the traditional sense.

Overall, the article provides some information about the success of dupilumab in treating severe eczema but lacks specific details, fails to address certain criticisms, and does not disclose the funding sources behind the statistics and expert quotes.
Claim: New Drug for Severe Eczema Is Successful in 2 New Trials
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story about the results of research for what would be the first biologic treatment of moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis) in adults provides plenty of good news to patients. However, while the story accurately summarizes some of the important study results, it fails to alert readers to vital details about the trial design and funding. Not only is there no mention that the makers of the drug paid for the trials and hired writers to produce the article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, the lone independent expert quoted actually receives consulting and speaking fees from one of the drug makers. Also, the story mentions three patients, but not one who had less than spectacular results. Including one of the many patients who did not see their eczema and itching completely disappear would have provided a more balanced view of the trial results. When a drug study is paid for and written by companies that are seeking FDA approval for a treatment, stories should pay special attention to conflicts of interest, study design, and the way the results are presented, in order to help readers sort out hard facts from sponsor spin.

664,"### Context: A group of scientists has successfully grown vaginas in a lab using cells from four teenage girls. The girls, who were born with a rare genetic condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, had underdeveloped or absent vaginas and uteruses. The conventional treatment for this condition involves using grafts made from intestinal tissue or skin, but both have drawbacks. Intestinal tissue produces excess mucus, causing odor problems, while conventional skin can collapse. The researchers collected a small amount of cells from the girls' genital tissue and grew two types of cells in the lab: muscle cells and epithelial cells. After four weeks, they applied layers of these cells onto a collagen scaffold and shaped it to fit each patient's anatomy. The vaginal implants were then surgically attached to the existing reproductive organs. Over time, nerves and blood vessels formed to feed the new organ, and new cells replaced the collagen scaffold. Follow-up tests showed that the engineered vaginas were indistinguishable from the women's own tissue and had grown in size as the women matured. All four women are now sexually active and report normal vaginal function. Two of them, who were born with a working uterus but no vagina, now menstruate normally. It is not yet clear if these women can bear children, but their ability to menstruate suggests that their ovaries are working. This study is the first to show that vaginal organs custom-built in the lab using patients' own cells can be successfully used in humans, offering a new option for women who need reconstructive surgeries. The findings address important questions about tissue engineering, including whether tissue will grow as patients grow and whether an organ as large as the vagina can develop blood vessels when implanted in the body.

665,"### Context: Italy is experiencing a surge in coronavirus deaths, with the number rising by 25% in a day to 1,266. The total number of cases also increased to 17,660. The government has imposed drastic measures, including shutting down bars, restaurants, and most shops, as well as banning non-essential travel. However, these measures have not shown any signs of slowing the spread of the virus. Lombardy, the region surrounding Milan and accounting for three-quarters of all the country's fatalities, is calling for further restrictions, including the closure of factories, offices, and public transport. The government is concerned about the long-term impact on the economy and has not indicated whether it will agree to additional curbs in Italy's business heartlands. Some companies, such as Fiat Chrysler and Brembo, have already decided to temporarily shut down their operations. Italy's fatality rate, at 7% of all those who test positive, is higher than most other countries, which health authorities attribute to an elderly population with underlying health problems. However, other factors, such as separate infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals and difficulties in treating patients needing intensive care, may also contribute to the high fatality rate. Italy has been disappointed by the response of its European allies, as they refused requests for help and limited cross-border traffic, causing confusion and delays. The country has received medical supplies from China and expressed gratitude for the support. In Rome, Pope Francis disagreed with the decision to close all 750 churches in the city and stated that drastic measures are not always good. The Church later revised the order and allowed parish churches and those run by religious communities to remain open.

Fritz waded into waist-high, freezing water to reach the cage and pulled the dog out. He noticed that the dog had other medical issues, including missing fur and skin on her paws. Fritz took the puppy to his truck, turned up the heat, and headed to the University of Illinois Veterinary Hospital. The puppy was treated for hypothermia, and her wounds were cleaned and treated with antibiotics and pain medicine. The dog is responding favorably to treatment. After Champaign County Animal Control takes custody of the puppy, Fritz hopes to adopt her and give her a loving home.

667,"### Context: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK has granted a license to Kathy Niakan, a stem cell scientist from London’s Francis Crick Institute, to carry out experiments using gene editing techniques on human embryos. The research will focus on the first seven days of a fertilized egg's development and will use CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The modified embryos will not be developed for clinical purposes or implanted into women. Niakan's goal is to deepen scientific understanding of how a healthy human embryo develops, which could potentially improve infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). The embryos used in the research will be surplus to donor patients' IVF treatment. The first gene Niakan plans to target is Oct4, which she believes plays a crucial role in early human fetal development. The HFEA's decision has been met with both support and criticism. David King, director of the UK campaign group Human Genetics Alert, believes the research will lead to a future of ""consumer eugenics,"" while Sarah Norcross, director of Progress Educational Trust, sees it as a victory for level-headed regulation. Bruce Whitelaw, a professor of animal biotechnology at Edinburgh University's Roslin Institute, believes the research will contribute to the basic scientific knowledge needed to assist infertile couples and reduce the anguish of miscarriage.

670,"### Context: The article debunks the claim that the reaction between metallic mercury and aluminum, which produces a dramatic chain reaction, is evidence that vaccines are not safe. The claim was made by a Facebook page promoting the anti-vaccine movie ""Vaxxed"" and was accompanied by a video of the reaction. However, the video has since been removed.

The article explains that the reaction shown in the video is irrelevant to vaccine safety in several significant ways. Firstly, the video featured a reaction between metallic mercury and metallic aluminum, while the hypothetical reactants in vaccines would be thimerosal (a mercury-containing organic compound) and aluminum phosphate (a mineral). These two chemicals are different from the elemental metals used in the video and would behave differently.

The article also points out that of all the vaccines approved for use in the United States, only one contains both thimerosal and an aluminum compound. However, this vaccine is not mandated, making it irrelevant to the claim. Furthermore, the reaction between thimerosal and aluminum phosphate is fundamentally different from the one shown in the video.

The article highlights that the video neglected to show the challenges of initiating the reaction and the fact that a third chemical was used to initiate it. The reaction required freshly exposed aluminum metal, which was achieved by reacting the aluminum surface with hydrochloric acid. These conditions and chemicals are not found in vaccines or within the human body.

The article concludes by explaining the process behind the reaction shown in the video. It involves the combination of mercury and aluminum to form an amalgam, which reacts with oxygen to form aluminum oxide. However, this process is short-lived and does not resemble the conditions in vaccines.

In summary, the article debunks the claim that the reaction between metallic mercury and aluminum is evidence that vaccines are not safe. It explains the differences between the reaction shown in the video and the hypothetical reactants in vaccines, as well as the conditions required for the reaction to occur.
Claim: The reaction between metallic mercury and aluminum, which produces a dramatic chain reaction popular on YouTube science channels, is evidence that vaccines are not safe.

671,"### Context: The claim that the deaths of John Beilman and his daughter were linked to the Las Vegas mass shooting is false. John Beilman killed his daughter and himself in a murder-suicide in Fairport, New York, unrelated to the Las Vegas shooting. The motive behind the shooting is unknown. The conspiracy theory linking Beilman's actions to the Las Vegas massacre is based on inaccurate claims and unsupported evidence. The theory originated from the WhatDoesItMean fake news site and was spread by other unreliable websites. The claim that a device found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room was connected to Beilman is false. The charger found in Paddock's room was matched to one of his phones, and the battery mentioned in the conspiracy theory cannot be charged with that charger. Beilman's work history at Ultralife Corporation, a battery manufacturer, was used to falsely suggest a connection to the military or intelligence agencies. The entire conspiracy theory lacks valid evidence and is refuted by the available information. The WhatDoesItMean fabrication gained traction online, leading the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle to debunk it. The spread of this false information on social media by uninformed individuals undermines the credibility of news and poses a danger. The motive behind the murder-suicide is likely unrelated to the FBI search of Beilman's home, as the details of the search warrant affidavit are sealed. The Las Vegas mass shooting has generated numerous conspiracy theories, including the involvement of a second shooter, which have been debunked by law enforcement officials.
Claim: The deaths of John Beilman and his daughter were linked to the Las Vegas mass shooting via a device found in Stephen Paddock's hotel room.

672,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that an increase in cases of people ""scromiting"" (screaming while vomiting) is linked to chronic heavy marijuana use. The term ""scromiting"" was reportedly invented by staff at emergency rooms in the US who are seeing more patients experiencing extreme bouts of screaming and vomiting. This condition is known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS), which affects long-term cannabis consumers. CHS progresses through three phases: prodromal (early symptoms), hyperemetic (severe vomiting), and recovery. Patients in the hyperemetic phase experience incapacitating nausea, profuse vomiting, mild abdominal pain, and weight loss. Taking hot showers is the most effective short-term treatment during this phase.

The cause of CHS and why some heavy marijuana users develop it while others do not is still unknown. The reason why hot showers alleviate the excessive vomiting phase is also unclear. The article mentions that the legalization of marijuana may have played a role in the increased diagnosis of CHS, but more research is needed to understand the relationship between marijuana use and the disease.

Regarding the term ""scromiting,"" the article states that there is no widespread and specific use of this term in relation to any cannabis-related ailment. The term has been included in the internet-slang database Urban Dictionary since at least 2008, suggesting that it predates the emergence of CHS cases in emergency rooms.

In conclusion, the claim that an increase in cases of people ""scromiting"" is linked to chronic heavy marijuana use is mostly true. The condition, known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, does exist and is characterized by severe vomiting and other symptoms. However, the term ""scromiting"" itself may not be widely used in medical contexts. The article also highlights that CHS is rare and can be resolved by ceasing cannabis consumption.

673,"### Context: Rep. Raul Grijalva, along with Rep. Betty McCollum and Rep. Alan Lowenthal, sent a letter to Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt objecting to the Department of Interior's decision to allow employees to work on offshore lease sales, seismic permits, and a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan during the government shutdown. Grijalva criticized the administration for ensuring that the pain of the shutdown falls on ordinary Americans and the environment, rather than the oil and gas industry. He called on Bernhardt to reverse the decision and provide a briefing on the legal justification for potentially violating the Antideficiency Act. The Interior Department responded by saying they are meeting their legal obligations and are willing to meet with the Natural Resources Committee. Grijalva accused President Trump of causing the shutdown over the border wall, resulting in 800,000 federal workers missing paychecks, Native Americans at risk of losing access to food and healthcare, and extended delays in airports and national parks. He criticized the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) for updating its contingency plan to allow employees to work on oil and gas development, stating that the administration only cares about its favorite industry. Grijalva also accused the department of continuing to hold public meetings on oil and gas development in Alaska, refusing to extend the comment period for leasing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and allowing drilling permits to be issued. BOEM responded by stating that they are using carry-over money from the 2018 fiscal year for these activities. Lowenthal added that federal workers are being brought in without pay to service the oil and gas industry, while those dealing with renewable energy remain furloughed. He criticized the BOEM for prioritizing oil and gas companies over other industries.

674,"### Context: A new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that only one out of six adults and one in four binge drinkers in the United States have discussed their drinking habits with their doctors. The study, based on 166,000 interviews in 44 states and the District of Columbia in 2011, revealed that the percentage of patients who had ever discussed their drinking with a healthcare provider ranged from 8.7 percent in Kansas to 25.5 percent in Washington, D.C. CDC Director Thomas Frieden believes that this needs to change and that discussing alcohol consumption should be a routine part of patient care, similar to screening for high blood pressure or high cholesterol. 

The CDC defines binge drinking as consuming five or more drinks in a few hours for men and four or more for women. The agency recommends that adult men should not exceed two drinks per day on average, while women should not exceed one drink per day. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to various health problems, including heart disease, liver damage, and breast cancer. 

The study also found that doctors often do not screen patients for alcohol abuse due to time constraints and a perception that treatment options are ineffective. However, Frieden argues that asking patients about their alcohol use and providing advice on how to reduce it, or referring severe cases for specialized treatment, can be effective in many cases. He suggests that counseling for a few minutes can result in a significant reduction in problem drinking. 

Frieden also highlights that the federal Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires new insurance plans to cover alcohol screening without any patient co-pay. This provision aims to encourage doctors to discuss alcohol consumption with their patients. 

In conclusion, the study reveals that a large number of doctors in the United States fail to discuss alcohol consumption with their patients. The CDC emphasizes the importance of addressing this issue, as excessive alcohol use contributes to a significant number of deaths each year. The agency recommends that discussing alcohol consumption should be a routine part of patient care, and that even brief counseling sessions can lead to a reduction in problem drinking.

675,"### Context: Health officials have disclosed another outbreak of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce, which has now ended. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that 23 people were sickened between July 12 and September 8, but no deaths were reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suspected leafy greens as the source of the E. coli illnesses by September 19, and on October 2, romaine lettuce was identified as the likely culprit. However, the FDA stated that the tainted produce was no longer on shelves by the time romaine was identified as the source, so immediate public communication was not deemed necessary.

This recent outbreak follows a series of previous outbreaks, including one in 2018 that sickened over 200 people and resulted in five deaths. The cause of these outbreaks remains unclear, but experts highlight the challenge of eliminating the risk posed by raw vegetables grown in open fields. The previous outbreak in 2018 was traced back to Yuma, Arizona, one of the main regions that grow romaine lettuce, with a cattle feedlot identified as a potential contamination source. Another outbreak just before Thanksgiving was traced to central California, the other key region for romaine production. Following these outbreaks, produce groups in both states have implemented stricter safety measures.

The FDA is collaborating with scientists to investigate how romaine lettuce may become contaminated. Meanwhile, the CDC is investigating a separate multistate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to ground beef. Eight out of ten infected individuals were hospitalized, including one death. The CDC has not identified a single, common supplier and is reminding people to thoroughly cook ground beef.

In conclusion, health officials have disclosed another outbreak of E. coli linked to romaine lettuce, which has now ended. The cause of these outbreaks remains unknown, but efforts are being made to study how romaine lettuce may become contaminated. Additionally, the CDC is investigating a separate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to ground beef.

676,"### Context: The article discusses Congressman John Boehner's claim that the United States government's debt will soon exceed the size of the national economy. The article verifies this claim by looking at the debt and GDP numbers from the Treasury Department and the U.S. Commerce Department. It states that on the day Boehner became speaker of the House, the total debt was $14 trillion, while the GDP was $14.745 trillion. However, the article also acknowledges that economists argue that not all government debt is equally troubling, and that only the public debt, which includes money owed to the public and must be repaid in real cash, should be used when measuring its size against the total economy. The public debt on the day Boehner took control of the House was nearly $9.4 trillion, which was nearly 62 percent of the GDP. The article mentions that the Congressional Budget Office projects that if current practices aren't changed, the public debt could reach 90 percent of GDP by 2020 and 185 percent of GDP by 2035. The article also discusses the potential consequences of a high debt-to-GDP ratio, such as higher interest rates, tax hikes, spending cuts, and stingier government entitlements. It notes that while there are more optimistic projections in current budget documents, the dire projections are based on realistic expectations about the way Washington operates, such as the continuation of temporary policies and the renewal of tax cuts. The article concludes that while some economists believe that with sensible policy changes and a robust economy, the debt problem may not be as severe, the agreement between the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and President Barack Obama's fiscal commission on the scope of the problem supports Boehner's claim.

677,"### Context: State Senator Dick Black, a staunch opponent of abortion, has accused his Democratic opponent, Jill McCabe, of supporting the sale of fetal tissue for profit. Black claims that McCabe ""supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."" The controversy over fetal tissue sales began when the Center for Medical Progress released an undercover video showing a Planned Parenthood official discussing the sale of fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood has denied making a profit from the sale of fetal tissue and maintains that the tissue is donated for scientific research. Federal law prohibits the sale of fetal tissue for profit, but allows clinics to receive reimbursement for their collection costs. In the video, the Planned Parenthood official discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided. However, experts have stated that these fees do not appear to be geared towards making a profit. Instead, many of the sales are made to brokers who process the tissue and sell it to researchers at significant markups. Black's claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit is not based on any explicit statement from McCabe, but rather on her endorsements from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. McCabe has stated that she supports Planned Parenthood because they provide healthcare choices for women. When asked about late term abortions and selling tissue for profit, McCabe's campaign manager stated that she does not support late term abortions unless it is in the best health interest of the mother or child, and she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit. Black's accusation is based on speculation and he offers no evidence to support his claim.

### Explanation:
",false,"Sen. Dick Black says McCabe, ""supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."" McCabe indicates she supports late term abortions in instances when it is ""in the best health interest"" of the mother or child. She says she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit.

678,"### Context: State Sen. Dave Marsden claims that expanding Medicaid in Virginia will save lives, using Massachusetts' experience as proof. He refers to a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, which found that the death rate in Massachusetts dropped by 3.2 percent among 20-64 year-olds after the state enacted health care reform in 2006. This decline was 2.9 percent greater than the average of a comparison group of 531 counties across the nation. The study also found that the largest death rate drops occurred in Massachusetts counties with low insurance coverage prior to the reforms. However, the researchers caution that they could not definitively establish a ""cause and effect"" relationship between the lowered death rate and the health reforms. They also note that the results in Massachusetts may not apply to other states. 

While some health economists view the study as strong evidence that the Massachusetts health care overhaul saved lives, others argue that it does not settle the long-debated question of whether being insured prolongs life. Other studies have shown mixed results regarding the effect of health insurance on mortality. A 2012 report in the New England Journal of Medicine found significant decreases in mortality in several states that expanded their Medicaid eligibility programs before the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. However, the researchers could not definitively establish causality. In contrast, a 2011 study of Medicaid expansion in Oregon did not find a link between health insurance and death rates. A 2013 follow-up study found improvements in mental health and lower financial strain among beneficiaries, but no improvement in important physical attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.

In conclusion, Marsden's claim that the mortality rate in Massachusetts dropped by at least 2.9 percent after the state enacted health care reform is accurate. However, the statement that the reforms ""saved lives"" needs clarification, as the researchers could not establish a direct causal relationship between the lowered death rate and the health reforms.
Claim: After Massachusetts passed a mandatory health insurance law ""their mortality rate went down...it saved lives.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Marsden said that after Massachusetts enacted its sweeping health care reform in 2006, its mortality rate dropped by at least 2.9 percent, ""saving lives."" His statement correctly summarizes a recent study finding the state’s death rate dropped by 3.2 percent among 20-64 year-olds. The decline was 2.9 percent greater than the average of a comparison group of 531 counties across the nation. But Marsden reaches a little when he says the results proved the health reforms ""saved lives."" Researchers believe that’s the case, but caution they could not establish a ""cause and effect"" between the lowered death rate and the health reforms. So Marsden’s statement is accurate, but needs a little clarification.","After Massachusetts passed a mandatory health insurance law ""their mortality rate went down...it saved lives.","Marsden said, """"After Massachusetts passed a mandatory health insurance law 'their mortality rate went down...it saved lives.' """" Marsden is right that the mortality rate among 20- to 64-year-olds in Massachusetts dropped by at least 2.9 percent after the state enacted health care reform in 2006.

679,"### Context: The article discusses a Twitter thread posted by British anesthesiologist Jason Van Schoor, in which he shares claims attributed to a well-respected friend and intensivist/A&E consultant currently in northern Italy. One of the major claims in the thread is that Lombardy, the most developed region in Italy, is overwhelmed by Covid-19 and running at 200% capacity in hospitals. This claim is supported by the fact that more than 80% of the region's acute-care beds are dedicated to coronavirus patients, and additional places have been opened to cope with the emergency. However, Lombardy's top health official, Giulio Gallera, states that as of now, the region's healthcare system is holding up well, but if the number of infected people in need of intensive care continues to increase, issues could arise.

It is important to note that Van Schoor's account is not a translation of another widely disseminated post by Daniele Macchini, a doctor at the Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital in Bergamo. Macchini's post, which has been read and shared by thousands, does not contain a list claiming to be the pattern for COVID-19 cases. Van Schoor's thread includes a passage about how to treat COVID-19 patients, emphasizing the importance of strict measures to keep people safe and not being afraid to take such measures. However, it is unclear how much of the information in Van Schoor's thread is legitimate.

The article concludes by mentioning that there is an anesthesiologist named Jason Van Schoor practicing in England, and the Twitter account appears to be genuine. However, further details are needed to verify the legitimacy of the information shared in the thread. The author reached out to Van Schoor for more information but has not received a response yet.

680,"### Context: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a statement regarding the gel called Regranex, which is used to treat diabetic leg and foot wounds. The FDA stated that a study of the gel found an increase in the number of cancer deaths among patients who had been prescribed the gel three or more times. The gel, approved for use in the US in 1997, is now being investigated for potential risks.

The FDA believes that there may be evidence for an increased risk of death from cancer in patients who had repeated treatments with Regranex. However, they also acknowledge that there are known risks associated with diabetic foot and leg ulcers that do not heal, and therefore the potential risk of using Regranex should be weighed against the benefit for each individual patient.

Barbara Montresor, a spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Inc unit, which manufactures the gel, stated that the company is working with the FDA and believes that Regranex is safe when used as directed.

The concern about the gel arose following a study of adult diabetes patients through an insurance plan database. The study found an increase in cancer deaths from January 1998 through June 2003, but did not identify a specific type of cancer. The FDA did not disclose who conducted the study or how many patients were included.

The FDA also mentioned an earlier study completed in 2001, which found that more cancers were found in Regranex patients compared to those who did not use the gel. However, further details about these studies were not provided.

In response to this news, shares of Johnson & Johnson closed down slightly on the New York Stock Exchange.

Overall, the FDA has raised concerns about the potential increased risk of cancer deaths among patients who have been prescribed Regranex multiple times. They advise that the potential risk should be weighed against the benefit for each individual patient. Johnson & Johnson maintains that the gel is safe when used as directed.

Several cases of rabies in skunks have been confirmed in Southfield. Other cases also have been confirmed in Rochester Hills and Troy. Health officials say bats and skunks are the most common carriers of rabies in Michigan. Symptoms in animals include general sickness, swallowing problems and excessive drooling, slow and unusual movement, no apparent fear of humans and aggression.

682,"### Context: The article discusses a bill in the Florida Legislature that requires physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts. The bill is not facing the usual partisan fight, but some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, used a specific figure in a committee hearing to support the bill, stating that 1,270 infants died following attempted abortions in 2010. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which collect abortion data, do not have data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. The article questions where Yoest obtained this figure from. The bill includes a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. Supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary to ensure that infants born alive receive appropriate medical treatment. Physicians who fail to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion could face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. The article also mentions that 28 states have laws protecting infants born alive, and the proposed Florida law mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. The article notes that the CDC has a category called ""other perinatal conditions,"" which includes deaths of infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth. In 2010, there were 1,270 deaths in this category, but it is unclear how many of these deaths were due to abortions. The article concludes that Yoest's claim about 1,270 infants dying after abortion procedures is not supported by the available data. The figure is based on an ""other"" category of perinatal deaths, which includes babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems.
Claim: In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year.

683,"### Context: President Trump has expressed support for a plan in Florida that would allow the importation of lower-cost prescription drugs from other countries. The move is seen as a confrontation between the Trump administration and the pharmaceutical industry, which has long fought against importation proposals. Trump made the announcement at a White House event where he pledged to end surprise medical bills for patients with health insurance coverage. He stated that states may be allowed to buy drugs from other countries if they can be purchased at a significantly lower price. The plan in Florida, which is expected to be signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, would require approval from the Department of Health and Human Services before implementation. The program would give Floridians access to cheaper Canadian prescription drugs, with supporters arguing that imported drugs would meet FDA standards and that a large percentage of drug ingredients used in the US are already foreign-made. The bill faced opposition from major pharmaceutical companies and medical organizations, who claimed that importing drugs would pose risks of counterfeit or ineffective substances and would be difficult to regulate. Some experts have expressed concerns about whether Canadian drugmakers have the capacity to supply the larger US market. However, consumer groups have strongly supported the idea, believing that it will pressure drugmakers to reduce prices. AARP, a leading advocacy group for older Americans, praised Trump for supporting the Florida legislation, stating that it would help reduce prescription drug costs. On the other hand, the pharmaceutical industry lobby, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, argued that the plan would put Floridians at risk and potentially allow counterfeit or adulterated medications. They claimed that there is no evidence that the plan would save patients money or guarantee their safety.

684,"### Context: The claim that a video shows a bolt of lightning striking a river and causing a large explosion is false. The video actually shows the work of a Finnish water engineering company called Rannikon Merityö. The video, titled ""Porapaalutusta, osa 3: Räjäytys"" (Drilling rig, part 3: Blasting), was uploaded to YouTube by the company in 2012. It was included on the company's website on a page about underwater mining and blasting.

The video shows an explosion caused by a detonation cord used by the company to dislodge a stump or a tree from the river. The ""lightning bolt"" seen in the video is actually the result of the explosion, not a natural lightning strike. Meteorologist Dan Skoff initially lent credence to the claim that it was lightning by reposting the video on Facebook, but later updated his post to clarify that it was not lightning but a detonation cord.

The video is not a viral video showing a natural phenomenon, but rather a demonstration of the work done by Rannikon Merityö in underwater mining and blasting. The company uses underwater quarrying to lower the rock surface level in lakes, oceans, and other bodies of water. They insert underwater special explosives into drilling holes to extract rock.

The video does not provide evidence of lightning striking a river. Instead, it shows the work of a dredging company using explosives underwater. The claim that the video shows a bolt of lightning striking a river is false.

685,"### Context: Leaders of companies in Pennsylvania are struggling to fill job vacancies in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation due to a lack of qualified workers. The problem is exacerbated by the retirement of baby boomers and the opioid crisis, which has affected the pool of available workers. State officials predict that the demand for jobs such as truck drivers and nurses will see double-digit surges by 2024. The need for electricians is expected to increase by more than 12 percent. The problem is particularly acute in areas such as New Castle, Johnstown, and Sharon, where unemployment rates are still relatively high. The lack of workers in the trades can be attributed to a decades-long education message that stigmatized vocational training and pushed students towards four-year college degrees. As a result, there is now a shortage of skilled workers in fields such as welding, mechanics, machine operation, and painting. The nursing field is also experiencing shortages, not due to a lack of workers, but because of a surge in demand and the availability of more career options for women. The state of Pennsylvania provides data on high-priority jobs to help regional workforce boards determine where to invest their resources. The state also projects future job demands and sorts the information based on the level of training or education required. The Wolf Administration has requested $50 million in the 2018-19 budget to fund workforce development initiatives. Some of the fastest-growing jobs in the next few years will be in healthcare, but there will also be strong demand for truck drivers and industrial jobs. The Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Conference on Community Development has projected a workforce shortfall of over 80,000 through 2027 in a 10-county region. The economic development group emphasizes the need for practical solutions to address the shortage of skilled workers.

687,"### Context: Billy Caldwell, a 12-year-old boy with epilepsy, had his cannabis oil confiscated by customs officials when he returned to London from Canada with his mother. Billy's doctor had been ordered to stop prescribing the oil, leading to his hospitalization after suffering seizures. The case has sparked a debate on the therapeutic use of cannabis, with politicians and campaigners calling for changes to the law. In response to the situation, the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, issued a license to allow Billy to be treated with cannabis oil, citing advice from senior clinicians who deemed it a medical emergency.

Billy's mother, Charlotte Caldwell, who claims that her son was seizure-free while using the cannabis oil, called for a change in the law, stating that no other family should have to go through the ordeal they experienced. She urged the government to adopt a more humane policy and not resort to panic measures. The Home Office had previously stated that it had a duty to prevent banned substances from entering the country, despite sympathizing with Billy's situation. Cannabis is classified as a schedule 1 drug in the UK, meaning it is not recognized as having therapeutic value. However, it can be used for research and clinical trials under a Home Office license.

The Caldwell family, who reside in Northern Ireland, received support from various members of parliament, including Dan Poulter from the ruling Conservative Party. Billy had been receiving medicinal cannabis oil on prescription from his family doctor for over a year, but the supplies were cut off after the Home Office's order to stop prescribing it.

In response to the public outcry and the urgent need for Billy's treatment, the UK authorities released the confiscated cannabis oil. This incident has brought attention to the issue of medical cannabis and the need for a more compassionate approach to its use. The case of Billy Caldwell highlights the challenges faced by families seeking access to cannabis-based treatments for serious medical conditions and has sparked a call for a change in the law.

A Facebook user claimed that a client's foils became hot and emitted smoke after using Pantene products, but this claim has not been verified by other salon professionals or Pantene themselves. Pantene stated that their products are safe to use with salon services and have been thoroughly tested for any adverse reactions. The ingredient lists of Pantene products do not contain any unusual or atypical substances. Both Pantene and salon-favorite Bumble and Bumble shampoos contain the silicon-based polymer Dimethicone. The claim that Pantene contains ""plastics"" is also debunked, as the substance referred to, PEG-7M, is actually a common emulsifier found in salon products, not Pantene. The idea that Pantene coats the hair with plastic or wax is a myth started by stylists to discourage clients from using drugstore products. Pantene's shampoo and conditioner formulas are believed to be among the best in the industry and have been shown to outperform salon products in blind consumer testing. The claim that Pantene causes hair to fall out is also false. Overall, there is no evidence to support the claim that Pantene products cause a build-up on hair that leads to it heating up and smoking when combined with highlight foils.

689,"### Context: The article discusses a question posed to state Rep. Jeff Brandes during a luncheon meeting by a member of the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club. The questioner asked if Brandes was a fraud because he had promised to take the Legislature to the woodshed during his campaign but had not followed through. Brandes responded by clarifying that his campaign promise was specifically aimed at those who wanted to increase taxes or government regulation. He defended his record by stating that he had stood up against the speaker and the governor on various issues, including voting against drug testing welfare recipients.

The article then examines Brandes' voting record during the 2011 legislative session. It highlights instances where Brandes went against the Republican leadership and the majority of the Florida House of Representatives. For example, he was the only person in the Legislature to vote against a bill that added licensing requirements for pest control businesses. He also voted against a bill that allowed a mobile home park homeowners association to buy its park outright if the owner wanted to change its land use. Brandes opposed the majority of Republicans on issues such as severance pay restrictions, false claims of military service, capping damages in wrongful death cases, and lengthening a sales tax holiday.

However, the article also notes that Brandes supported his party on several key priorities, including bills related to public employee unions, abortion restrictions, growth management laws, election law changes, and a constitutional amendment for two Supreme Courts. The article concludes that while Brandes did not always go against his party, he did stand alone on some votes and sometimes aligned with Democrats.

In response to Brandes' statement that he had been the only ""no"" vote on the entire board on multiple occasions, the article confirms that he was indeed the sole dissenting vote in the Legislature on two occasions. It acknowledges that Brandes did go against his party and sided with Democrats on certain issues. However, it does not definitively determine whether his actions align with his campaign promise of taking Tallahassee to the woodshed.

690,"### Context: Assemblywoman Patricia Fahy and Sen. Liz Krueger have introduced a bill in New York that would allow anyone 14 years or older to receive immunizations even if their parents object. The lawmakers argue that many parents are influenced by unsupported online claims that vaccines are unsafe. The bill is supported by the three New York chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who believe that young people are often better at discerning false information on the internet. They argue that adolescents and young adults should have the right to protect themselves from preventable diseases through immunizations. The legislation comes in response to reported measles outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County, where vaccination rates are typically lower. The lawmakers and pediatricians stress that not getting vaccinated not only puts the individual at risk but also endangers others. The bill was introduced just days after an Ohio teen testified before Congress about defying his mother's anti-vaccine beliefs, which were fueled by online conspiracy theories. The teen emphasized the need to combat fraudulent claims about vaccine safety. Multiple studies have debunked the claim that vaccines increase the risk of autism. Some states, including Oregon and South Carolina, already allow minors to seek vaccinations without parental approval, but they may require an evaluation to determine if the minor is mature enough to make that decision. The New York bill does not require such evaluations.

691,"### Context: The article discusses the discovery of an invasive species of fish called the snakehead fish in Georgia. The fish has the unique ability to survive on land and breathe air. Officials are urging anyone who comes into contact with the species to kill it immediately to prevent its spread to other waters in Georgia. The northern snakehead fish has a lung-like labyrinth organ near its gills that allows it to store atmospheric oxygen and draw from it as it swims, enabling it to survive in low oxygen water. The fish can also use its bimodal breathing ability to move between bodies of water. The snakehead fish's ability to breathe air is not unique, as there are other fish species with similar adaptations. The mangrove rivulus, for example, has specialized skin that takes on the role of gills and allows it to breathe air. The walking catfish, another species, has an extra organ that supports its gills and helps it take in oxygen from the air. The snakehead fish's ability to survive on land has caused panic in the past, with media portraying it as a ""monster fish"" capable of hunting on land. However, the fish is not an adept ground hunter and cannot traverse long distances over land. While young snakeheads can travel overland for a short distance, adult snakeheads are too large to move effectively on land. They primarily feed on other fish, crawfish, and frogs. Adult snakeheads have been documented to live out of water for up to four days. The article concludes by stating that the snakehead fish's ability to survive on land is not a threat to humans or pets.

692,"### Context: The article discusses a series of posters created by James Kennedy, a high school chemistry teacher, that depict the chemical composition of various fruits. These posters, which have been circulating on the internet since 2013, aim to show that even natural foods can sound unnatural and potentially unhealthy when described scientifically. The claim that the chemical composition of a banana can be accurately represented by a list of chemicals is supported by Kennedy's work.

Kennedy's posters break down the major ingredients in popular natural foods using E-numbers and IUPAC names instead of common names. For example, anthocyanins, which give blueberries their ""superfood"" status, are also known as E163. Kennedy uses a variety of different nomenclatural methods to highlight the complexity and unpredictability of nature's compounds, mechanisms, and structures.

In the case of a banana, the most common grouping of chemicals is sugars, with glucose and fructose being the predominant ones, along with lesser amounts of sucrose and maltose. The next listed set of chemicals is fiber, represented by a group of chemicals listed by their E-numbers, which are codes assigned to substances permitted as food additives in the European Union. These fiber chemicals are either cellulose or breakdown products of cellulose.

Amino acids, fatty acids, and minerals (ash) are also listed as chemicals found in bananas. Kennedy uses different chemical-naming conventions to obscure the fact that these chemicals are commonly known by other names. The coloring agents in bananas are natural and may be recognized by different names.

The remaining chemicals listed, such as E1510 (ethanol) and ethylene gas, are also natural. Ethanol forms naturally as fruit ferments, and ethylene gas is a plant hormone associated with aging that triggers the ripening process. In the food industry, ethylene gas is used on a large scale to ripen various fruits and vegetables simultaneously.

Overall, the article supports the claim that a list of chemicals, presented as if they were ingredients on a food label, accurately represents the chemical composition of a banana. Kennedy's posters aim to educate and erode the fear of ""chemicals"" by demonstrating the complexity and natural origins of these compounds found in everyday foods.

693,"### Context: In February and March 2018, hundreds of Canadian doctors in Quebec signed a petition opposing pay increases negotiated between doctors' unions and the provincial government. The doctors, who are part of a group called MQRP (Quebecois Doctors for the Public Plan), believe that the money should be reallocated to help nurses and patients in need. The petition had garnered 944 signatures from doctors and medical students as of March 21, 2018. However, it is unclear if all the signatures belong to registered medical professionals.

The pay deals in question include a salary increase for medical specialists from $4.7 billion to $5.4 billion by 2023, an increase of 1.4% each year. Specialists in Quebec currently earn an average of $403,537 per year, compared to $367,154 in Ontario. General practitioners in Quebec also signed an eight-year deal in October 2017, which includes an average pay increase of 1.8% per year.

While the petition received significant attention, it is important to note that the doctors opposing the pay increases represent only a small fraction of all doctors in Quebec. As of January 1, 2018, there were nearly 21,000 active, registered doctors in the province. Therefore, the 944 signatures on the petition make up only 4.5% of the total number of doctors.

The doctors who signed the petition argue that the pay increases are shocking considering the difficult working conditions faced by nurses, clerks, and other healthcare employees, as well as the lack of access to necessary services for patients. They believe that the resources of the healthcare system should be better distributed to benefit all healthcare workers and ensure a healthcare system that the people of Quebec deserve.

Overall, the article highlights the opposition of a group of Quebecois doctors to pay increases negotiated between doctors' unions and the provincial government. While the petition received attention, it is important to note that the doctors opposing the pay increases represent only a small percentage of all doctors in Quebec.

694,"### Context: A recent study suggests that the immune-focused drug Opdivo may be more effective than the current standard of care for patients who have had surgery to remove advanced melanoma. The study, funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the company that markets Opdivo, compared the use of Opdivo to the use of Yervoy, another drug approved by the FDA to treat advanced melanoma. The study found that after a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared to 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. At 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy. The study was conducted across 130 medical centers in 25 countries and included a large number of patients.

The article highlights the importance of addressing the cost of treatment with Opdivo, as it can reach well into the tens of thousands of dollars or more. It also notes that the term ""recurrence-free survival"" does not indicate how many patients are actually living longer because of the treatment, but rather how much time elapses before recurrence. The most common side effects of Opdivo were fatigue and diarrhea, but the article emphasizes that Opdivo was less likely to cause adverse side effects than Yervoy, and that those side effects were less severe.

The article provides valuable context by mentioning that the study was a randomized, double-blind, phase-3 trial, which strengthens the credibility of the findings. It also mentions that Opdivo is already approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma, either alone or in combination with Yervoy. The article incorporates input from two independent sources, one of which states that Opdivo is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease.

Overall, the article goes beyond the news release associated with the research and provides important information about the effectiveness and side effects of Opdivo compared to Yervoy. However, it does not address the cost of treatment, which is a significant oversight.
Claim: Immune-Focused Drug May Be New Weapon Against Advanced Melanoma
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The story focuses on a recent study that found the drug nivolumab (sold under the trade name Opdivo) is superior to the drug ipilimumab (sold as Yervoy) in preventing recurrence of Stage 3 and Stage 4 melanoma after surgery, at least when it comes to recurrence-free survival. The story does a good job addressing side effects and highlighting who funded the research. The story would have been stronger if it had mentioned the steep costs of these drugs. Study results related to new drugs are often overhyped, raising hopes in cancer patients without giving patients (and their loved ones) the information they need to place the new research findings in context. This story uses fairly cautious language and addresses the research and its findings in detail.",Immune-Focused Drug May Be New Weapon Against Advanced Melanoma,"This story reports on a study that compared the use of the drug Opdivo (nivolumab) to the drug Yervoy (ipilimumab) in the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. The study found that patients treated with Opdivo had a lower risk of the cancer recurring or spreading to other parts of the body. The story does a good job of describing the study, and of quantifying the benefits of treatment. It also does a good job of describing the side effects of treatment. The story would have been stronger if it had mentioned the cost of treatment, and if it had mentioned that the study was funded by the drug’s manufacturer. Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. It is responsible for more deaths than all other types of skin cancer combined. The development of new drugs that can extend the lives of patients with advanced melanoma is important news."
695,"### Context: Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed claimed that when he took office, the city's reserves were $7.4 million, but now they are in excess of $56 million. The city's main account for managing finances is the general fund, which is used to pay for services such as police, fire, parks, and recreation. The general fund is funded through property taxes, sales taxes, business licenses, and other sources. In the fiscal year that ended in June 2009, the city had a reserve fund of $7.4 million. By the end of the fiscal year that ended in June 2010, the general fund reserve had increased to at least $56 million, according to the mayor. The city achieved this by putting $27 million into the reserve fund and raising property taxes. The previous administration believed that the city needed a rainy day fund of about $100 million to protect against economic downturns. The city also received nearly $5 million in stimulus funds from the federal government. Atlanta officials reported a general fund balance of $68 million by the end of the fiscal year in June. The city was able to add nearly $12.3 million to the reserve through interest payments and controlled spending. City Councilman Howard Shook confirmed that the mayor's math is accurate and attributed the city's improved financial situation to tighter fiscal management and budget cuts made before the new administration took office. However, a certified public accountant noted that more information is needed about the city's reserves, pension liability, and severance pay to determine the accuracy of the surplus estimate. The city's fiscal year 2010 books have not been audited yet, so the ruling on the mayor's claim is reserved until the audit is completed.

696,"### Context: The article addresses a Facebook post that criticizes Democrats for including unnecessary spending in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The post claims that $25 million of relief aid went to the Kennedy Center, $350 million went to refugee resettlement, $75 million went to PBS, and $25 million went to congressional salaries and expenses. The article explains that while some of these claims are accurate, others are misleading.

Regarding the funding for the Kennedy Center, it is stated that the center has lost more than $20 million in unrecoverable costs from canceled performances and has lost the ability to generate revenue from ticket sales. The funding in the bill is intended to prevent the center from becoming insolvent and potentially unable to reopen.

Regarding the $350 million earmarked for ""Department of State migration and refugee assistance,"" the article clarifies that it may be used for humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with internal displacement due to the virus. The Trump administration's State Department has highlighted its role in providing assistance to other countries in response to the pandemic.

The funding for PBS is explained to be for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public broadcasters like PBS. The bill provides ""stabilization support"" for stations experiencing declines in non-federal revenues. The article emphasizes that it is standard practice for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to receive funding from congressional legislation.

Regarding the claim about congressional salaries, the article clarifies that the funding is for the House's capability to telework, reimbursements for the House Child Care Center, food service contracts, and the House sergeant-at-arms. The bill does not provide a pay boost for lawmakers.

The article also addresses the claim that laid-off workers receive nothing from the bill. It explains that individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive a $1,200 tax-free payment from the government. Additionally, the bill includes generous add-on amounts to state unemployment payments, with $260 billion set aside to increase state unemployment payments by $600 a week. The bill also incentivizes states to waive waiting periods for receiving benefits and provides funds for states to extend the time limits for receiving unemployment benefits by 13 weeks. Gig workers, such as freelancers and Uber drivers, will also qualify for enhanced unemployment provisions.

In conclusion, the article acknowledges that some of the claims in the Facebook post are accurate, but it emphasizes that the post misleads by suggesting that laid-off workers receive nothing from the bill. The article highlights the financial assistance provided to individuals and the bipartisan support for the bill.

697,"### Context: The article discusses the story of a family with three boys suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and their hope for an experimental drug to be approved by the FDA. The cost of the drug is mentioned as a potential barrier, as it is expected to be expensive and there is uncertainty about insurance coverage. The mother of the boys provides detailed information about the drug's effectiveness based on her sons' level of activity.

The article briefly mentions clinical trial results that showed ""some slight positive results,"" but does not provide further details. Side effects of the drug, such as increases in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, are mentioned but not quantified or described in detail. The National Center for Health Research's testimony about the risks of combining the drug with other medications commonly taken by the boys is highlighted as important.

The story acknowledges the murkiness of clinical trial results and the recommendation by the National Center for Health Research to vote against approving the drug. However, it does not provide a clear understanding of the evidence on which such a decision would be based. The article suggests that input from an expert in muscular dystrophy without a vested interest in the drug's approval would have strengthened the story.

The article emphasizes that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a fatal condition and mentions that there is no known cure. It briefly mentions another FDA-approved drug, Exondys 51, but clarifies that it is not effective for the type of DMD afflicting the three boys. The family's anticipation of the FDA's decision on the drug creates narrative tension in the story.

The unique aspect of the drug is highlighted, as it aims to override the specific genetic mutations causing this type of DMD. The article concludes by stating that the story is not based on a news release.

The story is filled with emotional freight, pitting anecdotal evidence (the mother’s reflection on her sons’ vigor, which she attributes to the drug) against systematic evidence that that finds little in the way of robust benefits. While such a story offers readers a compelling look at the sometimes anguished process of clinical research in the face of a lethal disease, it gives too short shrift to the clinical research evidence available here. On the other hand, the story did a great job explaining the costs and insurance hurdles around drugs like this, as well as the possible mechanisms behind how this drug and similar ones work. Letting the emotional intensity of anecdotal information duke it out with systematic research findings is a proven reader-grabber. But selecting this narrative route requires dedication to a story line that never lets the reader forget that good, systematic evidence is paramount.

However, the article clarifies that Brazil actually used a slightly different version of the vaccine called Tdap. The article also states that there is no evidence to support the assertion that either version of the vaccine is responsible for microcephaly. Multiple studies have found no ill effects on babies whose mothers received the vaccine, and not a single study has raised concerns about birth defects, including microcephaly. The article also mentions that administering the vaccine later in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of it interfering with fetal development. The claim that the DTaP vaccine is the most likely cause of microcephaly is inaccurate in every respect, including the naming of the wrong version of the vaccine used in Brazil.

699,"### Context: The article discusses a strange story that went viral in June 2018, which involved a man who had his foot amputated and then cooked and ate a portion of it. The story originated from an anonymous post on Reddit, where the man claimed that he had been in a motorcycle accident and decided to have his foot amputated because he would never be able to walk on it again. He asked the doctors to keep his amputated foot and signed the necessary paperwork to retain custody of it.

According to the man, many hospitals have policies that allow patients to keep their amputated body parts, especially for religious reasons. The man's mother helped him retrieve his foot from the hospital, unaware that he intended to eat it. The hospital gave him his foot in a red plastic biowaste bag, and he immediately put it in a cooler.

While the idea of retaining and consuming an amputated limb may seem bizarre, medical professionals have confirmed that it is not unheard of. Some hospitals have procedures in place for patients to request and retain their amputated body parts. However, there are restrictions in certain states and under certain laws that prohibit private ownership or trade of body parts.

The article also mentions that the man's claim of cooking and eating his foot cannot be fact-checked, but it is plausible. He mentioned that a friend's partner prepared the foot and described it as having a beefy flavor but being tough and chewy.

In summary, the article confirms that people who undergo amputations can sign paperwork to take their removed limbs home after the procedure. While the story of a man cooking and eating his amputated foot cannot be verified, medical professionals acknowledge that retaining amputated body parts is not uncommon.

700,"### Context: Chinese scientist He Jiankui, who claimed to have used the CRISPR gene-editing tool to alter the DNA of twin girls, kept much of his work secret and made questionable decisions on secrecy and medical ethics, according to an article by Christina Larson for the Associated Press. He's aspirations to create gene-edited babies began in 2016, and he worked on the experiment for over two years, concealing information from medical staff and his own bosses. He took advantage of loosely worded and irregularly enforced regulations in China, as well as generous funding. The experiment drew swift outrage from researchers and regulators, with mainstream scientists saying it should never have been attempted. China's National Health Commission has ordered an investigation into He's actions, and it is unclear if he could face criminal charges. He's career trajectory did not follow the expected script, as he did not publish most of his earlier research on modifying DNA in mice and monkeys. He was born in 1984 in southern China and moved to the United States for graduate studies, earning a Ph.D. in biophysics from Rice University. He returned to China in 2012 to take up a post at Southern University of Science and Technology, where he was interested in human genome editing. He's research was funded in part by a program to recruit China-born scientists working abroad. He believed gene editing of human embryos resulting in live births was legal in China because there is no specific law forbidding it, although the country has banned human cloning for reproduction. He reached out to an AIDS advocacy group in Beijing to recruit study participants, aiming to rewrite DNA before birth to make children less likely to contract HIV. He did not seek prior approval from federal regulators and did not inform all medical staff involved in the research that it involved gene editing. Patient consent forms referred to the study imprecisely as an ""AIDS vaccine development"" program. He also sought consultation from an ethics committee outside the hospitals involved. He's own university, Southern University of Science and Technology, was not informed about his work and stated that it ""seriously violated academic ethics and standards."" He's research team included his former Rice adviser, physics professor Michael Deem, who is under investigation by Rice for his involvement. He said in an interview that gene-edited babies were inevitable and he wanted to be the first.

In this photograph, however, the black ER staff doesn’t turn the tables by refusing to treat a KKK member despite his membership in an organization dedicated to terrorizing them; instead, they diligently work at saving his life, the same as they would for any other patient:  Despite many viewers’ mistaking it for such, this photo was not a real historical image, nor was it a screen capture taken from an episode of the then-popular television hospital drama ER, (and the doctor shown in the center of the picture was not actor Eriq LaSalle, who portrayed surgeon Dr. Peter Benton in that TV series). The crease down the middle of the image gave it away as a picture scanned from a printed source, and indeed it was — this photograph was a staged one created for a series of advertisements in Large magazine’s “For people who think bigger than they are” ad campaign, which featured depictions of people acting nobly in the face of adverse circumstances:

702,"### Context: The article discusses the FDA approval of a new anti-smoking drug called varenicline. The story mentions that the drug needs to be taken twice daily for a 12-week period, but it does not provide a cost comparison with existing treatments. The article does not embrace varenicline as a magic bullet and presents the numbers appropriately. However, it fails to provide a quantitative comparison of one-year abstinence rates with other drug and non-drug therapies. The article also does not mention any side effects of the drug, such as nausea, headaches, insomnia, and stomach problems, which were common in the varenicline group.

The design of the varenicline trials is not discussed, making it difficult to assess the strength of the information. The numbers presented in the article are from two well-designed randomized, double-blind trials with a total of 2000 participants. The trials evaluated abstinence rates between varenicline, bupropion (Zyban), and placebo groups at 12 weeks, followed by continuous abstinence for another 40 weeks.

The article does not show evidence of disease mongering, but it questions whether the 32 million people trying to quit smoking would need drug treatment. The prevalence rates of addicted smokers are provided by the Center for Disease Control. The data presented in the article is provided by Pfizer, the funder of the varenicline trials. Dr. Riggotti, an anti-smoking advocate, is cited in the article but is not affiliated with the varenicline study. The article suggests that another outside expert opinion would be appropriate if time allowed.

The article briefly mentions other drug treatments with similar one-year abstinence rates, such as nicotine replacement therapies. However, it does not mention the behavioral component of treatment or that varenicline was compared with bupropion in the trials. The article acknowledges that there are multiple available therapies for long-term smoking cessation, and varenicline is just one option.

The article mentions the recent FDA approval of varenicline but does not discuss when it will be available. The drug was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to its significant improvement over existing therapies. The article does not provide much discussion on how varenicline is different from nicotine itself, although it mentions that varenicline binds to the same receptor but is a partially active drug and does not bind to all nicotine receptor subtypes.

There is no evidence that the story relies solely on a press release, as there are sources cited who are not affiliated with the studies or Pfizer.
Claim: Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher’s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories.

However, the article criticizes the lack of evidence and unjustified language used in the study. The article points out that the study only hypothesizes that PV prevents the formation of amyloid chains with other proteins, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. It also highlights that the study was conducted in a laboratory setting and does not establish a cause and effect relationship between amyloid proteins and the development of neurologic diseases. The article questions the omission of potential harms and conflicts of interest in the study, as well as the lack of mention of alternative interventions for preventing neurodegenerative diseases. It suggests that the news release should have clearly stated that there are no proven interventions to prevent these diseases and that the study's findings are limited to in vitro experiments. The article also criticizes the use of unjustified language in the news release, such as implying that eating fish is the answer to preventing neurodegenerative diseases. It points out that the funding sources for the study and any conflicts among the researchers are not mentioned in the release. The article concludes by stating that the evidence for the benefits of fish consumption is limited to fish, not humans, and that even if it was in humans, the language used in the news release would still be unjustified.
Claim: Eating more fish could prevent Parkinson's disease
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The subtitle of this news release says the Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden) study “shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurologic health.” But this in vitro lab study only suggests that the fish protein, parvalbumin, binds to a particular human protein called “alpha-synuclein” which has been identified as forming amyloid chains in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The news release should have made it clear that studies of fish cannot be extrapolated to humans, and further, that no cause and effect relationship has been established between amyloid proteins and the development of any neurologic disease. Any news release touching on Parkinson’s disease — or any other of the neurodegenerative disorders that have no cure — is likely to draw a lot of attention from news organizations. Parkinson’s disease alone affects about 1 million Americans and 10 million people worldwide. Although this news release clearly states the disease has no cure, it is riddled with language that implies fish consumption inhibits amyloid formation and that amyloid formation “can be responsible for various diseases,” but that’s an unproven theory and not even addressed by this study. Our concern is that this framing will be adopted by unskeptical reporters and the cause and effect language will be erroneously adopted despite absolutely no evidence to support it.",Eating more fish could prevent Parkinson's disease,"This news release from the University of Michigan Health Lab describes a study that found a protein in fish, parvalbumin (PV), binds to amyloid proteins that are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The news release suggests that eating more fish could prevent Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The news release does not mention that the study was conducted in a laboratory setting and that the findings are limited to in vitro experiments. The news release also does not mention that the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.

704,"### Context: The claim that the Obama administration wants to pay for nationalized health care through a ""light switch tax"" is false. The tax in question is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, which Republicans argue would be passed on to consumers. However, economists have stated that this claim is incorrect and that the cost to consumers would be much lower. The MIT report cited by House Republicans estimated a net cost to individuals of $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family. The average annual cost over time in today's dollars is estimated to be $85 per person or $215.05 per household. This is a far cry from the $3,128 claimed by House Republicans. 

Furthermore, the claim that the cap-and-trade program would pay for nationalized health care is also false. Obama's health care proposal does not involve nationalizing health care, and the funding for health care reform would come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers. The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their statement to say that the cap-and-trade program would pay for ""increased spending"" rather than health care. However, they still refer to it as a ""light switch tax"" and claim that the entire cost would come from consumers.

The article concludes that the claim is a serious distortion in many ways. It is false to say that the money is being used for nationalized health care, inaccurate to call it a ""light switch tax,"" and incorrect to cite a precise tax of $3,128 without mentioning how the money would be returned to consumers. Economists have stated that the cost to consumers would be much lower than claimed by House Republicans. Therefore, the claim is deemed false.
Claim: The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year.
The claim veracity: false

705,"### Context: President Trump's proposed budget includes cuts to Medicare hospital payments, which has sparked criticism and concern. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of trying to ""ransack Medicare, Medicaid, and the health care of seniors and families."" However, the administration argues that the budget does not cut Medicare benefits but instead aims to make better use of taxpayers' dollars and reduce Medicare spending by lowering prescription drug costs. The budget calls for $845 billion in spending reductions to Medicare over 10 years, mainly by cutting future payments to hospitals and service providers. However, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found actual savings of $515 billion or $575 billion, depending on the calculation method. The proposed cuts have faced opposition, with the head of a major hospital association warning that they would have a ""devastating"" impact on care for seniors. Trump's plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act also involved major Medicaid cuts, but it failed to pass Congress. The proposed Medicare package would require approval from lawmakers. It is common for administrations to call for cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals, as even small reductions can add up to significant savings over time. The budget targets federal payments for uncompensated care, outpatient services, and graduate medical education, while exempting private Medicare Advantage plans favored by Republicans. Advocates for Medicare beneficiaries expressed both praise and concern, with AARP highlighting the need to address prescription drug prices but expressing concern about cuts to important programs for seniors. The impact of the proposed cuts on patient care is uncertain, and it remains to be seen whether Congress will approve them.
Claim: Trump’s cuts to Medicare hospital payments trigger an outcry.

706,"### Context: Rep. Tim Ryan claimed that for every dollar invested in Head Start, the economy receives a return of $5 to $7. To investigate the validity of this claim, researchers examined a paper by Jens Ludwig and Deborah A. Phillips, which conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the program. The study compared the performance of siblings who enrolled in Head Start with those who did not and found that children exposed to Head Start were more likely to compete for better jobs. The researchers also cited a study of Perry Preschool, a similar program in Michigan, which followed the progress of 3- and 4-year-olds through two years and examined their success rate until age 40. The researchers acknowledged that some of the data available for studying children from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s was limited, and that Head Start has changed over time, making it challenging to apply the data to current program participants. However, they concluded that the average cost of Head Start at $9,000 per child is likely to generate benefits in excess of costs in both the short- and long-term.

In March 2011, a letter signed by over 300 researchers supported the notion that Head Start is cost-effective, citing a $7 to $9 return for every dollar invested based on the findings of 12 different studies and reports. The letter also estimated that the program's required medical screenings, vaccinations, and emphasis on health reduced annual Medicaid expenses by $232 per family. Additionally, commentary on the Ludwig-Phillips paper suggested that Head Start might have underestimated its own effectiveness. W. Steven Barnett of Rutgers University cited studies of three different programs similar to Head Start, which found returns ranging from 2.5 to 1 to 16.1 to 1. These studies examined various categories, including earnings of individuals who went through the programs in early childhood.

Overall, Ryan's claim that for every dollar invested in Head Start, the economy receives a return of $5 to $7 is accurate. Multiple studies and reports support the notion that Head Start is cost beneficial, with estimates ranging from $2.50 to $16.10 for each dollar spent. However, it is important to consider that forecasting outcomes for current Head Start participants is challenging due to changes in the program over time.
Claim: For every dollar we invest in Head Start, we get $5 to $7 back into our economy.

707,"### Context: The article discusses a press release that claims oregano and thyme may hold the cure for wasting syndrome disease. However, the article points out several issues with the release. Firstly, there is no mention of the costs for the compounds or their identification, making it difficult to determine the cost of acquiring them. The release suggests the development of an over-the-counter drug, but no information is provided on the potential cost to patients. Additionally, the release lacks transparency in terms of how the measurements of exercise tolerance and muscle mass were acquired and which specific body muscles were referred to. 

Furthermore, the article highlights that the research was conducted in mice, not humans, which is not revealed until the sixth paragraph of the release. The experiments were done on sedentary mice, but it is unclear if this is an appropriate model for studying the human illness of cachexia. The release also fails to mention if it was published in a peer-reviewed journal or presented at a scientific meeting, which would provide credibility to the research. 

The article raises concerns about the lack of information regarding the funding of the research and any potential conflicts of interest. It is mentioned that the discovery has been licensed to a pharmaceutical firm, but there is no information on the researchers' affiliations or relationships with the company. 

Lastly, the article disputes the claim made in the release that there is no existing treatment for cachexia. It mentions the medication megase, which is used in HIV-related wasting and offered to cancer patients, as well as other interventions such as resistance exercise and a high-protein diet. 

Overall, the article criticizes the press release for its lack of transparency, inadequate information, and misleading claims. It suggests that the research is still in its early stages and not yet available to support the claims made in the release.
Claim: Oregano, Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This release suffers from over-reach and obfuscation — a bad combination. The release cites some pre-clinical animal research at the University of Iowa that suggests that components of the spices oregano and thyme may represent a “cure” for cachexia, a wasting disease that affects cancer patients and others with debilitating diseases. Unfortunately, readers aren’t told that the research was in mice — not humans — until very late in the release. There’s no information on whether the research has been published, or met any other form of peer review. (When we asked to see the study, the media relations team at the university declined and told us the research hadn’t been published.) The spice compounds referred to aren’t named, nor are cost or potential harms addressed. The release doesn’t explain who funded the research or disclose that the university has applied for a patent on the compound. It doesn’t note that the researcher quoted in the release is listed as the inventor on the patent application and would likely stand to benefit financially from its commercialization. The release does note that a pharmaceutical firm has been licensed to market a drug based on the research. Editor’s note: This news release raised serious questions about oversight of the University of Iowa’s research-related communications to the public. We blogged about those questions here but have yet to receive a satisfactory response from the university media relations team. Update 8/24/17: A response received from the university, more than two weeks after the initial request, raises additional serious questions about the university’s process for promoting research, which critics termed “utterly irresponsible.” We wrote about it here. Cachexia is a serious condition typified by chronic weight loss that can affect a patient’s nutritional status and ability to undergo or continue treatment. Striking those with chronic diseases, it weakens patients and in some cases can hasten their demise. If it could be thwarted by compounds from spices, that would represent a real boon. But this release — and the research it reports — does not provide readers with valid and adequate information. Unfortunately, it may play on the hopes of those afflicted with cachexia and their families, offering false hopes instead of new findings.","Oregano, Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease","This news release describes a study of two compounds found in oregano and thyme that appear to have reduced the muscle wasting that occurs in mice with cancer. The release does not mention that the study was done in mice, and it does not mention that the work was published in a journal that is not peer-reviewed. The release also does not mention that the work was done by researchers at a medical school that has a financial interest in the discovery, and that the discovery has been licensed to a pharmaceutical company. The release also does not mention that the study was funded by a company that makes a product containing the two compounds. The release also does not mention that there are other treatments for muscle wasting, and that the release’s claim that there is “no treatment” for cachexia is incorrect.

708,"### Context: The article discusses a meme that circulated on Facebook featuring a quote attributed to Winston Churchill about socialism. The quote, ""Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery,"" was used in the meme to suggest that Churchill's views were in contrast to those of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. However, the article explains that the quote was taken out of context and divorced from the actual legacy of Churchill.

The article provides the full context of Churchill's remarks, which were made in the post-war period when Britain was dependent on American aid. Churchill's comments were about the economic situation and the need for Britain to free itself from dependency on the United States. The article also highlights that Churchill's positions on socialism were not entirely opposed to Ocasio-Cortez's views. For example, Churchill supported the establishment of a national health service, similar to Ocasio-Cortez's advocacy for a public healthcare system.

The article also mentions that the quote used in the meme was an amalgamation of two separate comments made by Churchill. The first part of the quote, ""Socialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy,"" was from a speech in 1948 about British dependence on American aid. The second part of the quote, ""The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal sharing of miseries,"" was from a speech in 1945 about demobilization and returning to civilian life.

Overall, the article argues that the meme misrepresents Churchill's views on socialism and fails to provide the full context of his remarks. It also highlights the similarities between Churchill's positions and those of Ocasio-Cortez, particularly in regards to healthcare and taxation.

709,"### Context: The death toll from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in the town of Muzaffarpur, India has risen to 129 children. AES, also known as 'brain fever', is a fever that affects the central nervous system and is caused by various viruses. Symptoms include high fever, vomiting, seizures, paralysis, and coma, with infants and elderly people being particularly vulnerable. The precise causes of AES are not known, but it is believed to be linked to a ferocious heat-wave and possibly toxins in lychees, although many families have reported that their children had not eaten them recently.

Medical and government officials are facing criticism for their inability to contain the crisis. A team of experts, including doctors and paramedics, is working round the clock to control the spread of AES. Doctors from other parts of the country have been sent to Muzaffarpur to assist at the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital, where most of the affected children are being treated. However, the hospital had to evict sick inmates from a ward to accommodate the surge in AES patients.

Muzaffarpur experiences AES outbreaks almost every year during the summer when temperatures rise. Nearly half of the children in the town are underweight, and a similar number are stunted, making them more vulnerable to AES. The Bihar and federal governments have faced criticism for their inability to save children, and doctors and government officials have faced protests. In response, the Bihar government has suspended a doctor in Muzaffarpur for dereliction of duties.

India's Federal Health and Family Welfare Minister, Harsh Vardhan, who is a doctor himself, announced plans for the construction of a 100-bed pediatric intensive care unit in Muzaffarpur. However, no timeframe was given for its completion.

In summary, the death toll from AES in Muzaffarpur has risen to 129 children. The precise causes of AES are unknown, but it is believed to be linked to a heat-wave and possibly toxins in lychees. Medical and government officials are facing criticism for their handling of the crisis, and efforts are being made to control the spread of AES. Plans for a pediatric intensive care unit in Muzaffarpur have been announced, but no timeline has been provided.

710,"### Context: The claim that most chicken meat sold in the U.S. contains cancer-causing arsenic is mostly true in 2011, but it has been resolved. In 2011, the FDA conducted a study on the effect of an animal drug called Roxarson, or 3-Nitro, on chicken meat. The FDA allowed poultry producers to use the drug to prevent parasitic diseases in chickens, promote weight gain, and improve the color of chicken meat. The study found higher levels of inorganic arsenic in the livers of chickens treated with 3-Nitro compared to untreated chickens. However, the levels of inorganic arsenic found in chicken livers were very low and represented a very low health risk to people who eat chicken. The FDA's findings demonstrated a very low but avoidable public exposure to inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen.

In June 2011, Pfizer voluntarily suspended the sale of 3-Nitro due to the FDA's findings, resolving the issue. However, the eRumor resurfaced in early 2015, claiming that the FDA had just admitted that 70% of chicken meat sold in the U.S. contained arsenic. This claim is outdated and not accurate.

While the claims about 3-Nitro are outdated, there are other arsenic-based animal drugs approved for human consumption, according to the FDA. These include nitarsone, arsanilic acid, and carbarsone. However, current data indicate that only 3-Nitro and nitarsone products are being marketed. These drugs contain forms of organic arsenic, which is less toxic and not carcinogenic.

In conclusion, the claim that most chicken meat sold in the U.S. contains cancer-causing arsenic was true in 2011 due to the use of the animal drug 3-Nitro. However, the issue was resolved when Pfizer voluntarily suspended the sale of the drug. The claim resurfaced in 2015 but is outdated and not accurate. There are other arsenic-based animal drugs approved for human consumption, but they contain less toxic forms of arsenic.

712,"### Context: A total of 87 bills in 34 states are seeking to save money on prescription drugs, with six states considering bills that would allow drugs to be imported from Canada, where they are 30 percent cheaper. Vermont and Utah are among the states considering this proposal. Maryland is also looking at creating a commission to regulate drug costs. The nonpartisan National Academy for State Health Policy states that states have to balance budgets and are often surprised by mid-year increases in drug costs. The stakes are high for state governments, government employees, Medicaid recipients, and anyone else paying for prescription drugs. The federal government does not control drug prices, which are set by drug companies and are subject to costs and competition. Medicaid negotiates cheaper drugs for low-income Americans. Importing drugs from Canada could put downward pressure on domestic costs for all. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America argues that importing drugs would threaten people's health because quality could not be assured. However, safety has nothing to do with the potential for tainted drugs from Canada, according to Utah state Rep. Norm Thurston. Allowing patients to buy medication from countries with strict drug standards, such as Canada, has long been proposed in Washington but has been blocked by the powerful drug lobby. President Donald Trump has supported opening up imports, and in his State of the Union speech, he called drug prices an ""injustice"" and promised action this year. New Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has favored other steps to increase competition domestically. Federal law since 2003 has allowed the U.S. health secretary to give states permission to import drugs, but such permission has never been granted. Federal drug-import legislation, introduced by Vermont's independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders last year, is once again being considered by Congress. Many states are focused on their budgets, but New Hampshire is considering a proposal to ensure pharmacists can inform customers if they are getting the best deal. In Vermont, a Senate committee has approved a proposal to create a bulk purchasing program that would import drugs from Canada, following strict safety guidelines, so they could be distributed by pharmacies at a fraction of their American price. State Senate President Pro Tem Tim Ashe believes there is a bipartisan coalition that agrees that the American people are being ripped off by high drug prices.

713,"### Context: President Trump has announced that his administration is considering a payroll tax cut or relief to provide substantial economic relief in response to the coronavirus outbreak. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have stated that any payroll tax cut should be limited to those affected by the virus. They are also working on new legislation, which may include measures such as ensuring water supplies for those unable to pay their bills, expanded unemployment insurance, medical leave, and providing food for children who rely on school nutrition programs. Vice President Mike Pence has said that the administration is consulting Congress on providing paid sick leave to workers, an idea that Democrats have already been pushing for. The number of confirmed cases in the United States has reached 605, with 25 deaths. Worldwide, there have been 113,584 cases and 3,996 deaths. The Trump administration's response comes as stock markets have plunged and health officials are advising people to avoid cruise ships, air travel, and large public gatherings. The administration plans to meet with executives from the banking, hospital, and health insurance industries. While an across-the-board payroll tax cut has been discussed, some officials have advocated for specific tax credits, loans, or subsidies to certain industries or hard-hit areas. A payroll tax cut could encourage consumer spending and help households struggling to make payments or pay medical bills due to reduced work hours. As concerns over the virus grow, colleges and universities are being advised to consider bringing students studying abroad back home and cancel or postpone upcoming travel. Several U.S. universities are moving to virtual instruction or limiting gatherings on their campuses. Health officials are advising older Americans, especially those with chronic medical conditions, to avoid large social gatherings, cruise ships, and airline flights. Four Republican lawmakers have announced that they will self-quarantine after coming into contact with an attendee at a political conference who later tested positive for the virus. The outbreak, which originated in China, has spread to at least 105 countries and territories. Italy has extended restrictions on movement to the entire country, and Washington state is considering measures such as banning large gatherings. The hardest-hit place in the U.S. has been a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, where most of the 18 confirmed deaths in the state have occurred. In California, passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which had a coronavirus outbreak on board, will be offloaded and quarantined. California has over 100 confirmed cases, and New York state has 142 cases. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has asked employers to consider staggering workers' start times and allowing telecommuting to reduce crowding on public transport.

Over 110,000 people are currently in camps in Mozambique, and aid workers are preparing for the spread of disease, particularly cholera. A cholera response center has been established in Beira, although no cases have been confirmed yet. Basic services are being restored in Beira, with electricity restored to water pumping and treatment stations. Part of Beira's electricity supply has been restored, and the port and railway line have reopened. Repairs and bypasses are being constructed on the main road, EN6, which will allow for larger deliveries of essential supplies to flooded areas. The spread of malaria is also a concern due to the large expanses of standing water. The government is focused on saving lives and fighting corruption, despite the ongoing corruption scandal. Aid efforts include the deployment of two large field hospitals, water purification systems, and the use of drones to identify areas in need. The scale of the devastation is significant due to the saturation of the land from previous rains. A substantial amount of aid assets are now in Mozambique, and international assistance is crucial in responding to the crisis.

715,"### Context: A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that cognitive therapy, a form of talk therapy, was effective in treating patients with schizophrenia. The study involved low-functioning patients with chronic schizophrenia who were selected from the extreme end of the low-functioning continuum. The therapy involved weekly sessions with highly trained therapists and was found to be more effective than standard treatment. The researchers claimed that this therapy could replace current therapy and prevent expensive hospitalizations, but no cost-comparisons were made in the study. The article presents a series of success stories, but does not quantify the benefits reported in the trial. The limitations of the study design and the narrow selection of patients with extreme symptoms are glossed over, raising questions about the conclusions and the relevance of the results to typical patients. The study was conducted at a single center and the therapists involved were more highly trained than those seen in routine clinical care. The duration of the trial and the outcome measured were changed during the study, which raises concerns about the quality of the science and its applicability to routine clinical practice. The study population had other special characteristics, such as a high proportion of African-American participants and a gender imbalance, which further questions the generalizability of the results. The article does not mention who funded the trial, but the disclosure section of the journal article does not reveal any obvious serious conflicts. However, all of the quoted experts in the article use cognitive therapy in their practices, which may have limited critical examination of the trial's limitations. The article briefly mentions the strengths and weaknesses of drug treatment for schizophrenia, but does not provide a sense of the magnitude of their effects. It also notes the difficulty in finding therapists trained in cognitive therapy. The article places this trial in the context of a half-century of study of cognitive therapy and highlights that testing it with this type of patient is new. The article does not appear to rely on a news release.

716,"### Context: The article discusses the approval of a new cancer pill called crizotinib by the FDA. The pill is intended for use in a small subset of lung cancer patients who have tumors with a specific gene variant. The article mentions that the treatment is very expensive, costing about $9,600 per month. It also states that tumors shrank or stopped growing in just over half of the patients for nearly two years on average. However, the article points out that the drug label indicates that tumors disappeared in only three out of 255 patients. The article also mentions that the drug has some side effects, including vision disorders, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and inflammation of the lung tissue. It notes that the drug should not be used in pregnant women. The article criticizes the reporting of the benefits of the drug, stating that it provides an unbalanced view and does not include quotes from patients who had limited responses or serious side effects. It also mentions that the trials conducted by Pfizer included only 255 patients and did not include any comparison to standard treatment. The article suggests that the drug received conditional approval because there is a reasonable likelihood of benefit, but the true benefit will not be known until ongoing trials are completed. The article also mentions that the drug is still on trial and may be withdrawn or modified if postmarketing trials fail to verify its clinical benefit. It points out that the gene test used in combination with the drug is the truly novel part of the treatment and that it is the second targeted therapy approved by the FDA this year. The article concludes by stating that it appears to rely entirely on a conference call arranged by Pfizer, which may have influenced the reporting.
Claim: Pfizer: New cancer pill gives hope, new strategy
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story paraphrases sources saying the approval of Xalkori (Pfizer’s brand name for a pill containing crizotinib) “proves the value of precisely targeting rare diseases linked to gene variants.” It is not clear if that phrase refers to the value for patients or company shareholders, because the next paragraph says this drug “epitomizes drugmakers’ new strategy of developing very expensive but effective medicines for relatively few patients to replace the blockbusters for the masses now getting competition from generic drugs.” This story would have been better if it had focused on how the FDA has decided to offer some novel combinations of tumor gene tests and therapies to selected patients based on suggestive results from small, preliminary trials, and then requiring applicants to complete conventional randomized controlled trials in order to keep the drug on the    market. It should also have given readers some of the context available in documents posted online by the FDA, Pfizer and other sources about the state of the science regarding this drug. On the plus side, the story makes clear that this drug is meant for a small and very specific group of patients. It also is clear about the high cost of the therapy. People with often-deadly diseases such as advanced lung cancer are hungry for new treatments. Journalists have a responsibility to put preliminary suggestions of progress toward new treatments in the proper context. In this case, the story should have been more clear about tentative nature of the evidence supporting use of a new drug in certain patients and that continued use all depends on the results of trials that are still underway.","Pfizer: New cancer pill gives hope, new strategy","This story reports on the FDA approval of a new drug for a rare form of lung cancer.

717,"### Context: Scientists have released the final results from NASA's ""twins study,"" which tracked the biological consequences of spaceflight in genetic doubles. The study focused on astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent 340 days at the International Space Station, and his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who remained on Earth. The study aimed to identify potential risks of longer-duration spaceflight. The findings, published in the journal Science, revealed several key findings. Firstly, Scott Kelly's telomeres, the protective ends of chromosomes, got longer in space, which was unexpected. However, most of his telomeres returned to preflight average upon returning to Earth. Secondly, while Scott Kelly's DNA was not mutated in space, the activity of many of his genes changed, especially in the last half of the voyage. Immune system genes were particularly affected, with some remaining hyperactive six months later. Other findings included changes in the structure of Scott Kelly's eye and thickening of his retina, suggesting symptoms of ""spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome,"" and some chromosomal instability that may reflect radiation exposure in space. The study also found that a flu shot given in space worked as well as one on Earth. Scott Kelly aced cognitive tests in space but slowed down after his return, possibly due to increased distractions. The study involved collecting months' worth of blood, urine, and fecal samples, as well as cognitive and physical tests and ultrasound scans. Researchers used portable DNA-sequencing equipment to analyze genomic data. The study's findings will help inform future missions, such as trips to Mars. Researchers cautioned that studying one pair of twins cannot prove the risks of spaceflight, and longer missions will mean greater stress and radiation exposure. Future studies will involve studying 10 additional astronauts on yearlong missions. NASA plans to conduct more one-year missions in the future.

The teenager, Maddie Kelley, claims that her mother had beaten her badly enough to cause bruises and had hit her head against the wall. The video in question was originally shared to the Facebook page “Concerned citizens against Judge Grubbs Cobb County GA” in January 2016; the reasons for its renewed popularity in January 2018 are unclear: This judge put me back with my mom Tha abuses me Posted by Maddie Kelley on Monday, January 11, 2016 Some commenters posted screenshots of what appeared to be a deleted post originally shared by the Adairsville Police Department in January 2016, saying that the child welfare officials and police had found the claims to be unsubstantiated:  On 25 January 2018, the Adairsville Police Department’s official page responded to comments from one of many people still concerned about Maddie Kelley’s welfare:  We contacted the Adairsville Police Department to ask whether there were any further updates, and they responded:

719,"### Context: Dr. Keith Albow wrote a column in February 2017 defending President Trump's mental stability and intelligence. Although he has never personally examined Trump, Albow argued that Trump's success in business, his strong family relationships, and his ability to defeat opponents in the political arena all suggest that he is mentally stable. Albow also pointed to the stock market rally after Trump's inauguration as evidence of his sanity. The column was widely circulated and described as a letter by Albow, but it was actually an op-ed published by Fox News.

Albow has openly supported Trump and opposed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. In another column, he criticized Clinton's psychological makeup, arguing that her penchant for lying is a result of her lack of empathy and inability to resonate with others. Albow's opinions on both Trump and Clinton were made without personally examining them, which goes against the American Psychology Association's ""Goldwater Rule"" that prohibits mental health professionals from rendering opinions without first examining their subjects.

It is important to note that Albow's opinions are his personal views and not medical assessments. Claims made by mental health professionals about politicians without examining them should be considered personal opinions rather than medical diagnoses.

720,"### Context: According to a fact-check by Africa Check, the claim that a child dies every minute in Africa due to malaria is not entirely accurate. The correct number is closer to once every two minutes. The President's Malaria Initiative, one of the government's largest global health efforts, stated that a child dies every minute in Africa because of the disease. However, USAID, another organization involved in malaria advocacy, clarified that the correct number is once every two minutes. The exact death toll makes little difference as Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria, with 90% of all deaths worldwide and almost as large a percentage of active cases. Malaria is particularly lethal for pregnant women and their babies, with an estimated 10,000 expectant mothers dying each year in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the disease. Another 200,000 children die prematurely from complications caused by their mothers having bouts of malaria during pregnancy. The World Health Organization provides a range of estimates for malaria deaths in children under 5 in Africa, with the middle estimate showing that one child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds, or close to once every two minutes. The U.S. government has allocated approximately $860 million this fiscal year to fight malaria, with a focus on providing drugs, insecticide-treated nets, and indoor spraying to prevent the disease. President Obama aims to increase this funding by about $70 million in the last budget of his administration. While progress has been made in reducing the rate of new malaria cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, challenges remain, including mosquito resistance to insecticides, weak healthcare systems, and the presence of counterfeit drugs. In conclusion, while the exact death rate from malaria in Africa may vary, it remains a significant threat to children in the region.
Claim: In Africa, a child dies every minute because of (malaria).
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Ziemer wrote that malaria kills a child in Africa each minute. His staff at USAID said that figure is off. A better estimate is that a child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds. But even that figure comes with a measure of uncertainty. The actual death rate could be higher or lower. By any estimate, malaria remains a serious threat to children in Africa.","In Africa, a child dies every minute because of (malaria).","Africa Check says """"In Africa, a child dies every two minutes because of malaria."""" The U.S. government says it’s """"once every two minutes."""" The United Nations says it’s """"once every 1 minute 48 seconds.""""

721,"### Context: Turkey's Health Minister, Fahrettin Koca, announced that the country has ordered rapid testing kits from China, as well as medicine that has been used to treat coronavirus patients. However, he did not provide specific details about the treatments. Koca stated that masks produced in Turkey will not be exported while they are needed domestically.

As of Monday, Turkey's death toll from the coronavirus has increased to 37, with the number of confirmed cases rising to 1,529. Koca mentioned that the majority of cases were initially from abroad, but the virus has now spread across the whole country. He also mentioned that some patients have recovered, but did not provide further information.

To address the increasing number of cases, Turkey has activated rapid test kits. 50,000 kits have arrived from China, and an additional 300,000 kits are expected on Thursday. The country has made arrangements to use up to one million kits. Koca also mentioned that some medical staff have been infected.

In an effort to ensure an adequate supply of masks, Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu stated that authorities have raided warehouses storing masks. If local producers do not agree to sell masks to the health ministry by Monday night, the government will seize their factories. Turkish producers have been exporting medical gear, including masks, to various countries, but the government has increased controls on the trade to meet domestic demands. Last week, the government implemented a requirement for a doctor's prescription for certain masks to limit private sales.

Additionally, Soylu mentioned that 10,750 people have been quarantined across the country, and anyone violating the quarantine will face fines.

In summary, Turkey is taking measures to address the coronavirus outbreak. They have ordered rapid testing kits and medicine from China, and masks produced in Turkey will not be exported. The government is also cracking down on mask hoarding and increasing controls on the trade. Quarantines are being enforced, and violators will face fines.

722,"### Context: The article discusses a study that claims a five-minute neck scan can detect dementia 10 years earlier. The study measured forward compression waves (FCW) in the neck arteries, which indicate irregular blood flow. People with intense FCW were found to be up to 50% more likely to suffer from reduced cognitive functions. However, the article points out that the study is observational, so cause-and-effect conclusions cannot be drawn. It also highlights the need for future research and the limitations of the study.

The article raises concerns about the cost of the scan, as online estimates range from $200 to $800, but does not provide any specific information on the cost. It also questions whether doctors can truly spot dementia earlier based solely on FCW and whether identifying this risk allows patients to take action to improve their cognitive outcomes.

The article emphasizes the potential harm of incorrect results from the scan, such as false positives and false negatives, which could lead to individuals thinking they are at high risk of dementia when they are not or vice versa. It suggests that the sensitivity and specificity of the test should have been discussed to address these concerns.

The article also notes that the study does not address conflicts of interest, as several researchers have ties to The Brain Protection Company, which has patents related to dementia treatment. It questions whether the company may potentially benefit from the findings.

Furthermore, the article points out that the study does not provide context on previous research regarding FCW and dementia. It does not mention if this is the first study to find a pattern between the two.

Overall, the article highlights the need for more research and caution in interpreting the results of the study. It raises important questions about the cost, potential harm, and conflicts of interest associated with the neck scan.
Claim: Five-minute neck scan can spot dementia 10 years earlier, say scientists
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story focuses on research presented a conference that found increased intensity of “forward compression waves” (FCWs) in the carotid artery was associated with an increased risk of dementia later in life. The story didn’t tell readers this was an observational study–cause-and-effect couldn’t be established. Also, there is no discussion of the risks of this kind of screening test, notably the risk of false positives and false negatives. The study does not, as the headline states, allow doctors to “spot dementia 10 years earlier.” This is an important distinction. Identifying important risk factors for dementia can be valuable, in part because it gives patients opportunities to make lifestyle changes that may reduce that risk. On the other hand, telling readers that a test can spot dementia “10 years earlier” makes it sound as if the outcome is a foregone conclusion.","Five-minute neck scan can spot dementia 10 years earlier, say scientists","This story reports on a study that found a pattern in the neck arteries of people who went on to develop dementia. The story does a good job of explaining the study and the pattern that was found. However, the story should have been more clear about the limitations of the study and the potential harms of the test. The story also should have addressed the potential conflicts of interest of the researchers. Dementia is a serious condition that affects millions of people. A simple, non-invasive test that can detect the disease early would be a boon to public health. However, the test described in this story is still in the early stages of research and it is not clear if it will ever be ready for prime time."
723,"### Context: The article discusses a lawsuit filed by Sheronda Braker, the fiancée of Westfield High School Principal Derrick Nelson, who died after lapsing into a coma during a bone marrow procedure at Hackensack University Medical Center. Nelson, who was 44 years old and had a 5-year-old daughter with Braker, had planned to donate bone marrow to a French teenager he did not know. They were connected through Be the Match, a bone marrow registry network. It is unclear if the teen received any bone marrow from Nelson due to privacy obligations.

Nelson, who also served as an officer in the Army Reserve for over 20 years, had several health issues that complicated the planned donation. His sleep apnea prevented the use of general anesthesia, so doctors were supposed to harvest stem cells intravenously. However, during a physical exam, it was discovered that Nelson had the sickle cell trait, which meant they couldn't harvest the stem cells. They decided to proceed with the bone marrow surgery under a local anesthetic.

The lawsuit alleges that the hospital was negligent because staff continued to administer anesthesia while Nelson's oxygen level decreased and failed to provide him with additional oxygen. The National Marrow Donor Program states that bone marrow donation is considered a low-risk procedure, with only 2.4% of donors experiencing serious complications.

Nelson's fiancée describes him as a generous and loving person who wanted to make a difference. He had recently re-enlisted in the Army Reserve and was set to marry Braker on June 29. Braker mentions that his tuxedo remains in a box in her house.

Hackensack Meridian Health, the parent company of Hackensack University Medical Center, released a statement expressing condolences and acknowledging Nelson's legacy as an educator and veteran. They stated that they are unable to provide further information due to the ongoing litigation process but have been in communication with the family through their legal representation.

The article concludes with a quote from David Mazie, the attorney representing Nelson's family, who describes Nelson as a hero and states that the family filed the lawsuit to seek justice.

725,"### Context: Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic candidate for Senate in Texas, held a campaign event at a Willie Nelson concert where he appealed to voters from both parties and independents. O'Rourke expressed his support for universal healthcare, gay rights, and combating climate change. He also criticized President Trump's calls for a border wall and the federal government's war on drugs, which he believes disproportionately targets minorities and the poor. O'Rourke has refused donations from political action committees and has focused on fundraising from individual donors. He has enjoyed significant fundraising success, outpacing his opponent, Republican Senator Ted Cruz. O'Rourke's move to the left contrasts with other Democrats running in red-state Senate races who have embraced more moderate positions. Despite this, O'Rourke has distanced himself from the national Democratic Party, but not from his liberal views. He has previously suggested that he is open to abolishing ICE and impeaching President Trump. O'Rourke's second debate with Cruz was postponed, but during their first debate, both candidates focused on issues that excite their bases rather than attracting moderates. O'Rourke's strategy breaks from previous Texas Democrats who have tried to run as moderates and failed. The article also mentions that the idea that only conservative Democrats have a chance of flipping a state like Texas is changing, particularly on social issues such as medical marijuana. Willie Nelson, the iconic musician, is a longtime advocate for marijuana legalization and has founded his own cannabis company. Some detractors have criticized Nelson for supporting O'Rourke, but he has shrugged off the criticism.

728,"### Context: The article discusses a study involving the immuno-drug Bavencio, developed by Merck KGaA, and the anti-cancer drug Inlyta, developed by Pfizer, which has shown promise in alleviating kidney cancer. However, the article raises concerns about the lack of information provided, particularly regarding the cost, dosages used in the study, and potential harms associated with the drugs. The article also criticizes the lack of independent sources and context provided in the story.

The article highlights that the cost of Bavencio can be over $1,600 for 10 milliliters, while 180 one-milligram tablets of Inlyta can cost over $15,000. However, the dosages used in the study are not mentioned. The article also points out that the story does not specify the extent of the benefits or the duration of progression-free survival.

Furthermore, the potential harms associated with Bavencio, such as lung, liver, and kidney problems, and Inlyta, such as heart failure and serious bleeding, are not addressed in the story. The article argues that this is unacceptable since both drugs are already on the market.

The lack of information about the ongoing study is also criticized. The article questions the number of patients enrolled, the inclusion of a control group receiving Sutent, and the absence of information about other potential treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma. The story does not provide any context for the research, such as the availability of treatment options or the significance of combining immunotherapy and anti-cancer drugs.

The article suggests that the story appears to be solely based on a news release from Merck KGaA, the maker of Bavencio, and does not involve any independent reporting. It also notes that the story does not mention that Bavencio is currently used for treating a skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.

In conclusion, the article criticizes the lack of information, cost analysis, potential harms, independent sources, and context provided in the story about the study involving Bavencio and Inlyta for kidney cancer. It suggests that the story seems to be based solely on a news release from Merck KGaA, without any additional reporting.

Turkey has implemented several measures to contain the virus, including limiting the use of public spaces, imposing a partial curfew on the elderly, closing schools, cafes, and bars, banning mass prayers, and suspending sports matches and flights. The closure of all schools has been extended until April 30, with home schooling continuing during this period. Education Minister Ziya Selcuk assured that efforts would be made to meet all educational needs. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca explained that the school closure is a preventive measure to protect families.

In terms of treatment, Turkey has imported medicine from China that is believed to help with the treatment of coronavirus patients. The medication has already been administered to 136 patients in intensive care. Koca stated that experts and officials will examine the medicine's impact in the coming days. Additionally, 26 patients have recovered from the virus as of Tuesday, including two senior citizens.

Overall, Turkey is taking significant measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus. President Erdogan is optimistic that by breaking the speed of the virus' spread in two to three weeks, Turkey can minimize the damage caused by the outbreak. The closure of schools has been extended until April 30, with efforts being made to ensure educational needs are met. Turkey has also imported medicine from China to treat coronavirus patients, with initial administration showing promise.

730,"### Context: The article discusses a press release about a study that claims concussions in children can be detected by a blood test. The release states that the blood test is not ready for clinical use but hopes to be commercially available within the next five years. It mentions that the test correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries 94% of the time and that the levels of GFAP in the blood corresponded to the severity of the injuries. However, the release only focuses on the positive predictive value of the test and does not address the potential harms of false positives. The release also mentions the possibility of using the blood test to make brain injury diagnoses on the spot, but the study notes that GFAP is detectable in the bloodstream within one hour of injury, raising questions about the timing of the test. The release does not provide important aspects of the study, such as the fact that the study was conducted on 257 children, of which 152 received CT scans and 18 were found to have traumatic intracranial lesions. The release also notes that the lead author of the study receives funding from the NIH and is a scientific consultant for a company that has intellectual property rights to GFAP testing, which could be a potential conflict of interest. The release does not mention other research on biomarkers for concussion detection or the existing body of literature on GFAP and brain injury. The article criticizes the release for using hyperbole and not providing enough context or validation for the findings. It concludes by stating that further study is required to validate the findings before clinical application.
Claim: Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.",Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test,"This news release describes a study that identified a biomarker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), that could be used to detect traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children.

731,"### Context: The claim that more women are victims of domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday than on any other day of the year is a myth. This article discusses how this false statistic became widely believed and spread. In January 1993, a news conference was held by a coalition of women's groups in Pasadena, California, where they claimed that Super Bowl Sunday is ""the biggest day of the year for violence against women."" They cited anecdotal evidence and a study from Virginia's Old Dominion University to support their claim. The media coverage of this conference, along with warnings sent to at-risk women, further propagated the idea that sports fans are prone to attack their wives or girlfriends on Super Bowl Sunday.

However, when a reporter from the Washington Post investigated the sources behind these claims, he found that the study from Old Dominion University did not support the 40 percent increase in violence against women on Super Bowl Sundays. The study found that the number of women admitted to the emergency room for various injuries was slightly higher on win days, but not significantly different overall. Additionally, the claim made by Dobisky Associates that Super Bowl Sunday is the day when hotlines and shelters receive the most reports of domestic violence was not supported by any systematic data.

Further investigations and reports from various cities and domestic violence counselors found no significant increase in domestic violence cases on Super Bowl Sunday. Studies have shown that domestic violence does not peak on any specific day but may rise during certain times of the year, such as major holidays like Christmas.

Despite the lack of evidence supporting the claim, the myth of Super Bowl Sunday violence against women continues to be widely cited and believed. The article concludes that believing in this false statistic does not make the world a better place for women.
Claim: More women are victims of domestic violence on Super Bowl Sunday than on any other day of the year.

However, it does mention various instances of hoax messages circulating on Facebook warning users not to accept friend requests from specific individuals who are claimed to be hackers. These messages typically state that if a user accepts a friend request from the alleged hacker, their computer and Facebook account will be compromised. 

The article explains that these messages are long-running hoaxes and are not based on factual information. They are often circulated with different names and variations, with pranksters inserting the names and addresses of their acquaintances into the warning. The article emphasizes that while it is possible for email messages or links on Facebook to carry viruses that can infect computers, the specific warnings mentioned in the claim can be safely dismissed as jokes.

The article also mentions that similar hoax messages have been circulated in different languages and countries, with different names being used as the alleged hackers. It provides examples of some of these variations, including warnings about hackers named Fabrizio Brambilla, Jayden K. Smith, Anwar Jitou, and others.

In summary, the article does not directly address the claim about accepting friend requests from strangers providing hackers with access to computers and online accounts. However, it explains that the specific warnings mentioned in the claim are long-running hoaxes and should not be taken seriously.

733,"### Context: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush claims that ""too many"" tattoos ""on visible body parts"" are causing the military to reject applicants. The Army overhauled its appearance policy in 2014, which includes rules about tattoos. The policy prohibits tattoos on certain areas of the body, such as the wrists, hands, fingers, head, face, and neck. Soldiers are allowed to have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow or below the knee. Under the new policy, 2,919 applicants were unable to proceed due to their tattoos. However, tattoos are not the number one disqualifier for applicants. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct, or a combination of these issues disqualify more applicants. The Air Force, Marines, and Navy also have their own tattoo policies, generally banning tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination, or express offensive views. The Air Force policy includes a measurement guide to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. The Marines policy requires administrative review for applicants with more than four tattoos. The Navy's policy is the least detailed but also bans head tattoos. Overall, the claim made by Jeb Bush is supported by the fact that the military does reject applicants with ""too many"" tattoos on visible body parts.
Claim: Too many"" tattoos ""on visible body parts"" keep some applicants out of the military.

The claim originated from an email that circulated after the shooting, suggesting a link between Hasan and President Obama's administration. The email referenced a document published by the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute, which listed Hasan as a participant in a conference. However, the article clarifies that Hasan attended the conference as an audience member and not as an invited advisor. The think tank confirmed that Hasan registered for the event on his own and was not affiliated with the institute or the university. The article emphasizes that the task force mentioned in the document has no connection to the White House and was established before Obama took office. The author of the article, Jerome Corsi, also clarifies in his story that the task force was a university-based advisory group and did not play any formal role in the official Obama transition. The article concludes that while Hasan attended a meeting relevant to his profession, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was an advisor to the Obama administration or that the task force was involved with the White House.

735,"### Context: North Carolina's Health Secretary, Mandy Cohen, claims that there is a ""direct correlation"" between the state's mask requirement and the stabilization of COVID-19 cases. Data shows that the number of new reported cases is beginning to stabilize. However, experts say it is difficult to quantify the impact of the mask requirement. The mask requirement was announced on June 24 and went into effect on June 26. Cohen judged the rule's effectiveness three weeks after its implementation because it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear after someone is infected. Therefore, someone could have contracted the virus before the mask mandate but not shown symptoms or tested positive until after the requirement was in effect.

The average number of new cases per day in North Carolina rose until July 18 and then started to drop. The rolling 7-day average has been less than 2,000 cases ever since. While there is evidence that widespread mask-wearing helps reduce the spread of the virus, experts say there is not enough evidence yet to determine the influence of the mask rule on the stabilization of cases. Other factors such as social distancing and testing availability could also play a role. Reviewing the data typically takes months, and there are many variables that need to be accounted for.

Experts agree that it is premature to directly credit the mask rule for the leveling-off of cases. However, they believe Cohen's claim is fair given the evidence that masks work and considering other factors that may have contributed to the stabilization. It is difficult to separate the impact of a single intervention from other public health behaviors. The mask requirement may have prompted more people to wear masks and take other precautionary measures as well.

As of August 3, North Carolina's rolling 7-day average remained below 2,000 cases and was still declining. While there appears to be a correlation between the mask requirement and the stabilization of cases, it is too early to draw conclusions. Verifying the strength of the correlation can take months. Overall, Cohen's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

736,"### Context: The claim that a megalodon capsized a South African charter vessel in April 2013 is not supported by any credible evidence. The article states that the South African press did not report on such an event, and there is no physical evidence or reliable news sources documenting the incident. The episode of Discovery Channel's ""Shark Week"" that featured this claim was found to be fictionalized and lacked hard science and credible evidence. The researchers portrayed in the episode were actors, and the program included a disclaimer stating that it used dramatized events and characters. Legitimate scientists do not consider the possibility of megalodons still existing to be a subject of genuine inquiry or controversy. The article also mentions that the existence of a legendary 35-foot monster shark called ""Submarine"" is highly controversial and largely based on hearsay and rumor. Another episode of ""Shark Week"" featured claims of Submarine deliberately attacking a ship off the coast of South Africa, but there is no actual physical evidence supporting the existence of such a creature. The article criticizes Discovery Channel for presenting these fictionalized stories instead of focusing on the real science and fascinating aspects of megalodons. The author argues that there is plenty of actual scientific information about megalodons that could have been presented to educate viewers. Overall, the claim that a megalodon capsized a South African charter vessel in April 2013 is not supported by any credible evidence and is likely a fabrication presented in a fictionalized television program.

The passengers were taken into a two-week quarantine upon arrival in the United States. However, 14 passengers who tested positive for the virus were allowed to board the planes, potentially exposing other passengers for about 40 minutes before being isolated. The total number of coronavirus cases in mainland China has risen to 70,635, with a slight increase in new cases compared to the previous day. Chinese authorities claim that measures taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect, but it is still too early to determine the containment of the outbreak. The epidemic is affecting a small proportion of people, both within China and in other countries. China has implemented lockdown measures in Wuhan and other cities, but is under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work. The country's central bank has cut interest rates and announced plans for tax and fee cuts, but economists still expect a slowdown in economic growth. The article also mentions the situation on the cruise ship Westerdam, which was turned away from ports in Southeast Asia before docking in Cambodia. One American passenger from the Westerdam tested positive for the virus in Malaysia. Authorities are trying to trace other passengers from the ship. The impact of the virus is expected to show up in the Japanese economy, with fears of a recession. Singapore has downgraded its economic growth forecast and is preparing measures to cushion the blow. The Tokyo Marathon has been limited to top-level athletes, excluding 38,000 general participants. Emperor Naruhito's public birthday address in Japan has been canceled.

739,"### Context: A recent study has shown that the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, can increase survival among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study compared nivolumab to another treatment called everolimus and found that nivolumab increased median overall survival by 5.4 months. However, the article questions whether this small increase in survival time can be considered a breakthrough. The article also criticizes the news release for not providing enough information about the side effects of the treatments. It notes that treatment-related adverse events occurred in 79% of patients treated with nivolumab and 88% of patients treated with everolimus. The article also mentions that the study was funded by the manufacturer of nivolumab and that one of the researchers is a consultant to the company, which is important context. The article points out that other therapies have been approved for the treatment of advanced RCC, but does not provide a true comparison of these options. It also notes that nivolumab is currently used to treat metastatic melanoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer, but does not mention the availability of everolimus. The article criticizes the language used in the news release, which it considers hyperbolic given the small magnitude of the benefit. However, it acknowledges that the term ""breakthrough"" is consistent with the FDA designation of nivolumab as a ""Breakthrough Therapy."" The article concludes by reminding readers that the Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of clinical benefit in serious diseases.
Claim: Breakthrough study demonstrates survival advantage with immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced kidney cancer patients
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"News releases from academic centers can fall victim to the hyperbole and excessive optimism often seen in the commercial realm. This release from MD Anderson Cancer Center avoids the worst excesses and we liked much of what was written, including the description of the study design and quantification of the survival benefit. But some important omissions are evident. We can perhaps forgive the release for not including a discussion of cost. But there were other significant deficiencies, including lack of a meaningful discussion on potential harms of the treatment, no mention of the study funding source, and no disclosure that the principal investigator (quoted extensively in the release) is a consultant to the manufacturer of nivolumab. These are important elements to help readers understand the true extent of this “breakthrough.”  Although a somewhat uncommon form of cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an important topic. As is noted by the news release, a significant number of patients with the disease present with metastases making treatment difficult. Existing therapies are not ideal with only moderate improvements in survival. The demonstration of an immunotherapy for RCC that is more effective than existing treatments is encouraging. We should note that the “breakthrough designation” from the FDA  is “… intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with early signals of potential clinical benefit in serious diseases to help ensure patients have access to new therapies as soon as possible” (our emphasis added).",Breakthrough study demonstrates survival advantage with immune checkpoint inhibitor for advanced kidney cancer patients,"This news release describes a study of 516 patients with advanced kidney cancer who were treated with either the drug nivolumab or the drug everolimus. The release reports that the patients treated with nivolumab had a 5.4-month increase in median overall survival. The release does a good job of describing the study and the benefits of treatment. However, it doesn’t provide enough information about the side effects of the drugs, and it uses language that is overly optimistic given the small magnitude of the benefit. The news release also neglects to mention that the study was funded by the manufacturer of nivolumab, and that one of the researchers is a consultant to the company. Advanced kidney cancer is a serious disease that affects many people. It is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with an estimated 62,700 new cases in 2016. The 5-year survival rate is 10.2 percent. The FDA has approved several therapies for the treatment of advanced RCC, but it is not clear how nivolumab compares to these other options."
740,"### Context: In a national address, President Donald Trump called on Congress to provide $5.7 billion for a border wall to address what he called a “crisis” on the border. However, the article highlights several false and misleading claims made by the president.

Firstly, while it is true that the number of people caught trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally has risen in recent months, the total remains far below what it was several years ago. The average monthly number of apprehensions during the first 11 months of 2018 was not much above what it was in Barack Obama’s last year in office, and it was less than one-third of what it had been in 2000.

Secondly, Trump claimed that Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter the country every day. However, in October and November, Border Patrol made 102,857 apprehensions at the Southwest border, which works out to roughly 1,700 apprehensions each day. Including individuals who lawfully tried to enter through a port of entry only increases the figure to over 1,400 per day.

Thirdly, Trump suggested that 20,000 children were illegally brought into the country last month by “vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs,” but there is no evidence of that in the available statistics. In November, 25,172 family units were apprehended by the Border Patrol, but the number of suspected fraudulent cases of adults trafficking children was a small fraction of all family unit apprehensions.

Furthermore, Trump claimed that the border wall would quickly pay for itself by stopping the flow of illegal drugs. However, the majority of illicit drugs are smuggled through legal ports of entry, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The wall would not do much to stop drugs.

Lastly, Trump continued to claim that Mexico would indirectly pay for the border wall through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new trade deal. However, economists argue that the trade agreement won't generate enough additional federal revenues to pay for the wall, and there is nothing in the agreement specifying that Mexico will pay for it.

In conclusion, the article highlights the false and misleading claims made by President Trump regarding the border wall and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of apprehensions is not as high as claimed, there is no evidence of 20,000 children being illegally brought into the country, the wall would not effectively stop the flow of drugs, and the trade agreement with Mexico does not specify that they will pay for the wall.

741,"### Context: Medical device company Medtronic is recalling its heparin-coated bypass equipment as a precautionary measure. The devices are coated with Medtronic's Carmeda BioActive surface, which includes heparin to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing bypass procedures. The company has not received any reports of physical harm related to the contamination of its Carmeda products. The coating is used on various disposable products used during bypass surgery, such as blood oxygenators, reservoirs, and pumps.

Medtronic stated that the recalled products have relatively small sales. However, a separate line of disposable bypass-surgery products called Trillium, which is coated with a different biosurface and contains smaller amounts of heparin, will remain on the market.

The recall was prompted by a recommendation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 8. The FDA advised that medical devices using heparin should be tested to ensure they are not contaminated with harmful substances. This recommendation came after reports of serious injuries and deaths in patients who had received injectable heparin products containing high levels of a contaminant called oversulfated chondroitin sulfate.

The FDA has received reports that at least 81 U.S. patients who died had been exposed to tainted heparin. These patients experienced severe allergic reactions, including a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the larynx, and other severe symptoms. The contaminated heparin led to a recall by manufacturer Baxter International and caused tensions between the United States and China, where much of the world's heparin supply is produced.

The chondroitin contaminant, derived from animal cartilage, has a similar structure to heparin, which is obtained from pig intestines. This similarity makes it difficult to identify the contaminant using standard tests for heparin batches.

In summary, Medtronic is recalling its heparin-coated bypass equipment as a precautionary measure following the FDA's recommendation to test heparin-containing medical devices for contamination. The recall is in response to reports of serious injuries and deaths caused by tainted heparin, which led to a recall by Baxter International and strained relations between the U.S. and China.

743,"### Context: The article claims that the Arch of Baal, a replica of Palmyra's Triumphal Arch, was erected on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. at the same time that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh were testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The article suggests that this timing is not a coincidence and implies that the arch is a symbol related to abortion laws and the future of the Supreme Court.

However, the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA), which unveiled the replica, has a different purpose. The IDA uses advanced technology to recreate ancient structures and preserve cultural heritage. When the original Monumental Arch in Syria was destroyed by ISIS, the IDA set out to recreate a portion of it as a way to show that anything destroyed by extremists can be rebuilt. The replica of the arch has been displayed in various cities around the world, including New York, London, Florence, and Dubai.

The unveiling of the arch in Washington, D.C. was attended by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel. The IDA works closely with organizations like the United Nations, UNESCO, and major universities to document, preserve, and reconstruct heritage objects.

The article concludes by quoting IDA Director Roger Michel, who states that it is fitting for the arch to be in Washington, D.C., a symbol of representative democracy. Ranking Member Eliot Engel also emphasizes the importance of projects like the recreation of the Arch of Palmyra in celebrating iconic pieces and keeping them alive in our collective consciousness.

In summary, the article's claim that the Arch of Baal was erected on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. at the same time as the testimonies of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is true. However, the article's implication that the timing is not a coincidence and that the arch is a symbol related to abortion laws and the Supreme Court is not supported by the information provided. The Institute for Digital Archaeology, which unveiled the replica, focuses on preserving cultural heritage and using technology to recreate ancient structures.

744,"### Context: The article titled ""Heart Device Cuts Death Rate"" discusses a study that found a new heart device to be effective in reducing death rates and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. The device, called a pacemaker-defibrillator, costs up to $35,000, compared to the standard defibrillator which costs around $25,000. However, when factoring in hospital and doctor fees, the total cost can exceed $50,000.

The article highlights that the cost of heart failure treatment is estimated to be $40 billion annually, but it is unclear who bears this cost. The article suggests that the device may be considered a bargain if it can reduce the overall cost of heart failure treatment.

The study showed that patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms had a 25% relative reduction in death or heart failure hospitalization with the pacemaker-defibrillators compared to the standard defibrillator. This translates to a 7.1 percentage point absolute reduction in death and hospitalization.

The article also mentions that there was an increase in device-related complications within 30 days of implantation with the new device compared to the standard defibrillator. However, it does not provide specific numbers.

The article quotes Eric J. Topol, a cardiologist, who suggests that the reduced rate of hospitalizations may lead to a net reduction in costs from a societal standpoint. However, this is presented as a hypothetical scenario.

The article does not engage in disease-mongering but does imply that heart failure exacerbations happen rapidly with minor changes in diet, which is not supported by scientific evidence.

The article does not provide the number needed to treat (NNT), which would give readers a better perspective on the findings. The LA Times article, which is being compared to, does provide this information, stating that 14 patients need to be treated with the device to prevent one death.

The article does not adequately explain the comparison between the new device and alternative treatments, such as patient training to reduce hospitalizations. It does mention that the device is in clinical trials for the targeted patient population and that a similar device is already on the market.

The article does not provide an estimate of how many people have these devices implanted each year but mentions that multiple companies are pursuing similar devices and that one is already on the market.

Overall, the article provides more data and a better evaluation of the evidence compared to the LA Times article. However, it could have done a better job in identifying conflicts of interest among the sources quoted.

### Explanation:
",true,"This piece asked more tough questions than the story in the LA Times. It also provided readers with more of the hard data than the other story. It broke down a complicated topic and allowed readers to view the evidence from multiple vantage points. Ultimately, though, like the Times piece, it did not take the extra step of giving readers and health policymakers the information they need to assess whether this industry-funded study is an important discovery. Will this truly save millions of lives? Or is it a baby step that is, as this story mentions, more of a “boost for the heart-rhythm device business, whose sales have flattened in recent years”? Those questions are raised but not adequately addressed. Defibrillators are a significant investment, and their success as a clinical intervention depends in part on whether their widespread use will be funded. Both stories discuss the broad scope of the problem — 22 million people with heart failure worldwide — and they raise the issue of the devices’ costs. Stories like this also need to provide readers the context of how much additional benefit individuals and society as a whole would reap from increased use of these expensive devices.

746,"### Context: A team of researchers at Stanford University has developed a blood test that can help identify individuals who are likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. The test measures levels of a protein called p-tau217, which has been found to be elevated in individuals with Alzheimer's. The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, involved analyzing blood samples from over 1,400 participants, including individuals with Alzheimer's, individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases, and healthy individuals. The researchers found that the blood test accurately identified individuals with Alzheimer's disease with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 96%.

The article acknowledges that the costs associated with the test are difficult to predict since it is not commercially available and not widely accessible in research labs. It also raises concerns about the potential downstream costs of testing everyone who experiences memory loss or cognitive decline, as well as the costs of current ineffective drug treatments for Alzheimer's.

The benefits of early identification of Alzheimer's disease are not clearly addressed in the article. While one expert mentioned the value of knowing what lies ahead and being able to speak for oneself, it is unclear what individuals would do with advance knowledge of their Alzheimer's diagnosis. The article fails to discuss the burden of such knowledge for patients and their families, including potential insurance ramifications and the possibility of false positive results.

The limitations of the study are not adequately discussed in the article. The case-control patient selection used in the study may overestimate test accuracy, and the article does not comment on the fact that the publication in Nature Medicine was a letter rather than an original research article. The peer-review process for the letter is also not addressed.

The article provides objective data on annual mortality rates and overall prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, but it does not mention current approaches to diagnosis or other possible diagnoses that need to be eliminated. It does mention other tests being explored for detecting Alzheimer's, but it does not provide details on these tests.

Overall, the article accurately portrays the novelty of the blood test but lacks discussion on potential costs, benefits, limitations, and the peer-review process.
Claim: Stanford team finds blood test to help identify Alzheimer’s disease
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This was a story about a method described in a recently published letter to the journal Nature Medicine for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. While providing some details of the results outlined in the letter, the story failed to provide context to help readers understand the risks and benefits that might be associated with the kind of test described. The story failed to mention that if the test were to be demonstrated to have utility for early identification of Alzheimer’s disease, its initial greatest benefit would probably come from identifying individuals who might then participate in clinical trials to develop treatments for improved management of the condition. The story did a good job in:   providing actual numbers (e.g., test was positive for Alzheimer’s disease in 38 out of 42 patients….) and % accuracy rate  using a lot of cautionary phrases (e.g., ""preliminary studies"") and has specific caution that will be at least 2 years before available (after further testing) and ""…all technologies a long way from being available in clinics"". However, the story doesn’t give much discussion about the specific limitations of this study. For example, this case-control type of patient selection almost always overestimates test accuracy. So it’s likely to perform worse in real world populations. The story also didn’t comment on the fact that the publication in the journal Nature Medicine was actually a letter – which is curious and almost demands comment. Although methods are published, why was it not published as an original article about original research? As a letter, was it peer-reviewed? The same as original articles?

747,"### Context: The article discusses the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's decision to reverse an Obama-era ruling on the health risks of chlorpyrifos, a chemical used as an insecticide. The Trump administration claims that their decision was based on unclear science rather than a $1 million payment from Dow Chemical.

The article explains that legal action initiated by the Pesticide Action Network North America (PANNA) and Natural Resources Defense Council led to a review of human health risk assessments for chlorpyrifos in 2011 and 2014. The review found that human exposure to the chemical was not safe at levels allowed under current law. In response, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a rule to revoke all tolerances of chlorpyrifos in 2015 and issued a final revised risk assessment in 2016, which concluded that humans are exposed to harmful levels of the chemical in food and drinking water.

However, the Trump administration denied PANNA's petition to revoke all tolerances and registrations of chlorpyrifos in March 2017. The EPA stated that there wasn't clear evidence to prove that chlorpyrifos exposure led to neurodevelopmental effects in children. The EPA claimed that further evaluation of the science was needed to achieve greater certainty on the issue.

The article mentions that PANNA appealed the EPA's decision to the Ninth Circuit, but the appeal was denied. The controversy surrounding the Trump administration's action on chlorpyrifos led to criticism, with some accusing the administration of allowing its use due to a $1 million payment from Dow Chemical.

The article also highlights the public debate and attention that chlorpyrifos received following the Trump administration's decision. The New York Times published a report on the issue, and talk show host Chelsea Handler tweeted about it, claiming that chlorpyrifos causes irreversible brain damage and that Dow Chemical gave Trump $1 million.

In summary, the article discusses the Trump administration's reversal of an Obama-era ruling on chlorpyrifos and the controversy surrounding the decision. It mentions the legal action taken by PANNA and the EPA's risk assessments, as well as the criticism and public debate that followed the decision. The article also addresses the claim that Dow Chemical paid Trump $1 million, with the Trump administration attributing their decision to unclear science rather than financial influence.

748,"### Context: A study on the use of calcium supplements by women to improve bone health has shown limited benefits, according to an article. The study, conducted as part of the Women's Health Initiative, compared women taking calcium and vitamin D supplements to those taking placebo pills. The results showed a 12% reduction in hip fracture rates for those taking the supplements regularly, compared to a 29% reduction for those who took them consistently. However, the article failed to mention that the overall reduction rate was 12%, and only highlighted the 21% reduction for women over 60. The article also did not provide any estimate of the absolute risk or benefit of the supplements, and did not mention that calcium and vitamin D supplementation increased the risk of kidney stones.

The experts quoted in the article acknowledged that the trial did not provide a strong endorsement for the use of these supplements to reduce fracture rates. However, they presented a more positive view of the supplements than the study suggested. The article did not mention that the study was a randomized clinical trial, and did not discuss other approaches to bone loss, such as weight-bearing exercise or prescription medications.

The article did not provide any information on the cost of calcium and vitamin D supplements, and did not provide the context of how often hip fractures occur. The benefits of the supplements were presented as a percentage reduction in hip fracture rates, without considering the frequency of these fractures.

Overall, the article failed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the study and its findings. It did not mention important details such as the increased risk of kidney stones associated with the supplements, and did not discuss alternative approaches to bone health. The article also did not provide a balanced view of the study's results, focusing on the more positive aspects while neglecting to mention the overall reduction rate.
Claim: Study Shows Limited Benefits From Calcium
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This piece reports on the outcomes from the Women’s Health Initiative about the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D to prevent hip fracture. Although the results showed that the level of calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce hip fracture, they did find that this level of supplementation did increase the risk of kidney stones. There were several interesting points raised in the study that were not reported on in this story. This first is that the methods used to encourage supplement use was only adequate to get a subset of the women studied to take the supplements. The results also point out the discrepancy between the common measure of ‘bone health’ (bone density) and the outcome of importance (fracture rate). Lastly, the study also showed that women who fell were significantly more likely to have a hip fracture than those who never fell. This raises the question of whether an intervention to reduce the likelyhood of falls would be useful for reducing risk of hip fracture. The overall tone of the article is suggestive that women beyond menopause should still take these supplements, though this is not consistent with the results of the study.",Study Shows Limited Benefits From Calcium,"This story reported on a recent study that found that calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not provide a strong enough benefit to recommend their use for the prevention of hip fractures.

749,"### Context: The California Senate has passed a measure that would give state public health officials the authority to decide which children can skip vaccinations before attending school. The proposal comes as the nation struggles with the highest number of measles cases in decades and as state efforts to strengthen vaccine requirements face opposition. Democratic Senator Richard Pan of Sacramento, who proposed the measure, argues that it is necessary because some doctors have been selling medical immunization exemptions since California ended non-medical exemptions in 2016. Under the plan, doctors would have to certify that they examined the patient and then send the state health department the reason they are recommending the exemption. State and county health officials would also have the power to revoke exemptions if they are found to be fraudulent or do not meet federal immunization standards. The measure passed on a party-line 24-10 vote, with no Republican support. Some opponents argue that the proposal infringes on personal liberties and that the issue should be between parents and doctors, not involving the government. However, supporters argue that the measure is necessary to keep the community safe and that exemptions would still be allowed for less than 1 percent of students who have severe allergic reactions or impaired immunity. The measure will now move to the Assembly for consideration.

751,"### Context: The article debunks the claim that drinking untreated spring water, marketed as ""raw water,"" provides health benefits because it is ""probiotic."" The author focuses on the arguments made by Live Water, a company that sells raw water, to illustrate the flaws in this claim.

The author explains that Live Water claims its water is beneficial because it contains bacteria that would have been removed during the sterilization process. However, the author argues that legitimate probiotics must meet specific criteria to be considered viable, including being able to survive the stomach's environmental conditions and consume material present in the stomach. Without knowing the specific bacteria present in raw water, claims of its probiotic nature are baseless.

The author also examines the bacteria found in Live Water and concludes that they do not provide any human health benefits. The bacterial flora of Live Water belong to two genera, Pseudomonas and Acidovorax, which are found in soil and not known to be beneficial to humans. These bacteria consume dangerous organics such as solvents and dyes, not nutrients. The author states that there is no evidence to support the claim that these bacteria play a role in assimilating nutrients.

Furthermore, the author addresses Live Water's claim that certain beneficial bacteria can transform harmful bacteria. The author points out that Live Water provides no evidence of bacteriophages, which are viruses used in phage therapy to kill harmful bacteria. The inclusion of phage therapy on Live Water's website is irrelevant and suggests confusion between bacteria and bacteriophages.

Lastly, the author discusses a scientific study cited by Live Water to support the claim that raw spring water has healing abilities. The study actually focuses on the healing properties of soaking in a specific spring in Italy, not drinking spring water. The author concludes that this study, like many other statements made by Live Water, is irrelevant to the issue at hand.

In summary, the article debunks the claim that raw water is beneficial because it is probiotic. The author argues that the specific bacteria present in raw water are unknown, and the bacteria found in Live Water do not provide any human health benefits. The author also addresses Live Water's claims about transforming harmful bacteria and healing abilities, finding them unsupported and irrelevant.

752,"### Context: Japan is facing criticism for its cautious approach to testing for the coronavirus. As of Wednesday evening, Japan had 175 domestic cases of infection, separate from the cases from the cruise liner and returnees from Wuhan. The most affected area in Japan is the northern island of Hokkaido, which has reported 38 cases and another death. The country's total fatalities now stand at seven, including four from the cruise liner. 

Government guidelines in Japan state that people should call designated hotlines for consultation on whether they should get tested if they have cold-like symptoms, a fever of 37.5 Celsius, extreme tiredness, or breathing problems for four days or more. The guidelines also state that the elderly, pregnant women, or those with certain medical conditions should make the call if they have such symptoms for two or more days. The goal of testing is to prioritize those with symptoms, especially the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions who are at risk of becoming seriously ill.

South Korea, on the other hand, advises people to get tested if they have a fever or respiratory problems. The Japan Medical Association has announced that it will investigate reports of people being turned away from local health centers for tests due to manpower shortages.

Some experts argue that Japan should test more people sooner to prevent deaths. They believe that testing should be done early and treatment should be provided early, rather than waiting until people have pneumonia to confirm the virus. However, other experts agree with the government's cautious approach, stating that testing everyone with light symptoms would overwhelm the medical system.

In response to criticism, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato stated that 6,300 tests were conducted from February 18 to 24, with the capacity to conduct up to 3,800 tests daily. However, opposition party leader Yukio Edano argued that many people with ongoing fevers are unable to get tested, suggesting that the country's resources are not being fully mobilized.

Overall, Japan is defending its cautious approach to testing for the coronavirus, prioritizing those with symptoms, especially the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions. However, there are concerns that the current testing capacity may not be sufficient, leading to criticism from experts and opposition party leaders.
Claim: Japan defends cautious approach on coronavirus testing amid concerns.

753,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by the Teamsters that a proposed three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia would result in the loss of 2,000 jobs in the beverage industry. The Teamsters argue that higher prices due to the tax would lead to decreased sales and ultimately cause the soda bottling and delivery industry in Philadelphia to collapse. However, the article points out that the estimate of 2,000 job losses is higher than any previous estimate and is considered unrealistic by economists and studies.

The American Beverage Association, which opposes the tax, did not provide an estimate of job loss. The Teamsters did not respond to requests for more information, but their spokesman stated that they stand to lose as many as 2,000 regional jobs in the beverage industry. However, it is unclear what is meant by ""regional.""

Economists and studies suggest that the estimate of 2,000 job losses is an overshoot. They argue that people will not stop buying bottled drinks but may switch to bottled water or smaller-sized bottles, which would still require bottling and delivery in the city. A 2014 study funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Healthy Eating Research program found that a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (equivalent to about a two-cents-per-ounce tax) would result in small job gains. Another study from Mexico found that after the country implemented a soda tax, overall sales initially increased due to higher amounts of bottled water being purchased, but then fell back to pre-tax levels after a year.

The article concludes that without statistical data from a place that has implemented a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax, it is nearly impossible to accurately predict job loss. The estimate of 2,000 job losses is considered unlikely, and it is noted that previous estimates for job loss due to soda taxes have been much lower. Overall, the article suggests that while it is possible for some job loss to occur, the claim of 2,000 job losses is not supported by evidence and is considered an exaggeration.

754,"### Context: China is using cutting-edge technology, such as cloning and genetic modification, to address its food security problems and prepare for its growing population. With a projected population of 1.44 billion by 2030, China is seeking ways to provide better quality food. Researchers at the Beijing Genomics Institute are cloning pigs by removing DNA from skin cells of a prized boar and transferring them into pig egg cells. The resulting embryos are then implanted into surrogate sows. This technology allows China to import a small number of pigs and mass produce them domestically. International experts believe that China can play a leading role in promoting the acceptance of cloned animals and genetically modified (GM) produce. China's large population and food security issues make it an ideal candidate to revolutionize regulation and overcome the resistance to GM and cloned products in the West. China's limited arable land and water resources pose challenges for its agriculture sector. The country needs to feed 22% of the world's population with only 7% of the world's arable land. Additionally, a quarter of China's water is so polluted that it is unfit for industrial use. To address these challenges, researchers are working on identifying gene segments in rice that can increase yields and improve root systems. They hope to produce more rice using less land and water. China's per person consumption of meat is 70 kg per year, with pork accounting for 54% of that. As incomes rise, meat consumption is expected to increase, and the government wants to secure its food supply and reduce reliance on meat imports. However, China's food security problems are not unique, as the global population is projected to reach 9.1 billion by 2050. Leading economist Jeffrey Sachs emphasizes the need for serious preparations to feed the growing population. Genetic modification technology can help address these challenges, but its consequences on human health and the environment must be closely monitored. While the United States is a world leader in producing GM crops and has approved the sale of food from clones and their offspring, Europe has resistance to GM and cloned products. In China, the State Food and Drug Administration will need to approve products derived from cloned pigs and any transgenic produce before they can be sold on the market. Safety assessments are needed for transgenic products, as they have potential risks. Overall, China is using technology to improve its food security and prepare for its growing population, but careful evaluation and regulation are necessary to ensure the safety of these products.

755,"### Context: The claim that Russian president Vladimir Putin criticized Western countries for using GMOs and vaccines that slow evolution is not supported by credible sources. The statement attributed to Putin was found on dubious websites that promote anti-vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories. These websites did not provide any source for the alleged Putin statement or the original report it was supposedly taken from. The earliest instance of this claim was published on a website known for spreading anti-science views. The article appears to be pro-Russian propaganda aimed at appealing to Americans who hold anti-scientific views about vaccines and foods. It also falsely claims that Russia is a major supporter of organic farming.

While Russia has given away land in its far eastern region, it was not specifically for organic farming. The land giveaway was intended to spur development in the region, and recipients had to prove they had done something with the land after five years, primarily through agricultural means. The goal was to rejuvenate a region that had lost a significant population since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

There is no evidence to suggest that Putin holds an anti-vaccine stance. In fact, in early 2016, the Russian government was boasting about their scientists developing vaccines for the Zika and Ebola viruses.

In conclusion, the claim that Putin criticized Western countries for using GMOs and vaccines that slow evolution is based on unreliable sources and appears to be part of a propaganda effort.

756,"### Context: The claim that marijuana laced with fentanyl can be detected by its smell is not supported by evidence. There have been no documented instances of fentanyl-contaminated marijuana, and searches of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's archives did not return any results for such incidents. The claim that fentanyl-laced weed smells like popcorn is based on anecdotal reports and rumors, and most information about fentanyl indicates that it is primarily odorless or faintly powder-scented. The article also explains that cross-contamination of fentanyl has been reported in cocaine, but this does not logically carry over to the supply chains of illegal marijuana. Accidental cross-contamination is more likely to occur during the cutting and packaging process of other drugs. The spread of misinformation about fentanyl-laced marijuana can be dangerous as it may give recreational drug users a false sense of security in detecting contamination.
Claim: Marijuana laced with fentanyl is a problem, and you can detect it if ""weed smells like popcorn.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,Does Fentanyl-Laced Marijuana Smell Like Popcorn?,"Marijuana laced with fentanyl is a problem, and you can detect it if ""weed smells like popcorn.","What's true: Fentanyl has been detected in cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. What's false: There is no evidence that marijuana is laced with fentanyl, and fentanyl is odorless."
757,"### Context: China has announced new measures to ban smoking at indoor public places in an effort to reduce the country's high smoking rates. The new regulations require businesses to display prominent no-smoking signs, prohibit vending machines from selling cigarettes, and ensure that designated outdoor smoking zones do not disrupt pedestrian traffic. The Ministry of Health also urges businesses to educate customers about the health hazards of smoking and for workers to discourage smokers from lighting up.

However, the article notes that the ministry did not specify any penalties for non-compliance, suggesting that the ban may not be strictly enforced. China has previously implemented half-hearted campaigns to curb smoking in some cities, but these efforts have largely been ineffective. Despite previous pledges to restrict smoking in public venues, such as government offices and public transport, these places continue to be filled with smoke and non-smoking signs are often ignored.

The habit of smoking is deeply ingrained in Chinese society, with over 300 million smokers in the country. Chinese cigarettes are among the cheapest in the world and are considered an important part of socializing. Even among Chinese doctors, more than half are smokers. While reducing smoking rates could lower smoking-related health costs, it would also impact government revenue, as the tobacco industry contributes a significant portion of tax revenues.

The article highlights the limited deterrent of fines for smoking in certain public places, such as a 50 yuan ($7.625) fine in Guangzhou. This fine is seen as insufficient in deterring smokers, particularly in one of China's wealthiest cities. Despite the high number of smoking-related deaths in China, the government has struggled to effectively address the issue.

In conclusion, China's new ban on smoking at indoor public places aims to tackle the country's high smoking rates. However, the lack of specific penalties and previous ineffective campaigns raise doubts about the strict enforcement of the ban. The deeply entrenched smoking culture, cheap cigarettes, and the financial impact on government revenue pose challenges to reducing smoking rates in China.
Claim: China to ban smoking at indoor public places.

758,"### Context: The Taal volcano in the Philippines continues to show signs of restiveness, with new fissures in the ground and spewing fountains of red-hot lava 800 meters into the sky. The eruption has led to the suspension of government work, closure of schools, and the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights, affecting tens of thousands of passengers. The alert level for the volcano is currently at 4, indicating a hazardous eruption is possible in hours to days. More than 350 volcanic earthquakes have been recorded near Taal since the eruption began on Sunday. Over 38,000 people have been relocated to evacuation centers, and the United Nations is providing support to authorities, including face masks. The eruption has caused heavy ash fall in nearby villages, and there are concerns about pyroclastic flows, which are super-heated materials that can travel at great speed and incinerate anything in their path. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has warned residents not to return to high-risk villages based on the perception that the eruption is easing. President Rodrigo Duterte has visited the affected areas and promised government assistance for cleanup and reconstruction once the eruption ends. The Taal volcano is located in a ""permanent danger zone"" and is the second-most restive of about two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines. The country lies along the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" where seismic activity is common. The last disastrous eruption of Taal in 1965 killed hundreds of people, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, another volcano in the Philippines, caused significant damage and loss of life.

The blast resulted in the loss of his left arm, three fingers from his other hand, blindness in one eye, a fractured jaw, a shattered skull, and severe burns to his head. Sgt. Ziegel spent months in a coma and underwent over 50 operations during his two-year recovery at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas.

The article describes Sgt. Ziegel's relationship with his high school sweetheart, Renée Kline, who stood by him throughout his recovery. They got engaged before his second tour in Iraq and got married in 2006. A photograph taken on their wedding day, which showed Sgt. Ziegel's disfigured face, won an award in the World Press Photo contest. The photograph sparked questions and discussions on social media about the bride's expression and the authenticity of the image.

The photographer, Nina Berman, explained that the photograph was taken at a commercial portrait studio before the couple's wedding. Berman wanted to capture the impact of the war on young people's lives and highlight the reality of the conflict. The article also mentions that difficulties in their marriage led to their divorce in 2008.

Despite their divorce, Sgt. Ziegel and Renée maintained a warm and affectionate relationship. Sgt. Ziegel passed away in 2012 after falling on ice. His girlfriend at the time, Angela Cochran, described him as an open book who was willing to share his experiences and scars.

In summary, the article tells the story of Marine Sgt. Ty Ziegel, who suffered severe injuries in a suicide bombing in Iraq. It highlights his relationship with Renée Kline, their marriage, and the iconic photograph taken on their wedding day. The article also mentions the challenges in their marriage and Sgt.

760,"### Context: The article discusses a viral video that purportedly shows a man demonstrating an invisibility cloak. The video gained popularity after being shared on Facebook and was originally posted on the Chinese social media site Weibo by an internet user claiming to be the Deputy Director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in China. However, the video does not appear on the official government website and the search for ""quantum cloak"" and ""quantum stealth material"" yielded no results on the Criminal Investigation Bureau's website. The video was actually posted on YouTube a day before the supposed Deputy Director's post.

The article points out that the video contains clues that suggest it is the result of video editing. For example, at one point in the video, the presenter accidentally touches a plant with his leg, creating visuals that conflict with how a real invisibility cloak would work. The article suggests that the video was likely made using a blue or green cloth and computer software such as After Effect to create the illusion of an invisibility cloak. The producer of a video production company also came to a similar conclusion, explaining that the video was likely shot against a blue background while the person held a blue cloth, and then the blue areas were replaced with other footage using software.

The article also mentions that there are dozens of similar amateur videos on YouTube that use similar editing techniques, although they may not be as convincing as the viral invisibility cloak video.

In summary, the article discusses a viral video that claims to show a demonstration of an invisibility cloak. However, it points out that the video is likely the result of video editing and provides evidence to support this claim.

762,"### Context: The police union in Hollywood has launched a campaign to oust Chief Frank Fernandez, accusing him of being responsible for the high crime rate in the city. The union has floated a banner from an airplane and posted a billboard to highlight their message. The article investigates whether the claim that Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013 is accurate and if Chief Fernandez can be blamed for it. The article provides some background information on the feuds between city officials and police union leaders in Hollywood. It mentions that the city declared financial urgency in 2011 and cut officers' pay, which led to protests from the union and officer turnover. Chief Fernandez became the city's assistant city manager overseeing public safety in 2012 and chief in 2013. The article also mentions some scandals that have occurred in Hollywood in recent years, including officers convicted in a drug-selling scheme and officers involved in a cover-up of a crash. The article states that Chief Fernandez has had some success in improving the police department, including increasing recruiting and making physical improvements to the police station. However, the police union disputes an audit that found problems with the agency. The article then discusses the homicide statistics in Hollywood. The police union claims that Hollywood had the highest number of homicides in Broward County in 2013, and the article confirms that Hollywood had 16 homicides that year. The article also provides statistics from other cities in Broward County, showing that no other city had a higher number of homicides than Hollywood. However, criminologists interviewed for the article caution against drawing conclusions from one year of data and blame the chief for the number of murders. They argue that there are many factors that influence the number of murders in a city, and the police chief cannot be solely blamed. The article concludes that while the number of homicides in Hollywood is accurate, the police union cherry-picked crime statistics to put the city in the worst light. It also notes that overall crime decreased in Hollywood in 2013.

The creator of the sign misspelled both ""Pennsylvania"" and ""people"" as ""Pennsylvania"" and ""peaple."" The image was captured by Miguel Marquez, a CNN reporter, and was shared on his Twitter account. The article states that attempts were made to contact Marquez for more information about the image, but no response has been received yet. The image was part of a larger trend on social media, where discourse about protests against COVID-19 interventions and the content of anti-lockdown protest signs were widely shared.

764,"### Context: The belief that poinsettias are toxic is widespread, but according to various government agencies, health centers, veterinary groups, and plant and flower organizations, poinsettias are not toxic and do not pose a health threat to children or pets. The belief in poinsettia poison dates back to 1919 when a child allegedly died from ingesting poinsettia leaves, but there was never any proof to support this claim. The American Society of Florists conducted tests on rats and found no toxicity or side effects, even with large doses of poinsettia plant parts. POISENDEX, a source of poison information for poison control centers, states that a 50-pound child would have to eat over a pound of poinsettia leaves to exceed the doses used in the tests. The ASPCA Animal Poison Center also considers poinsettias to have low toxicity risk and does not recommend decontaminating animals that may have ingested them. The American Veterinary Medicine Association of America (AVMA) does not include poinsettias on its list of plants that are a threat to animals. Despite the lack of evidence of toxicity, many concerned parents and pet owners visit hospitals each year due to exposure to poinsettias. However, a study conducted by Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University found no significant toxicity in nearly 23,000 poinsettia exposures reported to poison control centers nationwide.

765,"### Context: The claim that a Harvard study proved that ""unvaccinated children pose no risk"" to other kids is false. The referenced study was actually an ""open letter"" written by Tetyana Obukhanych and published on an anti-vaccine website. Obukhanych argues that laws requiring mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren are misguided because most vaccines do not prevent the transmission of disease. However, her arguments are unsupported by science.

Obukhanych's claims about tetanus, hepatitis B, Hib, diphtheria, and the acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine are all flawed. While tetanus is a non-communicable disease, the tetanus vaccine is safe and prevents severe illness and death. Hepatitis B can be transmitted through various means, including mother-to-infant transmission and cuts, and vaccinating children significantly impacts the safety of public spaces. The Hib vaccine has been highly successful in reducing infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B bacteria. The diphtheria vaccine prevents colonization of the bacteria and reduces the chances of transmission. The aP vaccine may not prevent the transmission of Bordetella pertussis, but it does prevent severe pertussis and maintaining high vaccination levels is crucial. The inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has successfully blocked transmission of wild poliovirus in many countries, including Scandinavia.

Tetyana Obukhanych, the author of the open letter, has a PhD in Epidemiology from The Rockefeller University and has worked with institutions like Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine. However, she is associated with Physicians for Informed Consent, described as a ""radical anti-vaccine"" group, and has published a self-published e-book promoting vaccine skepticism.

In conclusion, the claim that a Harvard study proved that ""unvaccinated children pose no risk"" is misleading and false. The open letter by Tetyana Obukhanych, which the claim refers to, contains flawed arguments unsupported by scientific evidence. Vaccines are crucial for preventing the spread of diseases and ensuring public safety.

766,"### Context: The FDA has approved expanded indications for the drug Ilaris to treat three rare diseases: tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome/mevalonate kinase deficiency (HIDS/MKD), and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The article criticizes the FDA's news release for not providing information on the cost of the treatment or whether it is covered by insurance. It suggests that the drug may be expensive since it is administered at a hospital or clinic rather than a typical pharmacy. The benefits of the treatment are described as ""may help improve their quality of life,"" which the article deems inadequate. The release also lacks details on the clinical studies and data used to approve Ilaris for these new indications. The information on side effects is contradictory, with one paragraph mentioning minor reactions and susceptibility to colds, while the next lists serious side effects. The article argues that the release missed an opportunity to provide more informative details. It also criticizes the lack of information on the prevalence and impact of the diseases being treated and the current treatment options available to patients. The article questions the novelty of the drug, as it claims to be the first treatment for TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, but does not provide evidence to support this claim. Overall, the article finds fault with the FDA's news release for not providing enough information on cost, benefits, clinical studies, side effects, prevalence, and current treatment options.

",mixture,"This news release issued by the U.S. FDA extends indications for a drug called Ilaris (canakinumab). The new indications are Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). TRAPS and HIDS/MKD are both rare but serious autoimmune diseases for which there are currently no approved therapies. Unfortunately, lacking any information about the quality of the evidence, cost or benefits, this release is notably lacking in key details that any person suffering from these conditions would need to make an informed decision about the treatment. If there are additional useful indications for Ilaris (canakinumab), in this case to treat Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) and Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD), then this could be a good thing for patients suffering from these conditions. Unfortunately, we don’t learn from this news release what is currently used to treat patients suffering these conditions, or anything else about these rare-sounding conditions.

The release doesn’t give any information on the cost of the drug, which is a major omission. The release also doesn’t give any details on the clinical studies that led to the drug’s approval. And the release is contradictory in its description of side effects. The release would have been stronger if it had provided more details on the benefits of the drug, and if it had given more information on the prevalence of the diseases and the current treatment options. The release also would have been stronger if it had made it clear that the drug is not new. The release claims that the drug is the first treatment for two of the three diseases, but that’s not true.

767,"### Context: The article discusses a Facebook post in which a woman claims to have encountered potential kidnappers at a Target store in Houston. According to the post, two women stood too close to the author and began initiating conversation about her children, making her uncomfortable. The author reacted by using her shopping cart to create a barrier between the women and her children. The younger woman then made a comment about the author's daughter needing to talk to strangers at some point. The author interpreted this as evidence that the women were kidnappers or human traffickers scouting her family.

The article points out that the author's claims are based on assumptions and fears, rather than actual evidence. Similar stories warning about kidnappings at large chain stores have circulated on social media, but there is no concrete evidence to support these claims. The article also mentions other instances where similar stories have spread on social media, but no actual abductions have been reported.

The article highlights that the events described in the Facebook post are inconsistent with known facts about kidnapping or sex trafficking. Abductors typically do not draw attention to themselves by directly interacting with potential victims in a suspicious and hostile manner. The article also mentions that the Target store in question was contacted, and a manager confirmed that the story was ""completely overblown.""

The article concludes by stating that there is no basis to the rumor of kidnapping scouts at the Houston Target. Police in Houston also confirmed that there were no suspicious person reports at any retail stores in the area. The author of the Facebook post was not able to be contacted for further information.

In summary, the article debunks the claim that a woman encountered kidnapping scouts at a Houston Target. The events described in the Facebook post are based on assumptions and fears, and there is no evidence to support the claim.

However, the article does not provide specific details about the extent of the blood pressure reduction. The researchers reported no adverse effects, but the small sample size of the study (only nine participants) raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The article also fails to discuss the limitations of drawing conclusions from such a small study. It mentions that approximately 60% of U.S. adults are prehypertensive or hypertensive, but does not provide a source for this estimate. Furthermore, the article does not address concerns about labeling prehypertension as a disease, which has been criticized by other journalists. The article includes a quote from one of the researchers about cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death in the United States and how watermelon can help mitigate risk factors such as obesity and arterial stiffness. However, the article does not investigate evidence related to arterial stiffness and thickness, and it only focuses on prehypertension in nine individuals. The article also fails to disclose that the researchers are supported by grants from the National Watermelon Promotional Board. Additionally, the article does not discuss any other methods or research on lowering prehypertension levels. It briefly mentions that watermelon extract is available in synthetic form in pills, but does not mention if these findings have been confirmed by other independent research teams. Finally, it is noted that parts of the article appear to be directly lifted from a Florida State news release.

771,"### Context: Former Vice President Joe Biden falsely claimed during the Democratic primary debates that President Trump ""immediately discontinued"" an aid program to Central America, implying that this is the cause of surging immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. In reality, the Obama-era aid program was reduced by about 23 percent during Trump's first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels before the aid program began. Trump has since relented on his threat to cut off the aid entirely.

During the debates, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper made misleading claims about the time frame for addressing climate change. They both referenced a 12-year deadline, which is frequently mentioned in the press and by politicians. However, many scientists have come forward to say that this is the wrong way of thinking about it. The 12-year figure is extrapolated from a 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which found that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues at the current rate. The report also concluded that to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.

Sen. Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden made misleading claims about the Republican tax law. Harris claimed that the tax benefits from the law go to the top 1%, while Biden echoed this claim. However, this won't be true until 2027 when most of the individual income tax changes expire. Before that, the benefits are spread across income levels.

Sen. Kamala Harris also made a misleading claim about the number of Americans working multiple jobs. She stated that people in America are working two and three jobs, implying that this is a result of Trump's economy. However, the percentage of American workers holding multiple jobs has remained virtually unchanged since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

During a contentious moment in the debate, Harris confronted Biden on his past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with segregationist senators. While Harris accurately noted that Biden worked with these senators to oppose busing, she left out the fact that it was the local school district's decision to integrate its schools. Biden opposed busing ordered by the Department of Education.

Rep. Eric Swalwell falsely claimed that he was the only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks. In reality, Biden, for example, voted for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993, which requires background checks on most gun transfers.

Overall, the second group of Democratic presidential candidates made false and misleading claims about immigration, gun control legislation, the environment, taxes, health care, and poverty during the primary debates.
Claim: President Donald Trump “immediately discontinued” an aid program to Central America.

### Explanation:
",false,The second of a two-part debate offered a new crop of spin.,President Donald Trump “immediately discontinued” an aid program to Central America. ,"A second group of Democratic presidential candidates made false and misleading claims about immigration, gun control legislation, the environment, taxes, health care and poverty during the second round of primary debates."
772,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that the primary cause of mass shootings in the United States, particularly in schools, is the disintegration of traditional morality and Christian values. The claim was made by Republican senator Ted Cruz during a Texas U.S. Senate election debate. A Twitter user, John Rehling, criticized Cruz's argument by comparing the religious affiliation and gun crime rates in Japan and Texas.

Rehling's tweet stated that Texas, which is 93% Christian, has a fatal school shooting every year, while Japan, which is 2% Christian, has never had a school shooting. The article examines the accuracy of these claims.

According to the Pew Research Center, 77% of Texans identified as Christian, with evangelical Protestants and Catholics making up the majority. Although Rehling's claim of 93% Christian in Texas is slightly exaggerated, the broader point that Texas is overwhelmingly Christian still stands.

Regarding the number of fatal school shootings in Texas, official government databases do not track this information. However, data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) and Everytown for Gun Safety indicate that between 2015 and 2018, an average of 1.75 to 2.5 fatal school shootings occurred per year in Texas. Rehling's claim of one fatal school shooting per year in Texas appears to be a conservative estimate.

In Japan, the prevalence of Christianity is much lower. According to the Pew Research Center, 1.6% of people in Japan identified as Christians in 2010. Other sources suggest even lower estimates. Rehling's claim of 2% Christian in Japan is slightly overestimated.

The article confirms that there is no record of a school shooting, fatal or otherwise, having taken place in Japan in recent memory. Japan has strict gun control laws, and the rate of gun deaths per 100,000 people is significantly lower than in the United States.

In conclusion, the article supports Rehling's broader argument that the school shooting rate in non-Christian Japan is much lower than in mostly Christian Texas. The data indicates that Texas experiences fatal school shootings every year, while Japan has never had a school shooting. Additionally, Japan has significantly lower rates of gun crime compared to the United States.
Claim: The school shooting rate in non-Christian Japan is vastly lower than that of mostly Christian Texas.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:

Ammunition must be kept in a separate locked safe.,The school shooting rate in non-Christian Japan is vastly lower than that of mostly Christian Texas.,What's true: The rate of fatal school shootings in Texas is higher than that of Japan. What's false: The rate of fatal school shootings in Texas is not 100% higher than that of Japan.
773,"### Context: According to an article from the Austin American-Statesman, Senator Kirk Watson claims that carbon monoxide is still being used to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 animal shelters around Texas. The article states that Senate Bill 360, proposed by Watson, aims to ban the use of carbon monoxide for euthanasia in animal shelters. The bill has been advanced to the House after being sent by a Senate committee. The proposal would remove the provision in state law that allows the use of compressed carbon monoxide for euthanizing dogs and cats in shelters. Instead, these animals would be euthanized using sodium pentobarbital, which is considered more humane and less costly.

The Texas Humane Legislative Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for animal welfare, compiled a list of 32 Texas animal shelters, including one in Greenville, that still use carbon monoxide for euthanasia. The list was obtained by contacting over 1,200 cities in Texas. The article also mentions that more than 30 cities, including Sherman and Terrell, have stopped using carbon monoxide euthanasia within the last five years.

The article provides a chart listing 31 cities that use carbon monoxide for euthanasia, including Beeville, Cuero, Eagle Pass, and Victoria. However, two cities, Ganado and Freer, no longer use carbon monoxide. The article also mentions that some cities have started using injection as an alternative method, such as El Campo, which planned to start using injection on a trial basis in 2013.

The article includes a statement from Shelby Bobosky, the vice president of the Texas Humane Legislative Network, who explains that the number of shelters using carbon monoxide has decreased since their initial inquiry in 2011. Bobosky states that there is a trend among shelters to stop using carbon monoxide because it is considered outdated.

The article concludes by mentioning that three cities, Odessa, Eagle Pass, and Victoria, confirmed their use of carbon monoxide for euthanasia. However, Maverick County stated that they use a rifle to euthanize animals, which goes against the current law that limits euthanasia methods to carbon monoxide or sodium pentobarbital.

In summary, the article confirms Senator Kirk Watson's claim that carbon monoxide is still being used to euthanize dogs and cats in 29 Texas animal shelters. The article also provides information about the proposed bill to ban carbon monoxide euthanasia and the efforts of the Texas Humane Legislative Network to gather data on shelters using this method.

774,"### Context: A study conducted by researchers at the National Cancer Institute has found that the cost of cancer care for America's elderly over a five-year period is $21.1 billion. The cost varies widely depending on the type of tumor, ranging from less than $20,000 for breast cancer or melanoma to over $40,000 for lymphoma, brain, or other nervous system cancers. The highest costs occur within the first 12 months of care, when expensive treatments are administered, and in the last 12 months of life, when in-hospital costs increase. The study aims to provide policymakers with a tool to prepare for the aging population in the United States.

The researchers based their estimates on data from over 700,000 cancer patients covered by Medicare and over 1.6 million people covered by Medicare who did not have cancer. These per-patient costs were applied to a five-year survival model and extrapolated to the U.S. Medicare population diagnosed with cancer in 2004. Brain and nervous system cancers were found to be the costliest for men in each phase of treatment over five years, while ovarian cancer was the most expensive overall for women. The most costly cancers overall for women in the Medicare population were lung, colorectal, and breast cancer, while for men, they were prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer.

The study did not include the cost of treating younger cancer patients, as they tend to receive more expensive and aggressive therapies. However, as newer and more expensive treatments become more widely adopted, the cost estimates for treating Medicare beneficiaries are likely to rise. The researchers also noted that the estimates reflect Medicare discounts and are reported in 2004 dollars.

The National Cancer Institute estimated that the United States spent $72.1 billion in 2004 on direct costs for cancer care. The study provides a comprehensive picture of the incidence costs of cancer in aggregate and by tumor type for the elderly in the United States.

775,"### Context: Governor Rick Scott's budget proposal includes $4.1 billion in tax and fee relief over two years. To make this figure more relatable to voters, Scott's budget team broke it down to show the impact on Florida households, stating that each household would save $540 over two years. However, upon closer examination, it is revealed that two of the three biggest tax cuts only apply to corporations, meaning that regular households would not see any direct savings from these cuts. The cuts to the corporate income tax and the unemployment compensation tax make up $2.1 billion of Scott's overall $4.1 billion impact. The article questions whether the $540-per-household figure takes into account these corporate tax cuts, but there is no clarification from Scott's office. The article then calculates that, excluding the corporate tax cuts, the average household would actually see around $267 in tax savings over two years, not $540. This amounts to an annual savings of around $134, less than half of what Scott suggested. The article concludes that Scott and his office simply divided the entire tax cut projection by the entire number of Florida households to reach their average savings figure, which is deceptive. Overall, the claim that households will save $540 over two years is rated as Barely True.
Claim: Rick Scott Says his tax and fee cuts will save households ""$540 over two years.

776,"### Context: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has proposed a plan to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices in an effort to curb rising costs. The proposal would require Medicare to bargain over the costliest drugs, including insulin, and drugmakers that refuse to negotiate could face penalties. Companies that raise prices beyond inflation would have to pay rebates to Medicare. The plan would also limit copays for seniors covered by Medicare's ""Part D"" prescription drug program to $2,000. Medicare-negotiated prices would be available to other buyers, such as employer health plans. 

President Donald Trump has expressed support for the idea of Medicare negotiations, but prefers a bipartisan Senate bill pushed by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley. Some House Republicans have dismissed Pelosi's proposal as ""socialism,"" while the industry group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America called it ""radical"" and warned that it would stifle innovation. However, health insurers and hospitals have praised the plan as a ""bold reform"" and a step towards reducing drug prices.

Pelosi's proposal would authorize Medicare to negotiate prices for up to 250 drugs with the greatest total cost to society, including pharmacy drugs under the Part D prescription benefit and Part B medications dispensed in doctors' offices. The maximum price would be determined using a blend of international prices. Drug companies that refuse to negotiate would face penalties starting at 65% of sales for the drug at issue. The plan would also require drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise prices beyond inflation.

The proposal also includes a provision to limit what seniors pay out of pocket for medications to $2,000 a year, addressing the issue of high copays for costly brand-name drugs. Currently, Medicare's pharmacy benefit has no cap on copays, leaving some seniors with bills that rival a mortgage payment.

Criticism of the pharmaceutical industry from both Trump and lawmakers of both parties appears to be having an effect on prices. The Commerce Department's inflation index for prescription drug prices has declined in seven of the past eight months, although prices for brand-name drugs are still going up, albeit at a slower pace. Pelosi's proposal aims to address these concerns and provide relief for consumers.
Claim: Pelosi offers Medicare negotiation plan to curb drug prices.

777,"### Context: U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta made controversial remarks stating that fellow Republican Todd Akin was ""partly right"" when Akin claimed that a woman's body can shut down to prevent pregnancy in cases of rape. Gingrey, an obstetrician/gynecologist, explained that stress and adrenaline can affect ovulation, but there is no evidence to support the claim that a woman's body can prevent pregnancy in cases of rape. Some doctors and organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have criticized Gingrey's comments as patronizing, condescending, and unscientific. The National Right to Life President and a Christian Life Resources director have also made similar claims in the past. However, studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s suggest that the rate of rape-related pregnancy is higher than that of pregnancy from consensual sex. The likelihood of a rape-related pregnancy is usually around 5 percent. While stress can affect fertility, it is typically chronic stress over a long period of time, not the acute trauma of rape. Overall, there is limited scientific evidence to support Gingrey's argument.

778,"### Context: Environmental law organization ClientEarth has taken legal action against the UK government over its air quality plans. ClientEarth argues that the government's plans to tackle nitrogen dioxide emissions do not go far enough and has filed papers at the High Court to seek an order to quash the plans and order new ones. Last year, the Supreme Court ordered the government to submit new air quality plans to the European Commission, but ClientEarth claims that these plans are insufficient. The European Commission has also initiated infringement proceedings against EU member nations for breaching air quality rules. Nitrogen oxides, which are produced mainly by diesel engines, reduce air quality and are associated with over 400,000 premature deaths per year, according to European Commission data. Under the EU's Air Quality Directive, member states were required to comply with nitrogen dioxide limits in 2010, with the option to extend the deadline to 2015 if they presented plans to address high levels of the gas. However, UK government data from last year showed that only five out of 43 pollution zones in Britain would comply by the end of 2015, and the remaining three zones would not comply even by 2030. The government's plans include the introduction of ""Clean Air Zones"" in areas of Birmingham, Leeds, Nottingham, Derby, and Southampton by 2020, where pollution is most severe. In these zones, old buses, taxis, coaches, and lorries would be charged to enter, but private passenger cars would not. ClientEarth argues that the government's plans fail to take strong measures to remove the most polluting diesel vehicles from town and city centers.

780,"### Context: Results from two Phase III trials have shown that Roche's drug, bitopertin, in combination with antipsychotic therapy, did not significantly reduce negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia after 24 weeks of treatment compared to a placebo. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and reduced emotional reactivity. Sandra Horning, Roche's chief medical officer, expressed disappointment in the results, stating that more effective treatments are needed for these debilitating effects of schizophrenia. The data is also a setback for Roche, as it has been increasing its investment in neuroscience in recent years to expand beyond its core cancer expertise. Other large pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck, Novartis, and AstraZeneca, have reduced their research in this area due to the difficulty in finding new drugs. The success rate for brain drugs in Phase III trials is typically lower than for other disease areas. Roche is currently conducting a third late-stage study for bitopertin, and it is also running studies in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Analysts believe that Roche's ability to succeed in new fields outside of oncology will be critical for its long-term growth. While a successful treatment for schizophrenia's negative symptoms could have generated over a billion dollars in annual sales, analysts had modest expectations for bitopertin, with current forecasts pointing to annual sales of $407 million by 2017. Roche is conducting three additional Phase III studies to investigate bitopertin for other symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. The company will wait for the data from these studies before deciding on the next steps for the drug.

781,"### Context: The claim that the governors of Michigan, New York, and Nevada have issued orders banning the prescription of hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients is inaccurate. While New York and Nevada have restricted access to the drug to prevent stockpiling, neither state has outright banned its use. In Nevada, an emergency regulation was signed to safeguard the supply of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, limiting prescriptions to 30-day supplies and prohibiting outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing the drugs for COVID-19 treatment. In New York, an executive order restricts the prescription of chloroquine, except when written for an FDA-approved indication or as part of a state-approved clinical trial for COVID-19 patients who have tested positive. The state has acquired doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for clinical trials. The FDA has also signed an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Michigan has not taken formal action to restrict access to chloroquine, but it has asked prescribers to not stockpile the drug for friends and family. The state's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs sent a letter reminding prescribers and dispensers of their obligation to adhere to standards of practice and warned against prescribing chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19. However, on March 31, Michigan requested chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the Strategic National Stockpile based on the FDA's emergency authorization for severe cases of COVID-19. The Facebook posts claiming that the governors have banned the use of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients are inaccurate.

782,"### Context: Florida Governor Charlie Crist is claiming that he has slashed government by 10 percent, or $7 billion, in a new radio advertisement for his campaign. It is true that Florida's budget has decreased by 10 percent since Crist was elected governor in 2006. However, it is questionable whether Crist can take credit for these cuts. While he did veto $459 million from the state budget in 2007, the Florida Constitution requires that state lawmakers prepare a balanced budget. The revenue generated by sales taxes, corporate taxes, other taxes and fees, and federal appropriations determines the budget. Since 2007, revenue has declined significantly due to the nationwide recession. In the 2006-2007 fiscal year, $31.7 billion was available in the general revenue fund, compared to only $21.9 billion this year. With a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget and declining revenue, Crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes. It is argued that the budget cuts were not a concerted effort by Crist and the Legislature, but rather a result of the poor economy. Crist has defended his claim by stating that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. While he did not push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases totaling $2.2 billion this year. Therefore, while it is true that the state government has shrunk by 10 percent since Crist's election, it had little to do with him and more to do with the shrinking economy. Overall, Crist's statement is considered Barely True.

On April 10, her teachers organized a special meeting with 60 fellow fifth-graders where Sophia shared her story by explaining the beads on her necklace. The beads, called Beads of Courage, were given to Sophia by healthcare professionals to mark different aspects of her treatment for leukemia. Black beads represented blood tests or shots, white beads symbolized chemotherapy, blue beads represented clinic visits, red beads meant blood transfusions, and yellow beads marked overnight stays at the hospital. Sophia also had a special bead for hair loss and a star bead for an ambulance trip. She has nearly 100 yellow beads collected over three years. 

Sophia's mother, Connie, revealed that when Sophia was in first grade and lost her hair due to chemotherapy, she was teased by older students at her previous school. Sophia never disclosed the teasing until recently. Sophia and her mom now live in Walworth, and Sophia wanted to share her experience with her new classmates. The meeting was held in the school counselor's office, and Sophia's classmates listened quietly as she explained her journey. 

Sophia was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a blood cancer that affects the immune system and the body's main blood-making area. She underwent three years of treatments and ended them on March 11, 2016. Now, Sophia goes for blood work every three months to ensure the disease does not return. She is involved in sports such as soccer and track, and she enjoys baking. Sophia also attended Camp One Step on Geneva Lake, a weeklong camp for children with cancer, which she described as the best camp ever. 

The Beads of Courage Program provides the beads to children undergoing treatment for life-threatening diseases and injuries.

784,"### Context: A German carpenter named Clemens Bimek claims to have invented a new male contraception product that allows men to control the flow of sperm by flicking a switch. The product, called Bimek SLV, is a small valve that is fitted to the spermatic duct and can be closed or opened to regulate the release of sperm cells. When the valve is closed, it obstructs the release of sperm cells during ejaculation, resulting in sterile seminal fluid. The valve can be opened again to make the person fertile. 

However, it is unclear how well the product works, how it will be received, and when it will be available to the public. The first clinical trials for the Bimek SLV are scheduled to be conducted later in the year, and it has not yet been officially approved. The device needs to undergo extensive clinical trials to determine its effects and safety before it can be modified and released to the market. Technical checks, manufacturing certification, packaging, sterilization, and other requirements are also necessary to obtain a CE mark for the product.

Some experts are skeptical about the device. Wolfgang Bühmann, spokesman for the Professional Association of German Urologists, expressed doubts about the sperm switch. He mentioned concerns about scarring of the vas deferens, which could render the switch useless as sperm could still flow through even in the closed position. Bühmann also feared that the valve could become clogged if left in the closed position for too long.

It is important to note that while the sperm switch has been invented, it has not been tested or approved by the FDA. As of January 2016, Clemens Bimek is the only person who has undergone the procedure.

785,"### Context: The article discusses how federal agencies in the United States waited until mid-March to begin placing bulk orders for essential medical supplies, such as N95 respirator masks and ventilators, needed by frontline healthcare workers. By that time, hospitals in several states were already treating thousands of infected patients without adequate equipment and were pleading for shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile. The stockpile, created over 20 years ago, is now nearly drained just as the number of patients needing critical care is surging.

The article highlights that federal officials waited to order medical supplies until stocks were running critically low, and President Trump has asserted that states should take the lead in dealing with the pandemic. This has led to state governors bidding against federal agencies and each other for scarce supplies, driving up prices.

The article also mentions that the federal government failed to use its authority under the Defense Production Act to order companies to increase production of ventilators and personal protective equipment, despite calls from state governors. It wasn't until last week that Trump finally said he would use that power to order General Motors to begin manufacturing ventilators.

The Strategic National Stockpile, which was intended to serve as a short-term ""bridge-stock,"" was not adequately prepared for the current crisis. The stockpile had about 13 million N95 respirator masks at the start of the crisis, which is only a small fraction of what hospitals need to protect their workers. The stockpile also had a limited number of ventilators, some of which were outdated.

The article mentions that much of the world's supply of N95 masks and other medical supplies is made in China, and China initially reserved these supplies for domestic use. As a result, the U.S. is now facing a shortage of these essential supplies.

In response to the shortage, federal health authorities have lowered standards and allowed the use of emergency ventilators typically used in ambulances and anesthesia gas machines. The CDC has also advised healthcare workers to use homemade masks or bandanas if they run out of proper gear.

Overall, the article highlights the delays and failures in the federal government's response to the pandemic, leading to shortages of essential medical supplies and equipment.

786,"### Context: The article discusses a new law passed in Arkansas called the Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, which has been misrepresented in various news stories. The law bans a specific abortion procedure known as ""dilation and evacuation"" or ""dismemberment abortion"" and makes it a felony for doctors to perform this procedure, except in cases where it is necessary to prevent death or physical harm to the mother. The law does not allow exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Contrary to misleading headlines, the law does not allow rapists to sue their victims seeking an abortion. It does, however, grant spouses, parents, or legal guardians the ability to sue physicians who perform the procedure for damages and obtain injunctions preventing them from performing additional such procedures. The law also does not enable a woman's relatives to halt an abortion, but rather allows them to seek an injunction preventing the abortion provider from performing further dismemberment abortions.

The law includes a provision that prevents damages from being awarded when a terminated pregnancy resulted from the criminal conduct of the plaintiff, meaning a rapist cannot sue his victim and benefit from doing so. Additionally, a woman who receives or attempts to receive a dismemberment abortion is not held liable under the law.

Critics argue that the law is unconstitutional because it bans the most common and safest method of abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. The ACLU plans to challenge the law in court, claiming that it interferes with best medical practices and imposes an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion.

Similar laws have been passed in West Virginia and Mississippi, while related bans in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma are on hold due to ongoing legal challenges.

787,"### Context: White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham has been arrested and charged with DUI in Arizona on two separate occasions. In January 2013, she pleaded guilty to a different charge, so the DUI charge was dropped and she was not convicted. However, police records show that she had a blood-alcohol content (BAC) level above the legal limit. In December 2015, Grisham pleaded guilty to DUI and completed a treatment program. In both cases, she faced fines and penalties.

In the 2013 incident, Grisham was pulled over for driving above the speed limit and showed signs of alcohol impairment. She repeatedly denied consuming alcohol but recorded a BAC above the legal limit. Blood samples later confirmed her intoxication.

In the 2015 incident, Grisham was charged with a lighted lamps violation, DUI, and DUI with a BAC over the legal limit. She pleaded guilty to DUI and paid fines. She also mentioned undergoing a ""safety class"" in June 2019.

While Grisham was arrested twice for suspicion of DUI, she reached a plea agreement in the first case, resulting in the DUI charge being dropped. However, forensic examination of her blood sample confirmed her intoxication. In the second case, she pleaded guilty and was convicted of DUI.

Overall, the claim that Grisham ""has two DUIs"" is a mixture of true and false. While she was not convicted of DUI in the first case, the forensic evidence supports her intoxication. In the second case, she pleaded guilty and was convicted of DUI.

788,"### Context: The claim that Dutch teenager and author Noa Pothoven was voluntarily euthanized is not accurate. Multiple English-language news outlets reported this story, but it was later clarified by the Levenseindekliniek, or end-of-life clinic, in the Hague that Pothoven did not die of euthanasia. The clinic stated that due to privacy rules, they could not provide any statements about her death. Pothoven actually stopped eating and drinking to put an end to her suffering. The Life-End Clinic, which deals exclusively with euthanasia, confirmed that euthanasia did not occur in Pothoven's case.

The source of Pothoven's distress was sexual assault, as she was raped when she was 11 and 14 years old. She also suffered from severe psychological disorders including depression and anorexia. Pothoven had approached the Levenseindekliniek six months prior to her death without her parents' knowledge to inquire about assisted suicide or euthanasia. However, she was told that she was too young and her brain was not fully developed, making her ineligible for such procedures.

Pothoven's traumatic journey became public when she authored a book titled ""Winning or Learning."" Her last days were spent in a hospital bed in her family's home, where she said goodbye to loved ones. She had undergone extensive interventions, including involuntary hospitalization and an induced coma for tube-feeding.

The misreporting of Pothoven's death resulted in a ""strange moral panic"" and became a platform for various cultural debates. This is not the first time that a tragedy reported in another language has led to inaccurate or exaggerated news stories in English media.

In conclusion, Noa Pothoven did not die of euthanasia as initially reported. She chose to stop eating and drinking to end her suffering. Her story highlights the importance of accurate reporting and the potential for misinformation when tragedies are sensationalized.

789,"### Context: The claim made by the owner of the Wild Boar Meat Company, Will Herring, that there is no public study on the use of the product Kaput to poison feral hogs is accurate. Herring expressed concerns about the use of warfarin, the active ingredient in Kaput, which is a rat poison and human blood thinner, and how it could potentially damage his business. Herring stated that he could not find any specific studies on Kaput in online searches and that the company that developed the product, Genesis Laboratories, did not provide a study when inquired. Richard Poché, the president of Genesis Labs, confirmed that no Kaput study has been formally published, but the company completed a study in Texas in 2015 that was submitted for consideration by the Wildlife Society Bulletin. The study is currently undergoing peer-review and has not been published yet.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires companies to provide data from studies that comply with their testing guidelines in order to register a pesticide. However, there is no mention of whether these studies must be public or conducted independently. The EPA conducted audits to ensure that companies comply with Good Laboratory Practices, which are required by the agency. The EPA registered Kaput Feral Hog Bait under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, but registration does not imply endorsement or recommendation of the product. The EPA may suspend or cancel the registration of a pesticide if necessary.

The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) limited the sale and use of Kaput to licensed individuals, and the agency provided research grants to Scimetrics, the company poised to vend Kaput. However, the TDA does not conduct state-paid studies of proposed pesticides and has limited discretion to reject or deny registrations. The TDA stated that studies on Kaput are owned by the company and would need to be obtained directly from them.

In conclusion, there is no public study available on the use of Kaput to poison feral hogs. While a study has been submitted for publication, it has not been published yet. The EPA has registered Kaput, but registration does not imply endorsement. The TDA does not conduct state-paid studies and has limited discretion in pesticide registrations.

790,"### Context: California lawmakers are pushing for the repeal of HIV criminalization laws, which currently treat intentional exposure to HIV as a felony. State Senator Scott Wiener is promoting a bill that would make it a misdemeanor instead. The proposed change aims to treat HIV like other communicable diseases under California law. Currently, individuals who know they are infected with HIV and engage in unprotected sex without informing their partner can be convicted of a felony and face significant jail time. In contrast, intentional transmission of other communicable diseases, such as hepatitis, is only considered a misdemeanor.

Wiener argues that these laws were enacted during the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic when there was widespread fear, ignorance, and misinformation surrounding the virus. He believes it is time for California to adopt a science-based approach to HIV rather than a fear-based one. The bill, known as SB239, would also repeal laws that require first-time prostitution offenders to be tested for AIDS and increase penalties for prostitution if the sex worker tests positive for AIDS in connection with a previous conviction.

Dr. Edward Machtinger, director of the Women's HIV Program at the University of California, San Francisco, supports the repeal of these laws. He explains that the original laws were based on incomplete and outdated science from the 1980s and 1990s. Transmission rates are much lower than previously believed, thanks to modern treatment options that significantly reduce the effects of the virus and the chances of transmission.

Wiener argues that the current laws discourage people from getting tested for HIV and seeking treatment. A study conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that between 1988 and 2014, at least 800 people were arrested, charged, or otherwise involved with the criminal justice system due to their HIV status. These ""HIV criminalization"" laws disproportionately affect women and people of color, according to the study.

In summary, California lawmakers are advocating for the repeal of HIV criminalization laws. The proposed bill would downgrade intentional exposure to HIV from a felony to a misdemeanor, treating it similarly to other communicable diseases. Supporters argue that the current laws are based on outdated science and deter individuals from getting tested and seeking treatment.

791,"### Context: A study led by Todd Lee of Northwestern University in Chicago has found that a drug called ipratropium, which is used to prevent bronchospasms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may increase the risk of death from heart attacks or arrhythmias. The drug, which is made by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc under the brand names Atrovent and Combivent, has largely been replaced by Pfizer Inc's Spiriva. The researchers looked at the cause of death of 145,000 veterans with newly diagnosed COPD from 1999 to 2003 and found that those who used Atrovent or Combivent were 34 percent more likely to die from a heart attack or arrhythmia compared to those who used a similar product called albuterol or those who did not take any drugs. The study suggests that ipratropium may have some systemic cardiovascular effect that increases the risk of death in COPD patients. The researchers recommend that doctors and patients be aware of this potential risk. COPD is an umbrella term for respiratory diseases including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and it is mostly caused by smoking. It is estimated that 12 million people in the United States have COPD, making it the fourth-leading cause of death. The safety of drugs for COPD patients has been overlooked, according to Lee. In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that another COPD drug called Spiriva, marketed by Pfizer Inc and Boehringer Ingelheim, may increase the risk of stroke.

792,"### Context: The claim that Theophilus Van Kannel developed the revolving door due to an aversion to holding open doors for women and other acts of chivalry is not supported by evidence. The article refutes this claim by providing information about Van Kannel's life and inventions. It states that Van Kannel was a prolific inventor who held multiple patents, including one for a storm door structure that had similar design elements to a revolving door. He founded the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company and had a successful career as an inventor. The article also mentions that Van Kannel was married and had a daughter, refuting the suggestion that his alleged misogyny was due to not having a family. 

The article further examines Van Kannel's autobiography and journal, which do not contain any evidence of neurosis or social phobias relating to women. Instead, they reveal a dedicated and hardworking individual who followed Victorian norms of chivalry and had a healthy social life. The article provides excerpts from Van Kannel's journal entries that show him courting young women and engaging in social activities without any signs of aversion or misogyny.

The article concludes that there is no evidence to support the claim that Van Kannel developed the revolving door due to an aversion to chivalry. It states that the claim originated from a tongue-in-cheek blog post that was not meant to be taken seriously. The article also mentions that attempts to contact the 99% Invisible podcast, which popularized the claim, were unsuccessful.

Overall, the article debunks the claim by presenting evidence from Van Kannel's life and writings that contradict the notion of him having an aversion to holding open doors for women and other acts of chivalry.

793,"### Context: The article discusses the photographs that circulated on social media showing painted social-distancing boxes in a Las Vegas parking lot, which were meant to be used as a temporary homeless shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people found these pictures unbelievable or heartless, considering the availability of vacant hotel rooms in the city due to the halt in tourist activities.

However, the photographs were indeed real. On March 28, the City of Las Vegas and Clark County issued a joint news release announcing the creation of a temporary homeless shelter in the parking lot of the Cashman Center. This decision was prompted by the temporary closure of an existing homeless shelter after a homeless man who had used their services tested positive for the coronavirus.

Due to the closure of Catholic Charities, the city of Las Vegas, Clark County, and other homeless providers collaborated to set up a temporary shelter on the upper parking lot of the Cashman Center. The shelter was intended to operate from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. and would accommodate homeless individuals who could walk to the site from the Homeless Courtyard. Those with fragile health or mobility issues would still be accommodated at the Courtyard.

The article also mentions that the city reserved the building spaces at Cashman Center for potential hospital overflow if needed by the community.

The creation of the temporary homeless shelter was seen as an example of the city, county, and homeless providers coming together to slow the spread of COVID-19. Ward 5 City Councilman Cedric Crear, who represents the area, expressed gratitude towards the staff and volunteers involved in making this happen during difficult times.

In summary, the photographs showing painted social-distancing boxes in a Las Vegas parking lot were real and depicted a temporary homeless shelter set up in response to the closure of an existing shelter due to a positive COVID-19 case. The shelter aimed to provide accommodation for homeless individuals during the night, with additional measures in place for those with health or mobility issues.

794,"### Context: The claim that over 30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession if the government took over healthcare is not accurate. The survey that Rep. Michele Bachmann is referring to was not conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and was not published in the highly respected, peer-reviewed medical journal. The survey was actually conducted by the Medicus Firm, a physician recruiting service, and was initially reported in January 2010 on the firm's website. The article was later reprinted in an advertising newsletter on the NEJM's Career Center website, but it was not published in the actual NEJM.

The NEJM did put up a disclaimer on their website stating that the article was not their content and did not represent their opinions. The NEJM also sent out tweets explaining that the survey was not conducted by them. However, the article prominently stated at the top that it was ""From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine"" and carried the NEJM seal, which caused confusion.

The survey conducted by the Medicus Firm was not a scientific survey, but it randomly emailed surveys to 2,250 physicians and received 1,195 responses. The relevant question asked was how the passage of health reform without a public option would affect physicians' professional/practice plans. The majority of physicians, 70 percent, responded that there would be no change. 22 percent said they would try to retire early, 8 percent said they would try to leave medical practice even if not near retirement age, and 1 percent said they would go back into practicing medicine.

While the results of the survey should not be dismissed, they have been ""over-sensationalized"" by some. The survey did not ask if physicians would actually leave the profession, but rather if they would ""try"" to leave. The Medicus Firm believes that the survey results are thought-provoking and that the healthcare reform bill exacerbates existing issues faced by physicians.

In conclusion, the survey Bachmann referred to was not conducted by or published in the NEJM. It was conducted by a physician recruiting service and was not a scientific survey. The NEJM has put up disclaimers to clarify that the article was not their content, but the confusion may have arisen from the labeling of the article as ""From the publishers of the New England Journal of Medicine."" Bachmann's claim that 30 percent of American physicians would leave the profession if the healthcare bill passed is an exaggeration, as the survey asked if physicians would ""try"" to leave or retire early, not if they would actually do so.

The new order, which extended the ban for 12 more days until the end of April 18, came after the country reported 51 new coronavirus cases and three more deaths on Monday, raising the numbers to 2,220 cases and 26 fatalities. The number of new cases was the lowest daily rise since March 20. Monday also marked two weeks - the estimated incubation period for the new coronavirus - since Bangkok shut down shopping malls to limit the spread of the virus.

796,"### Context: Former President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden for the presidency and highlighted the difference between Democrats and Republicans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Obama argued that Republicans, including the Trump administration, have been willing to cut millions off their health insurance and eliminate preexisting condition protections. This claim is supported by the fact that the Trump administration has argued in a pending Supreme Court case, Texas v. Azar, that the ACA should be struck down. The administration has also refused to provide a special open enrollment period for the ACA health exchanges during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Texas v. Azar case stems from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which removed the individual mandate penalty from the ACA. Republican states' attorneys general argue that without the penalty, the rest of the ACA should be struck down. If the ACA is eliminated, it would eliminate preexisting condition protections, subsidies for insurance on the exchanges, and the Medicaid expansion that extended coverage to millions of people.

The Trump administration has declined to support the ACA in court and has even sided with the states arguing for its elimination. The administration has not put forth a replacement plan that would maintain the ACA's protections. Trump has stated that he still wants the law ""terminated.""

The article also highlights the administration's refusal to provide a special open enrollment period for the federal health exchange during the pandemic. This means that Americans who have lost their jobs and insurance due to COVID-19 cannot easily access health insurance. While 11 states have reopened their state-run exchanges for a special sign-up period, the administration has not taken similar steps for the national marketplace.

Without the ACA, the impact of COVID-19 would be catastrophic. Many Americans would not be able to find affordable health insurance, and even with insurance, access to testing and treatment is not guaranteed. Insurance companies could charge more to cover people who have previously contracted COVID-19, and plans could revert to skimpier coverage without the ACA's regulations.

In conclusion, Obama's claim that Republicans have shown a willingness to cut millions off their health insurance and eliminate preexisting condition protections is supported by the Trump administration's actions and stance on the ACA. The potential elimination of the ACA without a replacement plan would have devastating consequences, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

797,"### Context: The article titled ""The homeliest nut just got better"" discusses a study on the health benefits of walnuts, particularly in older adults. The claim states that the article lacks important information and quantification, but overall, it is considered satisfactory.

The article mentions that the study found reductions in bad cholesterol among the walnut eaters, but it does not provide specific details on the extent of the reduction or whether it is clinically significant. It also states that neither group showed weight gain or changes in other cardiovascular markers, but does not present concrete evidence.

The article briefly mentions the potential good gut effects of walnuts but does not provide any supporting information. It does highlight that walnuts can be a fattening food and portion control is necessary. The only harm mentioned is weight gain due to the high calorie content of walnuts, and there are no expected harms for those who are not allergic to them.

The article does not provide enough details to determine the quality of the study. It raises concerns about how the researchers ensured that participants actually consumed the walnuts. Additionally, the study findings were presented at a conference and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, which should make journalists cautious.

The article is considered satisfactory in terms of disease mongering as it focuses on weight gain with age and the importance of maintaining cardiovascular health. It mentions that the walnut research was funded by the California Walnut Commission and quotes an independent nutrition expert, although she does not discuss the study.

However, the article misses an opportunity to compare walnuts with other nuts, foods, or pharmaceuticals for cardiovascular health. It also does not reference previous studies on nuts and their effects on cardiovascular health, making it unclear how this study adds to the existing body of research.

Overall, the article is considered satisfactory as it provides some information on the study but lacks important details and comparisons. It is based on a news release and includes an outside source, which slightly improves its rating.

It tested positive for a strain of rabies normally associated with bats. The department’s state public health veterinarian Dr. Leslie Tengelsen says in a prepared statement that rabies is fatal virtually 100% of the time. She says the cat was likely exposed to a rabid bat, and that’s how it became infected. Tengelsen says pet owners should vaccinate their dogs, cats, ferrets and horses against the disease.

799,"### Context: The article discusses a satirical petition that was created on Change.org in 2015, which sought to change the name of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store chain of restaurants and gift shops to ""Caucasian Barrel."" The petition claimed that the name ""Cracker Barrel"" was offensive and mocked European Americans. It suggested that white people should also have something to be offended by. The petition gained popularity on social media, with some users finding it clever and others claiming the joke as their own.

The article provides an explanation for the name ""Cracker Barrel"" from an obituary of the chain's founder, Dan Evins. It states that the name was chosen to reference old-time country stores where people played checkers atop barrels used to carry crackers and other goods. The term ""cracker"" was reclaimed by poor white people as a badge of honor and term of endearment in the early 1800s, well before the Cracker Barrel chain existed.

The creator of the satirical petition, Ryan Koch, clarified that it was meant to be a form of satirical expression and shed light on the ridiculousness of political correctness. He stated that he did not actually want Cracker Barrel to change its name and had no ill feelings towards the restaurant chain. Cracker Barrel responded to the petition, stating that they recognized individuals' right to express their opinion but had no plans to change their name.

The article concludes by mentioning that the petition gained thousands of signatures, but it seems that most people understood it as a critique of a culture that some feel has become too sensitive. It also mentions that in 2016, a website revived the rumor that ""liberals"" wanted to change the name of Cracker Barrel, but the original petition remains purely satirical.

Overall, the article highlights the satirical nature of the petition and provides context about the name ""Cracker Barrel"" and its historical connotations. It also emphasizes that the petition was not meant to be taken seriously and was intended to criticize political correctness.

800,"### Context: The article discusses the issue of mothers of babies with microcephaly being abandoned by their partners in Brazil. The claim is supported by the story of Barbosa, an 18-year-old mother who blames her baby's abnormally small head and brain damage on the Zika virus she contracted during pregnancy. She believes her ex-partner left her because of the baby's condition. The article highlights that single parenthood is common in Brazil, but doctors are concerned about the number of mothers of babies with microcephaly being abandoned. The health service is already under strain, abortion is prohibited, and the virus affects the poorest the hardest, making an absent father an additional burden on struggling mothers. 

The article also mentions that a specialized microcephaly clinic in Campina Grande provides psychological support to mothers, but only 10 out of 41 women receive adequate financial or emotional support from their partners. The psychologist at the clinic blames Brazil's macho culture and strict gender roles for the abandonment of mothers and babies with microcephaly. The article states that much remains unknown about Zika and its link to microcephaly, but Brazil has confirmed 745 cases of microcephaly since October, with most of them related to Zika infections in mothers. The country is investigating another 4,230 suspected cases.

The article includes insights from Jennifer Lewis, who runs the U.S.-based Microcephaly Foundation and has a daughter with the condition. She mentions that fathers often abandon their partners and children due to fear. The lack of support networks for fathers in Brazil is also highlighted, with the clinic in Campina Grande only offering support groups for mothers. The article suggests that the health sector should provide specific support for men to address the issue of fathers leaving.

The article concludes by sharing the story of Josemary da Silva, a mother in a small town who is raising her microcephaly baby alone after the father stopped contributing financially and rarely visits. This story further supports the claim that mothers of babies with microcephaly are often left to raise their children alone in Brazil.

801,"### Context: The article in question is from a dubious news site that claims the government injected a birth defect-inducing vaccine called Terminar into epidurals between 2010 and 2014 in order to harm Black women. The article is based on statements from a supposed government anesthesiologist named Henry Rothschild, but it does not provide any actual quotes or evidence to support these claims. The site, Fammtv.com, was contacted for more information but did not respond.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not published epidural use statistics for the years mentioned in the article, but a study from 2008 showed that 62 percent of Black women used epidurals during childbirth. The CDC is being contacted to obtain epidural usage rates between 2010 and 2014.

However, a 2014 study by the American Public Health Association (APHA) contradicts the allegations made by Fammtv. The APHA study, which tracked 13.5 million live births in the U.S. between 1999 and 2007, found that there were ""much higher occurrences"" of birth defects among American Indian/Alaska Native children, not African-Americans, compared to white children. This undermines the claim that a vaccine was being used to harm Black women's ovaries and cause birth defects.

In summary, the article is based on unsubstantiated claims from a dubious news site. The site alleges that the government injected a birth defect-inducing vaccine into epidurals between 2010 and 2014 to harm Black women, but provides no evidence or quotes to support these claims. The CDC has not published epidural use statistics for the years mentioned, and a study from 2014 contradicts the allegations by showing higher occurrences of birth defects among American Indian/Alaska Native children, not African-Americans.

Valentina's brother had previously died from the same disease, and she has undergone multiple surgeries that have caused her significant pain and suffering. Valentina's father expressed surprise at the video and explained that despite promises of improvement, her condition has worsened. A spokesperson from the hospital where Valentina is being treated confirmed her stable condition with no immediate life-threatening issues. The government spokesperson stated that they are in contact with the family to ensure Valentina receives the necessary psychological and medical treatment but ruled out euthanasia as an option due to the current law in Chile. Euthanasia is illegal in Chile, and the Catholic Church holds significant influence in the country. Chile is also one of the few countries that completely bans abortion. President Bachelet, who has introduced reforms including a bill to relax the abortion law, has not mentioned euthanasia in her agenda.

803,"### Context: A recent assessment by the Department of State Health Services in Texas has identified a cancer cluster in a polluted neighborhood in Houston. The assessment was requested by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality due to concerns from residents that polluted groundwater from the Union Pacific site had made them sick. The assessment did not determine whether the cancers were linked to chemicals beneath homes in the area, but it found that the number of lung and bronchus cancers was 36% higher than expected, esophagus cancers were almost 63% higher, and larynx cancers were 90% higher.

The assessment did not account for how long residents had lived in the area and cautioned that lifestyle and other factors could also be a cause of the higher cancer rates. However, the study found that the contaminants in the plume were linked to the specific cancers identified. For example, arsenic found in creosote, which was used in a rail yard in the area until the 1980s, is linked to lung cancer.

Union Pacific, which bought the site in 1996, stated that it is reviewing the study. The study was completed in August, but the city and residents were not notified by the state until the end of November. This lack of communication between the state and the community has been criticized by experts.

The city health department has requested additional studies from the state to determine if there is an environmental link to the cancer cluster. They also plan to conduct a door-to-door health survey and gather information about people who may have moved away before being diagnosed with cancer. The chief environmental science officer at the Houston Health Department stated that even if an environmental link is proven, it would likely be due to exposure when pollution levels were higher, as cancer takes a long time to develop.

Residents in the affected neighborhood expressed frustration and anxiety over the situation and the slow progress in addressing the issue. The city health department emphasized the need for a closer examination and further studies to determine the extent of the environmental link and to consider other health effects caused by chemicals in the plume.

804,"### Context: The article discusses the potential benefits and limitations of the artificial pancreas, a technology that combines continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps to regulate blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. The article criticizes the lack of information regarding the costs of the components and the limited insurance coverage for these devices. It also questions the validity of the reported benefits, such as reduced variability and time spent in target blood glucose range, due to the absence of information about the comparator group. The article highlights the need for an independent analysis to clarify the significance of the benefits and the potential harms associated with spending time below the target glucose range. It also points out that the study's small sample size and short duration make it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. The article suggests that the technology is still in the experimental stage and emphasizes the need for further research before it can be made available to the public. It criticizes the article for not providing a clear explanation of how the artificial pancreas works and what it consists of physically. The article also questions the lack of independent sources and the reliance on a press briefing for information. Overall, the article acknowledges the promise of the artificial pancreas but raises concerns about the lack of comprehensive information and the need for further research.
Claim: Artificial Pancreas Continues to Show Promise
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Not only does this story neglect to provide any caveats regarding research abstracts presented at conferences, it omits the number of subjects in the study. One of the most important pieces of context for this study was that it only had 12 subjects. That needed to be in the article. In general, the term ""artifical pancreas"" builds unrealistic hope for this technology for patients, and some balance and caution would’ve enriched the optimism with realism, doing a greater service to those with diabetes who are very interested in this topic. This story matters because hypoglycemia is dangerous and self-monitoring combined with use of insulin requires a patient to be an engaged and knowledgeable self-manager. The hope of this technology is that it would function more like a normal pancreas. But that’s it’s hope. Although the story provides little information about the risks and benefits observed in this small pilot study, it implies that it’s almost ready for prime-time, despite late hints at the end of the article that the technology is not there yet. The discussion of the Ritholz research on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) compliance is somewhat disconnected and only loosely germane to the artificial pancreas. Research on CGM, which is approved and in use, has clinical relevance unrelated to the investigational ""artificial pancreases,"" of which it’s a component. We can only assume this study was covered in the article because it was discussed on the teleconference call that was a source of information for the story.",Artificial Pancreas Continues to Show Promise,"The news release focuses on a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that looked at the use of an artificial pancreas to help people with type 1 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels. The release does a good job of explaining the study’s design and the benefits that were reported. However, it doesn’t address costs, which are significant, and it doesn’t address the limitations of the study, which were significant. The release also doesn’t address the fact that the study was funded by a company that makes the devices used in the study. The release would have been greatly improved had it included an independent analysis of the study’s findings. The artificial pancreas is a technology that has been in development for many years. It is a technology that has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes. However, the technology is still in the experimental stage and has not yet been approved for use by the FDA. The study discussed in this news release is part of the process of evaluating the technology and determining whether it is safe and effective."
805,"### Context: The article titled ""Doctors weigh brain-oxygen monitor"" discusses the use of a brain-oxygen monitor device during heart surgery. The article mentions that the device costs $30,000 and has a cost per use of $200. It also states that the cognitive risks associated with the device range from minor to major and could potentially impair patients' ability to work.

However, the article falls short in providing evidence regarding the potential harms associated with the device itself. It does not report the best scientific evidence available about the controversy surrounding the device. The absence of data or a clear statement about the availability or inconclusiveness of data is a major shortcoming of the article.

The article does not exaggerate the cognitive risks following heart surgery and uses an estimate of side effects from a study published in the New England Journal. It also allows those who question the validity of those statistics to make their case, considering that some surgery patients may already have cognitive issues before the surgery.

The reporter interviews two advocates of the device, one independent and one with industry ties, as well as one surgeon who is unconvinced of its value. The article briefly cites two key studies about cognitive impairment after heart surgery, which elevates the sourcing of the report to a ""satisfactory"" rating, although barely.

The article provides a thorough description of how the device functions in surgery and implicitly compares surgery with and without the oxygen monitoring device. However, it fails to mention beating-heart surgery, a method designed to eliminate the need for the heart-lung machine, which is believed to be responsible for cognitive side effects. This omission is significant.

The article does not mention whether the brain oxygen monitoring device is available at only a few surgical centers or all of them. It also does not discuss the difficulty for patients to request the device for their own surgery.

Lastly, the article mentions that the device in question is 10 years old and sometimes used. There is no evidence to suggest that the article relied solely or largely on a news release.

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This article provides a good overview of arguments for and against use of a brain-oxygen monitoring system for heart surgery. It also provides an excellent explanation of how the device works, and how it may reduce risk of cognitive damage following surgery. The biggest problem with the story is the lack of evidence and quantitative data about cognitive harm both with and without the device. While the story implies that conclusive data are not available, it should have cited the most relevant research and provided the necessary caveats. Finally, a failure to mention the option of beating-heart surgery for some patients–a technique shown to reduce risk for cognitive damage–is a significant oversight.",Doctors weigh brain-oxygen monitor,"This is a well-reported story about a device that is used in some open-heart surgeries.

806,"### Context: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee criticized President Donald Trump's support for protesters demanding an end to stay-at-home orders. Inslee argued that these orders, issued by governors to combat the spread of the coronavirus, are laws that protect people's health and lives. Legal experts agree that while these orders may not be passed by legislatures and signed by governors in the traditional way, they have the same practical effect as laws. They are issued under legal authority delegated by legislatures and would likely be deemed constitutional in court. Most states have issued stay-at-home orders or requirements for business closures, typically through executive orders, proclamations, directives, or simply orders. Inslee's stay-at-home order in Washington was enacted under the state's emergency powers law. Legal experts confirm that these orders effectively carry the force of law, even if they are not passed through the traditional legislative process. Violations of these orders can result in misdemeanor charges in some states. However, law enforcement may prioritize education and voluntary compliance over legal or regulatory action. Stay-at-home orders do raise concerns about First Amendment rights, particularly freedom of assembly. However, experts argue that fundamental rights can be limited by public health concerns. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that mandatory vaccination laws are a legitimate exercise of state power to protect public health and safety. Time, place, and manner restrictions on speech, including protests, are frequently upheld as long as they are not targeted to a particular message. Government authority to protect public health, safety, and welfare is read more expansively during emergencies. While silencing people completely would be questionable, the government may find it necessary to prevent public gatherings until they are deemed safe by health experts. In summary, while stay-at-home orders may not be passed as traditional laws, they have the same practical effect and can be enforced in similar ways. They are issued under legal authority and are likely to be deemed constitutional. These orders can limit certain First Amendment rights in order to protect public health and safety.

807,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests cortisol levels in children's hair may be an indicator of future mental health risk. However, the article points out several limitations and flaws in the study. The correlation between cortisol and traumatic events is small, with the history of traumatic events accounting for only 5 to 13% of the variance in cortisol levels. Other factors, such as sex, also have a significant impact on cortisol levels. The sample size of the study is small, with only 14 boys and 56 girls, making it insufficient to suggest the test has diagnostic or screening potential. The study also relies on questionnaires to parents to determine the history of traumatic events, which may not be reliable. The article questions the lack of an independent perspective in the story and suggests that alternatives to testing cortisol levels, such as sociological and environmental variables, may provide more insight into identifying children at risk. The availability and novelty of the hair cortisol test are not discussed in the article. Overall, the article criticizes the study for making claims beyond the data and emphasizes the need for further research to validate the hair cortisol test's accuracy and usefulness.
Claim: Cortisol levels in children's hair may reveal future mental health risk
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story reports that in an Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol. Here’s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain. So it’s a huge stretch to claim that cortisol in hair “may reveal future mental health risk” in children. We wish the story had been more cautious, especially in its headline, when discussing the implications of this very preliminary research. Childhood lays the foundation for one’s health over a lifetime, so identifying people who have risk factors for health problems early on — as with a simple hair test — is an attractive idea. This might allow for early intervention to modify risk and get people into treatment sooner, lessening the impact of disease or behavioral problems on their lives.",Cortisol levels in children's hair may reveal future mental health risk,"This story reports on a study that found that cortisol levels in children’s hair may be a marker for future mental health risk. The story does a good job of describing the study and the test itself. However, the story should have been more cautious in describing the results of the study. The correlation between cortisol and traumatic events is small. The history of traumatic events accounted for only 5 to 13% of the variance in cortisol levels. Other factors, such as sex, also had a significant impact on cortisol levels. The sample size is small (14 boys and 56 girls). This is far too small to suggest that the test has diagnostic or screening potential. The story also relies on questionnaires to parents to determine the history of traumatic events.

The tweet read, ""Do you know what's deplorable? Being impeached!"" This tweet was in response to Clinton's remarks about some of Trump's supporters being a ""basket of deplorables."" The tweet from Trump Jr. was still on his timeline as of December 2019. 

The article also mentions the impeachment of both President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. President Trump was impeached on two counts by the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019. Screenshots and quotations of Trump Jr.'s tweet to the Clintons circulated after President Trump's impeachment. 

In 1998, President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives following news of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton acknowledged his ""inappropriate"" conduct with Lewinsky in a televised address to the nation but did not admit to lying, instructing others to lie, or orchestrating a cover-up. The House Judiciary Committee recommended an impeachment inquiry, and the House adopted two articles of impeachment. However, the Senate did not have a two-thirds majority to remove Clinton from office.

Overall, the article highlights the tweet from Donald Trump Jr. in 2016, which referenced Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comment, and provides background information on the impeachment of both President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton.

809,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott that his opponent, Alex Sink, wants to cut Medicare benefits for seniors. Sink denies this claim, and PolitiFact Florida investigates the issue. Scott's campaign points to Sink's support of President Obama's health care legislation as evidence for their allegation. The article explains that the health care bill includes reforms to Medicare, such as increasing spending to improve benefits and coverage, reducing the growth in Medicare spending to operate more efficiently, and funding coverage expansions for the uninsured. The bill also includes a $250 rebate for prescription drugs purchased through Medicare Part D and reduces the growth in Medicare spending by over $500 billion over 10 years. The article also mentions changes to the Medicare Advantage program, which costs taxpayers more than the traditional Medicare plan. The health care law phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs and institutes other rules for the program. Experts say that while the adjustments to Medicare Advantage may be considered cuts, the core benefits of Medicare will not change. The extra benefits received under Medicare Advantage may be reduced, but patients will not receive fewer Medicare benefits than those in the traditional program. The article concludes that Sink, as a gubernatorial candidate, does not have the power to cut Medicare benefits since it is a federal program. Sink's support of the health care legislation does not necessarily mean she supports cuts to Medicare, as the law also increases some prescription drug benefits. Therefore, the article concludes that there is no credible case to be made that Sink supports cutting Medicare benefits, and rates Scott's statement as false.

This is the first human case of H7N9 in Fujian province this year. In addition, two people in eastern Zhejiang province, a 79-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man, have also been infected with H7N9. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported that seven more people in China have been found to be infected with H7N9 in the past week, bringing the total number of cases to around 150. The H7N9 bird flu first emerged in China last year and has infected people in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, resulting in at least 45 deaths. While there is no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission of the virus, a scientific analysis published last August suggested that the virus can at times jump between people, potentially causing a human pandemic. The WHO is still investigating the source of the human infections and has not recommended any special screening or travel restrictions.

The post suggests that parents can call the number on the back of their formula canister and explain that the virus has affected their ability to find formula, and the companies will send them a case free of charge. However, this claim is not true.

Several formula producers, including Enfamil, Gerber, Similac, and Aptamil, have released statements addressing the rumor. Enfamil tweeted that the rumor is false and stated that they are focused on ensuring equitable availability for every baby. Gerber also clarified on their website that they are not giving away free formula but are committed to supporting babies and families with dependable and affordable nutrition. Similac addressed the rumor as well, emphasizing their focus on working with local teams, retail partners, and government authorities to safeguard the availability of infant formula products for all families.

Aptamil, a formula brand in the UK, explained on its website that they are unable to send out free formula due to strict regulations. They mentioned that the World Health Organization guidelines strictly prohibit them from giving out free milk under any circumstances.

813,"### Context: The article confirms that in January 2017, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made a prediction about a surprise infectious disease outbreak during President Donald Trump's presidency. Fauci, who has been in his position for over three decades and has advised multiple presidents on global health threats, made this prediction during a forum on pandemic preparedness at Georgetown University. He emphasized that previous administrations had faced similar challenges and that it was a perpetual challenge to deal with infectious diseases.

The article also mentions that Fauci's remarks were reported by healthcare news aggregator Healio.com in January 2017. The report included commentary from other experts on infectious diseases, such as Ronald Klain, who coordinated the U.S.'s Ebola response for the Obama administration. Klain criticized Trump's response to the Zika outbreak and questioned his perspective on global health issues.

Furthermore, the article highlights that Fauci's remarks about pandemic preparedness and the recurring nature of pandemics were not unique to this particular speech. He has consistently emphasized the need for preparedness and investment in research and development for vaccines and therapeutics. Fauci has warned about the challenges of developing vaccines in response to pandemics and the importance of having a stable funding mechanism for public health emergencies.

Overall, the article confirms that Dr. Anthony Fauci did predict a serious pandemic during President Donald Trump's tenure in office in January 2017. His prediction was based on his expertise in infectious diseases and his experience advising previous administrations on global health threats.

814,"### Context: The Gun Owners of America (GOA) has criticized the health care reform bill passed by the Senate Finance Committee, claiming that it could be used to ban guns in home self-defense. The GOA speculates that the administration may target people with ""excessively dangerous"" behaviors, such as gun ownership, to control health care costs. The group accuses Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of having an ""antipathy to the Second Amendment"" and suggests that the bill could preclude reimbursement for households with loaded firearms for self-defense.

However, an analysis of the Baucus bill itself reveals no mention of guns or firearms. The bill focuses on setting federal rules for the individual and small group health insurance markets, aiming to address restrictions on pre-existing conditions and coverage limitations. While the bill does allow insurers to charge higher premiums based on behavior, such as tobacco use, there is no explicit support for the GOA's claim that gun ownership would be targeted.

The Baucus bill actually provides stronger protections for people with ""unhealthy behaviors"" in most states. Currently, states have varying rules for adjusting premiums, but the federal rules proposed in the bill would restrict when insurers could charge higher premiums. This means that gun owners would have more explicit protection under the Baucus bill than they currently have in most states.

Furthermore, there is no indication in the bill that gun ownership would be considered a behavioral factor in premium-setting. The bill only mentions medical issues, such as cholesterol levels, body mass index, smoking cessation, and weight loss, as factors that could affect premiums.

While a more behavioral approach to pricing health care may be gaining steam, there is insufficient evidence to support the GOA's claim that the Baucus bill could be used to ban guns in home self-defense. The bill itself does not contemplate gun ownership as a factor in premium-setting.
Claim: The Baucus health care bill ""could be used to ban guns in home self-defense.

815,"### Context: The Trump administration's plan to allow Americans to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada is causing concern among Canadians. John Adams, the volunteer chairman of the Best Medicines Coalition, warns that the plan is a ""clear and present danger"" to the health and well-being of Canadians who need prescription medications. He explains that the existing supply of drugs in Canada is not sufficient to meet the current needs of Canadians, let alone a sudden surge in demand from the United States. Several organizations, including Diabetes Canada, have signed a letter urging the Canadian government to protect the country's drug supply. Kimberley Hanson, executive director of Diabetes Canada, emphasizes that Canada is not structured to produce the amount of medications required for the size of the American population. Canadian health officials were surprised by the Trump administration's announcement, as they were not consulted beforehand. Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor's office states that while there is a mutual interest in fostering lower drug prices, the details of the announcement were not discussed. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau assures Canadians that Health Canada will ensure a steady and solid supply of medications, regardless of external or international pressures. The Trump administration's plan still needs regulatory approval and may face court challenges from drugmakers. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar explains that the plan is a response to the changing landscape and opportunities for safe linkage between drug supply chains. He expresses the desire to see proposals from states, distributors, and pharmacies that can help achieve the shared goal of safe prescription drugs at lower prices.

816,"### Context: The claim that ""Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country"" is supported by evidence. While there is no complete database that tallies abortions by providers, Planned Parenthood self-reports that 323,999 abortions were performed at its facilities nationwide for the year ending September 30, 2015. This represents 35 percent of the estimated 926,200 U.S. abortions for calendar year 2014. The Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion providers, confirms that Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion care in the United States. However, it is worth noting that local providers unaffiliated with a national organization collectively perform the majority of procedures. The National Right to Life Committee also states that the 35 percent figure easily makes Planned Parenthood ""the nation's largest abortion chain,"" with no evidence that any other provider comes close. Planned Parenthood operates around 660 centers across the country, with about half offering abortions. The agency's facilities see patients from all 50 states, except for North Dakota, which has no Planned Parenthood health center. While the agency does not track the numbers on other providers, it is widely recognized that there is no other national organization operating on the same scale as Planned Parenthood. Overall, the claim that Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country is supported by the evidence provided.
Claim: Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Grothman told constituents that ""Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."" The agency’s national network of clinics stands apart from other providers as the undisputed leader when it comes to providing abortion services. This is one of those truisms that is basically, well, True. (Editor's note, June 7, 2017: An earlier version of this item quoted Grothman as saying that Planned Parenthood is an outspoken advocate for ""controversial"" services such as birth control. A spokesperson for his office said on June 7, 2017 that the video, in which Grothman's voice is hard to hear at times, may have led people to that conclusion, but that Grothman does not believe birth control is a controversial service. The birth control quote had no bearing on the congressman’s statement about Planned Parenthood and its role in abortions, so the rating of True is unchanged.) ",Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country.,"Cruz said, """"Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."""" The group’s self-reported numbers back up the claim, and the Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion providers, confirms that Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion care in the United States. It’s worth noting that local providers unaffiliated with a national organization collectively perform the majority of procedures. Still, Cruz’s statement is accurate."
817,"### Context: A Facebook post claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, George Soros, and Jeffrey Epstein are connected to Moderna, Inc. and its efforts to create a coronavirus vaccine. However, these claims are unfounded. Moderna, Inc. was founded in 2010 and has no connection to Germany's IG Farben, as the post suggests. IG Farben was a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate that existed during World War II and was later divided into three separate companies. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, was never the CEO of Moderna. He graduated from Weill Cornell Medical College and has spent his career in the public sector. Fauci and Gates were not roommates at Cornell, as Gates did not attend Cornell and Fauci was already working for the NIH when Gates started at Harvard. The claim that Gates designed RFID technology and patented it is also false. The patent number cited in the post is for a different invention related to SARS. The post also falsely claims that George Soros was a Nazi and bought the assets of IG Farben to disguise the company as Moderna. Soros survived the Holocaust and was a teenager when IG Farben was split up. Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was not a primary stockholder in Moderna. He was awaiting trial for federal sex trafficking charges when he died in 2019. There is no evidence to support the claim that Epstein had any significant involvement with Moderna. Overall, the Facebook post's claims connecting Fauci, Gates, Soros, and Epstein to Moderna and its vaccine efforts are inaccurate.

818,"### Context: The article claims that a video shows Londoners chanting U.S. President Donald Trump's name in the aftermath of a terrorist attack in June 2017. The video was posted on the Red State Watcher website and was accompanied by articles with headlines such as ""Wow! Londoners chant President Trump's name instead of mayor"" and ""Sadiq Khan May Be In Trouble - Look What Londoners Are Doing!"" The articles suggest that Londoners were fed up with Mayor Sadiq Khan's soft stance on terrorism and instead chanted Trump's name.

However, the video and articles were part of a high-profile dispute between Khan and Trump. Trump had misrepresented comments made by Khan, claiming that the mayor had told the people of London there was ""no reason to be alarmed"" at the attack. In reality, Khan was referring to increased police patrols and reassuring residents not to be unduly concerned. Khan's spokesperson called Trump's tweet ""ill-informed"" and accused him of taking Khan's comments out of context. Trump then doubled down on his attack, calling Khan's explanation a ""pathetic excuse.""

Contrary to what the Red State Watcher articles implied, the video had nothing to do with the dispute or the June 2017 terrorist attack. The video was actually shot in March 2017 by Paul Golding, leader of the right-wing extremist group Britain First. It shows a small group of far-right activists engaged in a counter-protest at an anti-racism rally in London. Some of the activists chanted in favor of Trump, but the video does not show a spontaneous assembly of Londoners favoring Trump over Khan in response to the terrorist attack.

In summary, the video and articles claiming that Londoners were chanting Trump's name in response to a terrorist attack in June 2017 were misleading. The video was actually shot in March 2017 and showed a small group of far-right activists, not a representation of Londoners' sentiments after the attack. The video and articles were part of a larger dispute between Khan and Trump.

819,"### Context: Texas Governor Rick Perry claimed that President Barack Obama's overturning of the Mexico City Policy allows federal tax dollars to be used to fund abortions worldwide. The Mexico City Policy, first implemented by President Ronald Reagan, requires foreign non-governmental organizations receiving U.S. family planning funds to agree not to perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning outside of the United States. The policy has been in place during Republican administrations and repealed during Democratic ones. However, a 1973 federal law known as the Helms amendment prohibits U.S. foreign aid from paying for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries. This law was in effect before the Mexico City Policy and remains in effect regardless of the policy. The Helms amendment states that no U.S. funds can be used directly to pay for abortion as a method of family planning abroad, although foreign NGOs receiving U.S. aid can use other money to perform abortions in countries where it is legal. The Mexico City Policy prevents groups receiving U.S. family planning aid from providing abortions, regardless of the funding source. With the policy's repeal, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning money. However, USAID, the agency responsible for distributing the funds, has a compliance system in place to ensure that the funds are not used for prohibited activities. Each award to a foreign NGO is for a specific purpose, and written agreements specify limits such as the Helms amendment. Recipients are required to account for how the funds are spent, and USAID workers monitor the programs. While it is possible that some aid could be misspent or that U.S. aid could free up other money to go toward abortions, there is no evidence to support Perry's claim that U.S. family planning funds are enabling specific NGOs to perform abortions. Overall, Perry's statement is rated as Barely True.

820,"### Context: A study of 418 people with type 2 diabetes in Europe and Australia found that Sanofi's Lantus insulin was associated with a lower risk of low blood sugar levels compared to a rival insulin called Humalog. The study, published in the journal Lancet, concluded that Lantus provides a simple and effective option for early initiation of insulin therapy. Diabetes is a condition where blood glucose levels are too high, which can lead to various complications. Insulin treatments aim to lower blood sugar levels without causing hypoglycemia, a condition that can be dangerous. During the 44-week trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either Lantus or Humalog injections. Lantus reduced blood sugar levels to 7 percent from 8.7 percent, while Humalog decreased levels to 6.8 percent from 8.7 percent. Doctors aim for concentrations of less than 7 percent to reduce the risk of complications. The study also found that rates of hypoglycemia were lower for people using Lantus compared to Humalog. Lantus patients reported greater overall treatment satisfaction, likely due to the convenience of fewer daily injections.
Claim: Sanofi's Lantus insulin favored over rival: study.

821,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck that Chile ranks far ahead of the United States in terms of economic freedom. Beck cited a study by the Cato Institute that ranked Chile third and the United States 17th in terms of economic freedom. However, upon further investigation, it was found that the Cato Institute study actually ranked Chile fifth and the United States sixth. Other studies, such as the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom and the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, also ranked the United States higher than Chile in terms of economic freedom. 

Despite the discrepancy in rankings, experts agree that Chile has indeed improved its economic position in recent years and that free-market policies have played a role in this improvement. Chile is considered a success story in terms of economic development and has embraced free trade and market-oriented policies. The country has seen significant improvements in living standards and is often cited as an example of how free-market principles can lead to economic prosperity.

In conclusion, while Chile has made strides in terms of economic freedom, it is not ranked far ahead of the United States as claimed by Glenn Beck. The United States ranks higher than Chile in several measures of economic freedom. However, the overall assessment that Chile has improved its economic position and that free-market policies have contributed to this improvement is accurate.
Claim: Chile ranks third internationally in economic freedom, while the U.S. ranks 17th.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Beck says Chile easily tops U.S. in ""economic freedom"" rankings","Chile ranks third internationally in economic freedom, while the U.S. ranks 17th.",Beck said that Chile ranks far ahead of the United States in terms of economic freedom. The United States does rank higher than Chile in several measures of economic freedom. The overall assessment that Chile has improved its economic position and that free-market policies have contributed to that improvement is correct. But the claim that Chile ranks far ahead of the United States is wrong.
822,"### Context: The claim states that in July 2020, Betsy DeVos, the U.S. Education Secretary, made a statement suggesting that only 0.02% of the country's K-12 school students, totaling 14,740 children and teens, are likely to die from COVID-19 if schools fully reopen. However, an analysis of DeVos' public appearances found no evidence to support this claim.

The article mentions that President Donald Trump criticized the advice of public health experts on reopening schools during the pandemic and campaigned for in-person classes to resume nationwide. He even threatened to withhold federal funding from school systems that did not agree with his approach. DeVos, as the Secretary of Education, supported Trump's push to reopen schools and emphasized how it would benefit the country's economy.

The article then addresses the claim about DeVos stating the projected death toll of students if schools fully reopen. It mentions that the claim's origin is unclear, but the article provides some context from DeVos' public appearances. In a speech on July 7, 2020, DeVos emphasized the need for schools to fully reopen and operate, stating that anything short of that would rob students and taxpayers of their futures. She praised some school systems for their transition to remote learning but criticized others for doing ""next to nothing"" to teach students during the pandemic.

DeVos also appeared in interviews on CNN and Fox News, where she reiterated her belief that schools should fully reopen in the fall, despite the rising COVID-19 cases. She downplayed the health risks to students and referred to unspecified data suggesting that it is more a matter of their health and well-being to be back in school. DeVos pointed to research indicating that children are less likely to suffer severe symptoms from COVID-19 compared to adults.

In conclusion, the article states that there is no evidence to support the claim that DeVos stated a projected death toll of 14,740 students if schools fully reopen. While DeVos advocated for schools to reopen and downplayed the health risks to students, she did not make the specific statement mentioned in the claim.
Claim: In July 2020, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said ""only"" .02% of the country's K-12 school students — totaling 14,740 children and teens — are likely to die from COVID-19 when and if schools fully reopen.

823,"### Context: The article titled ""Stem Cell Research: The Quest Resumes"" discusses the current state of stem cell research and its potential for medical treatments. The article mentions that there are currently no treatments available, rendering the claim of treatments not applicable. It highlights that successful treatments are not guaranteed and the safety of using stem cells in humans has not been proven. The possibility of cancer as a side effect is mentioned, as well as the fact that the most promising type of stem cells have not fully developed into their original counterparts.

The article effectively describes the history and current status of stem cell research, emphasizing that evidence of any benefit is preliminary and knowledge is still developing. It generates emotion and a sense of urgency by sharing the story of Douglas Melton's children, who have Type 1 diabetes and could potentially benefit from stem cell treatments resulting from his research. The use of these anecdotes is deemed appropriate in this case.

The author quotes four sources, including experts in the field who are familiar with Melton's research. It is noted that all sources have some interest in positive outcomes of the research, whether personal, professional, political, or financial. The author should have indicated this bias. However, overall, the sourcing is considered satisfactory. It is suggested that including the voice of someone skeptical about the safety and imminence of stem cell therapies would have been useful.

The article mentions that Type 1 diabetes and Parkinson's disease, two conditions targeted by stem cell therapies under development, currently have no cures. However, the article does not discuss how these patients are currently treated as it focuses on basic stem cell research conducted in vitro and in animals. It does mention that the FDA has recently approved the first small trial of stem cells in patients with severe spinal cord injuries.

Overall, the article provides a detailed history and context of stem cell research, allowing readers to appreciate the new and novel aspects of the field. It is clear that the article did not rely on a news release.

",true,"This is a first-rate piece of magazine journalism. The article, as much about basic stem cell science as about medical treatment, focuses on one key researcher’s efforts to advance understanding of stem cells. The article puts those efforts in the context of politics, past and current research and the potential for clinical application. It personalizes the story without generating false emotion or hope. It’s a strong example of how journalists can educate the public about the importance and difficulties of scientific research–something that’s very useful against a backdrop of so much out-of-context, misleading reporting about the benefits and dangers of drugs and treatments. It’s particularly useful in an area where political interests have distorted some underlying scientific issues. The story could have been made even stronger if the author had talked to politically neutral people who for scientific reasons are less sanguine about the outcomes of stem cell research. The scientific community has endured years of having to defend the importance–indeed, the legality–of work with stem cells. This has resulted in a nearly united front in the field advancing the message that stem cell research is on the cusp of life-saving application and a transforming force in the history of medicine. This may turn out to be accurate. It may not. Only at the very end does the story explore the safety and efficacy issues that are important barriers to clinical application.

In 2007, documents were discovered revealing the Frank family's desperate attempts to escape Nazi-occupied Holland in 1941. Anne's father, Otto Frank, wrote to a college friend, Nathan Straus Jr., asking for help in securing a $5,000 bond to enter the United States. The papers illustrate the difficult process for gaining entry to the United States at that time, even for European Jews with connections and money. Otto Frank ultimately decided to try to enter through Cuba, but by June 1941, no one with close relatives still in Germany was allowed into the United States due to suspicions that the Nazis could use them for blackmail. Otto Frank was granted a single visa for himself, but it was canceled when Germany declared war on the United States. Holocaust scholars lamented the family's failed attempt at passage, stating that if Otto Frank had sought help sooner, Anne Frank could have been a 77-year-old woman living in Boston today. The Frank family's plight was only first reported in 2007, so it may not have been widely known before that. Anne Frank and her family ultimately perished in the Holocaust, likely from typhus, at Bergen-Belsen in 1945. Anne Frank's step-sister, Eva Schloss, has drawn parallels between the Syrian refugee crisis and the Jewish refugee crisis of World War II, urging people to help those in desperate situations.

825,"### Context: The article claims that the state of California ignored structural issues with the Oroville Dam and instead spent money on programs for undocumented immigrants. However, this claim is inaccurate. While it is true that environmental groups had been warning about structural deficiencies at the dam since before Governor Jerry Brown took office, the dam and programs for undocumented immigrants are funded from separate budget sources, so spending on one does not impact the other. The construction, operation, and maintenance costs of the dam are paid by public water agencies, not the state budget.

The article also mentions that critics of California's spending on high-speed rail and services for undocumented immigrants drew parallels to the state's failure to invest in the Oroville Dam. However, it is important to note that the emergency spillway had never been used until this year, and the catastrophic rainstorms came as a shock after five years of drought.

The article references a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform that claims undocumented immigrants cost California $25.3 billion annually. However, this study is questionable because it includes American citizens born to undocumented parents in its estimation of the cost. There is no confirmation that undocumented people cost California taxpayers $25 billion yearly.

Furthermore, the article mentions that environmental experts have been warning officials about the compromised spillway since 2003. In 2005, three environmental groups filed a motion urging state officials to armor the emergency spillway with concrete, but federal officials determined that the spillway would perform as designed. However, in February 2017, flooding due to storms forced nearly 200,000 residents to evacuate their homes.

In summary, the claim that the state of California ignored structural issues with the Oroville Dam and paid for programs to benefit undocumented people instead is inaccurate. The dam and programs for undocumented immigrants are funded separately, and the warnings about the dam's deficiencies predate Governor Jerry Brown's tenure. The article also mentions a study that includes American citizens in its estimation of the cost of undocumented immigrants, which is questionable. Environmental experts have been warning about the compromised spillway since 2003, but federal officials determined that it would perform as designed.

The post gained significant attention on Facebook, with over 100,000 shares and likes. However, it should be noted that the boy's mother had not commented on the claim, and the original post was the only place where the claim appeared online.

One user forwarded the post to Target, the retailer where the watch was allegedly purchased, and questioned the veracity of the claim. Target responded by stating that they were looking into the matter and requested the user to provide more information via email.

TruthorFiction.com also reached out to Target for comment, and updates on the investigation will be posted on their website. The Spider-Man watch in question does not appear on Target's website, and it is unclear if the watch was ever offered for sale by the retailer.

The article mentions that battery acid leaking from batteries used in household items like watches can cause chemical burns in children. The Texas Department of State Health Services warns that children can suffer chemical burns from damaged or misused batteries in toys. However, it is not clear if this was the cause of the burns in this particular case.

In conclusion, the investigation into the claim that a Spider-Man watch caused chemical burns on a boy's wrist is ongoing. The post gained significant attention on Facebook, but it is unclear if the claim is true. Target and TruthorFiction.com are both looking into the matter, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.

828,"### Context: Disability rights advocates in Montana have filed a lawsuit against the state over Medicaid cuts. The lawsuit argues that the cuts, which were authorized by the 2017 Legislature, are unlawful and unconstitutional. While the legislature allowed for reimbursement rate cuts for primary health care services in the case of funding shortfalls, it did not authorize cuts in community-based services for people with disabilities or serious mental illness. The lawsuit claims that the Department of Public Health and Human Services failed to follow state rule-making requirements in authorizing the reductions, leading to staff cuts, wage reductions, office closures, and discontinued services by providers. The lawsuit also argues that the Medicaid cuts violate the integration mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as they put patients at increased risk of institutionalization. Governor Steve Bullock recently announced that some cuts would be restored, but it is unclear when or how the rates will change. The health department plans to hold a listening session to set priorities in restoring targeted case management services. However, the petitioners are asking a judge to issue a temporary restraining order against the continued cuts and to schedule a hearing on a preliminary injunction. The organizations involved in the lawsuit claim that clients are losing their homes and jobs as a result of the cuts and are seeking services through hospitals, nursing homes, or state institutions. They argue that community-based services for the physically disabled and severely mentally ill are less expensive than institutionalization or placement in less restrictive settings. This lawsuit follows a similar one filed by the Montana Health Care Association in June, which alleges that the health department did not follow state rule-making processes in reducing Medicaid provider reimbursement rates for nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.

829,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests mammograms save lives for women in their 40s. However, the article fails to provide important information such as the costs of annual mammography screening, the cost of unnecessary biopsies or treatments for false positive diagnoses, and the number of women in the study cohort. The article also does not discuss the harms of screening women starting at age 40, such as false positive biopsies and unnecessary treatments. It does not mention the risks of additional radiation exposure or provide the number needed to harm for radiation exposure over 10 years of screening. The article quotes one of the study authors saying he could not pinpoint why his findings differed from other studies, but does not provide a thorough evaluation of the quality of the evidence. The article does provide the number needed to treat to place mortality risk in context, but does not discuss the downsides of treatment. It also does not interview a member of the US Preventive Services Task Force to discuss their reaction to the study. The article does not discuss the option of not screening and does not capture what was new and different about the research methodology. It appears to rely entirely on a teleconference sponsored by the conference host organization, without independent vetting of claims. Overall, the article falls short in providing a comprehensive analysis of the study and its implications.
Claim: Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40s, Study Says
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited. The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all. While this story begins telling readers that ""Another study…finds that screening can lower the risk of dying…"" –  look at how other competing stories began:   4th paragraph of AP story: ""The new study has major limitations and cannot account for possibly big differences in the groups of women it compares."" 1st paragraph of LA Times blog story:  ""Critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading."" 2nd sentence of NY Times story:  ""Results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit."" No such skepticism, no such independent critical evaluation took place in the HealthDay story. Women – especially in their 40s – must be terribly confused by the swirling studies. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November, the American Cancer Society and others’ backlash against it, the Norwegian study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and now the new Swedish study. This is when journalism must rise to the challenge with an extraordinary effort to help evaluate evidence, ask tough questions, and offer insightful analysis. That just didn’t happen with this story. It was more like stenography from a teleconference. Disappointing.","Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40s, Study Says","This story reports on a study that used a mathematical model to project the number of breast cancer deaths that would be prevented if all women in the US started getting mammograms at age 40 instead of age 50. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s methodology and the implications of the study’s findings for the US Preventive Services Task Force’s 2002 recommendation that women in their 40s should “make an individual decision” about whether to start getting mammograms. However, the story falls short in several important ways. It does not discuss the costs of annual mammography screening, the cost of unnecessary biopsies or treatments for false positive diagnoses, and it does not discuss the harms of screening women starting at age 40, such as false positive biopsies and unnecessary treatments. It does not mention the risks of additional radiation exposure or provide the number needed to harm for radiation exposure over 10 years of screening. The story also does not discuss the downsides of treatment.

830,"### Context: The claim that the media covered up an incident in San Bernardino where Muslim men fired upon hikers is not supported by credible news reports. Several unreliable websites reported this incident, claiming that a group of heavily armed Muslim men shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" and shot at hikers and campers in a state park. However, the Los Angeles Times, KCAL (a local television station), the Victorville Daily Press, and the Press-Enterprise all reported on the incident without mentioning any cover-up. According to the Los Angeles Times, police investigated reports of shooting and detained 17 men of Middle Eastern descent. However, none of them were arrested or charged in connection with shooting firearms, and they cooperated with deputies. The Press-Enterprise also reported that initial descriptions of the men's appearance as ""wearing turbans"" were inaccurate. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office issued a press release stating that deputies responded to reports of shots fired in the Deep Creek Hot Springs area and detained a group of males who were cooperative. A search of their belongings revealed handguns, a rifle, and a shotgun, all of which were registered except for the rifle. None of the detained men had a criminal history or outstanding warrants. Several hikers in the area were contacted, but none witnessed the guns being fired. The police report described the men as ""males,"" not ""Middle Eastern males"" or ""Muslim males."" The web site that started this rumor, Superstation95, is known for spreading misinformation and is run by Hal Turner, who has a criminal history. This site has made false claims in the past, including spreading misinformation about the Las Vegas strip incident and the San Bernardino mass shooting. In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the claim that the media covered up an incident in San Bernardino where Muslim men fired upon hikers.
Claim: The media covered up an incident in San Bernardino during which several Muslim men fired upon a number of Californian hikers.

831,"### Context: The Deerfield Village Board in Illinois has passed an ordinance that prohibits the possession of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban, which includes weapons such as the AR-15, will go into effect in June 2018. Violators of the ordinance could face fines of up to $1,000 per day for possessing a semi-automatic weapon within city limits. The ordinance cites the increasing use of assault weapons in mass shootings, including incidents in Parkland, Florida; Sutherland Springs, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Orlando, Florida. The definition of an ""assault weapon"" under the ordinance includes semi-automatic firearms that can accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition and have at least one additional feature outlined in the ordinance.

The village has clarified that police will not go door-to-door to confiscate assault weapons. Instead, gun owners are encouraged to voluntarily surrender their weapons and high-capacity magazines or render them inoperable. The ordinance will primarily be enforced through education and voluntary compliance, with police officers issuing citations for violations. Confiscation of illegally possessed weapons will be authorized by the ordinance, but any other enforcement actions, such as search or seizure, must comply with state and federal laws.

Violators of the assault weapons ban could face fines ranging from $250 to $1,000 per day for each day they are in violation of the ordinance. The National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action has announced its support for a legal challenge brought against the group Guns Save Life. The outcome of the legal challenge is uncertain, but the Deerfield ordinance is based on a similar ban in nearby Highland Park, which was upheld by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Chicago also has an assault weapons ban in place.

In summary, the Village of Deerfield in Illinois has passed an ordinance banning the possession of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The ban will be enforced through education and voluntary compliance, with fines imposed for violations. The National Rifle Association is supporting a legal challenge against the ban, but a similar ban in Highland Park has already been upheld by the courts.

832,"### Context: A boy with a rare, incurable skin disease called junctional epidermolysis bullosa has been successfully treated with gene therapy, according to doctors at the University of Modena in Italy. The boy, who was 7 years old at the time, was hospitalized in June 2015 with severe blisters on his skin. He quickly lost about 60 percent of the outer layer of his skin and was put into an induced coma. Doctors in Germany attempted skin grafts from his father and donor skin, but all failed. The boy's parents then asked about experimental treatments and were referred to Dr. Michele De Luca and his colleagues in Italy.

The doctors used gene therapy to produce a small piece of the boy's skin in the lab. They took a small piece of the boy's healthy skin and added a normal version of his faulty gene to his skin cells. They grew sheets of the boy's skin in the lab, ultimately covering 80 percent of his body. Ten days after the transplant, the new skin was already beginning to grow. After eight months, nearly all of the boy's skin had been generated by the modified stem cells. The boy is now doing well, doesn't need any medication, is back in school, and even playing soccer.

The doctors published details of the case in the journal Nature, stating that this treatment is a huge step forward. However, other experts caution that the approach might not help in more serious cases with complications like skin blistering in the lungs. Some severely ill patients might also have an extreme immune reaction to the skin transplants with the added gene. Despite these concerns, the doctors believe that the treatment is worth trying in dying patients.

The boy and his family visited the doctors in Italy after the successful treatment, and the parents expressed their gratitude, saying that their lives have completely changed. The boy was so happy with his new skin that he wanted to show it off.

Overall, this article highlights the successful use of gene therapy to treat a boy with a rare skin disease. The treatment involved growing sheets of the boy's skin in the lab using modified stem cells. The boy's condition improved significantly, and he is now leading a normal life without the need for medication.

833,"### Context: McDonald's, the world's largest hamburger chain, has announced that it will start listing calorie information on menus in its 14,000 U.S. restaurants and drive-throughs. This move comes ahead of a national rule that will require larger restaurant chains to disclose calorie information. McDonald's is seen as a trendsetter in the restaurant industry, and its decision is likely to prompt other operators to follow suit. Currently, the state of California and cities like New York already require calories to be clearly listed on menus. Under the new U.S. healthcare law, all restaurants across the country will soon be required to display calorie counts and other nutrition details on menus. The national rules will apply to restaurants with 20 or more locations, as well as other retail food outlets. McDonald's was initially opposed to calorie labeling, but it has now embraced the move as a way to help customers understand their food choices. The company sees this as a business opportunity and hopes that it will encourage customers to visit more often. The national calorie labeling deadline is expected to be around the end of 2013, so McDonald's customers will be receiving this information about a year earlier than required. The disclosure rules have already influenced many restaurants, including Starbucks, to reduce calories in their food and highlight healthier options. McDonald's has also made efforts to make its menu items healthier, such as reducing the portion size of french fries in Happy Meals and adding apples to every order. The company plans to add more fresh fruits and vegetables to its menu and aims to decrease calories, saturated fat, and added sugars across its U.S. menu by 2020. However, advocacy groups like Corporate Accountability International believe that McDonald's needs to make more fundamental changes to address its health impact, such as stopping advertising to children. Other restaurant chains, such as Panera Bread and Subway, have already voluntarily posted calorie counts in their stores. McDonald's shares were down in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

835,"### Context: Robin Lehner, a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender, has had a remarkable season after disclosing his struggles with mental illness. The 27-year-old Swede, who has bipolar disorder, set a career high with 25 victories, a 2.13 goals-against average, and a .930 save percentage. Alongside Thomas Greiss, Lehner helped the New York Islanders go from worst to first in the league in goals allowed. Lehner's performance in the first round of the playoffs against the Pittsburgh Penguins was instrumental in the Islanders' advancement to the second round. Lehner's teammates have been supportive of him, with captain Anders Lee emphasizing the importance of being there for him and letting him know they have his back.

Lehner first revealed his mental health struggles in an essay published by The Athletic in September. He detailed his diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder and his path to seeking help from the NHL/NHLPA Substance Abuse & Behavioral Help program. Lehner's journey has been challenging, but he has received support from his family, support staff, and the Islanders organization. General manager Lou Lamoriello signed Lehner to a one-year contract, known as a ""prove-it"" deal, and Lehner has exceeded expectations.

Lehner's courage in sharing his story has been widely recognized, with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman praising him as a role model. The attitudes towards mental health in hockey have evolved, with former NHL goaltender Corey Hirsch also speaking out about his own mental health issues. Lehner's success on and off the ice has shattered the notion that mental illness makes someone mentally weak.

Lehner's life and career have improved since he confronted his mental health issues. He has learned how to manage his condition and has the support of his wife and teammates. Lehner hopes that by sharing his struggles, he can educate the public and inspire others who are dealing with similar challenges. His teammates admire his determination to help others and see him as a success story. Overall, Lehner's journey has been a testament to the power of resilience and the importance of mental health awareness in professional sports.

836,"### Context: The article discusses a study on the use of the drug candesartan, an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), to prevent hypertension in prehypertensive individuals. However, the article fails to mention the cost of these ARB drugs, which are typically more expensive than other anti-hypertensive medications. There is also no comparison of ARB treatment with less costly medications or lifestyle modifications.

The benefits of treatment are oversimplified, with no mention of relative or absolute risk reduction. The article also does not mention the side effects of ARBs, which include cough, elevated potassium levels, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, abnormal taste sensation, and rash. The study found that gastrointestinal problems, dizziness, and headaches were more common in the treatment group, but the difference was small.

There is no mention of the long-term safety of being on these medications for years as prevention. The study design is mentioned, but there is no mention that it was double-blinded. The article also fails to mention the question of whether prehypertension alone is a strong predictor of future heart disease.

The article mentions that the makers of the anti-hypertensive medication sponsored and helped design the study. The lead author of the study also serves as a consultant to the drug company and has other grant support from the makers of the drug, which was not disclosed.

Overall, the article lacks important information regarding the cost, side effects, long-term safety, and effectiveness of ARB drugs for preventing hypertension. It also fails to adequately cover the advantages and disadvantages of lifestyle modifications and medication.
Claim: Drug may delay high blood pressure in some
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This article discusses a recent New England Journal of Medicine article on a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial of candesartan, an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), to prevent hypertension in prehypertensive patients. Candesartan works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes blood vessels and this lowers blood pressure. There is evidence of disease mongering in this story: The classification of “prehypertension” (systolic 130-139 mm Hg and 85-89 mm Hg diastolic) is still debatable by some medical experts, and whether prehypertension alone is a strong predictor of future heart disease is also debatable. Blood pressure increases as a natural part of aging, so whether prehypertension or mild hypertension should be viewed as a condition or disease and treated with costly medication needs further study. Hypertension is only one of several risk factors that contributes to heart disease. A prehypertensive or mildly hypertensive person with low risk factors and a healthy lifestyle may not benefit from drug treatment as much as someone with greater risk of heart disease and an unhealthy behaviors, such as a poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking. The story does mention lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, as a “cornerstone of controlling blood pressure,” however, comparison is only anecdotal and there is no mention of studies examining the effect of lifestyle modification on prehypertension or hypertension. The story mentions limiting salt and water as part of lifestyle modification. A reduced sodium diet may help control hypertension, but reducing water will not help most people decrease blood pressure. There is not much quantitative information on the risk reduction from taking an ARB to prevent hypertension. There was some modest protective benefit in the treatment group at 4 years (absolute reduction 9.8%), though the story says those who took the drug for 2 years and then a placebo for an additional 2 years “matched the placebo group”. There is no discussion of the side effects of this anti-hypertensive drug, nor is there discussion of long-term safety of taking this medication for many years as a means of prevention. The most common side effects of ARBs are cough, elevated potassium levels, low blood pressure, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, abnormal taste sensation (metallic or salty taste), and rash. In this study, gastrointestinal problems, dizziness and headaches were more common in the treatment group, though in most cases, the difference was small. This class of drugs are typically more expensive than other anti-hypertensive medications, but there is no mention of the cost of taking this medication daily for prevention of hypertension. Also, there is no comparison of ARB treatment with less costly anti-hypertensive medications such a diuretics, or a cost comparison with lifestyle modification. Lastly, the story appropriately notes that the makers of the candesartan sponsored and help design the study. What is not mentioned is that the lead author also serves as a consultant to the drug company and has other grant support from AstraZeneca, the makers of the drug.",Drug may delay high blood pressure in some,"This story reports on a recent study that found the use of the drug candesartan, an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), to prevent hypertension in prehypertensive individuals.

837,"### Context: The claim that lack of affordable healthcare causes more deaths per year than terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined is examined in this article. The article discusses the rarity of terrorist attacks in the United States and the relatively small number of fatalities they cause. It explains that terrorist attacks are typically driven by a cause and the victims are often not individually targeted. The article cites data from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), which shows that between 1995 and 2017, there were 3,516 deaths associated with terrorist attacks in the US, with a median annual number of four deaths. The article also mentions a report by the Cato Institute, which focuses on terrorist acts perpetrated by foreign-born assailants and states that between 1975 and 2015, there were 2,983 deaths related to such attacks.

Regarding illegal immigration, the article notes that studies have shown that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. It mentions a study by the Government Accountability Office, which found that between 1955 and 2010, there were 25,064 arrests of undocumented immigrants on homicide charges. However, the article acknowledges that not all arrests lead to convictions, and even the highest possible conversion rate would result in an average of 448 undocumented immigrants per year being convicted of homicides during that period. Another report by the Cato Institute states that in Texas in 2015, undocumented immigrants accounted for 5.9% of homicide convictions, while native-born Americans accounted for 90.3% of convictions.

The article then discusses estimates of deaths caused by a lack of affordable healthcare. It mentions a 2009 study that estimated 44,789 deaths in the US in 2005 were associated with a lack of health insurance. Other estimates have varied, with some suggesting that the repeal of Obamacare could cause as many as 36,000 deaths per year. The article acknowledges the difficulty in precisely attributing a lack of health insurance as the primary cause of death.

In conclusion, the article states that it is unlikely that lack of affordable healthcare causes fewer than 1,000 deaths per year, which is the combined number of deaths attributable to terrorist attacks and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants. However, it also acknowledges the complexities and ambiguities involved in estimating the number of deaths caused by the lack of affordable healthcare. The article gives a mixed verdict to the claim, stating that there is no definitive estimate and that there is at least one study that found lacking insurance did not cause a substantive difference in the number of deaths.
Claim: Lack of affordable healthcare accounts for a greater number of deaths per year than do terrorist attacks and illegal immigration combined.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"What's true: Terrorist acts and homicides committed by undocumented immigrants account for a relatively very small portion of all violent deaths in the United States, and some research has concluded that the lack of affordable healthcare causes many more deaths each year.

838,"### Context: The article clarifies the claim that U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren supports taxpayer-funded sex reassignment surgery. The claim originated from an article published by the right-leaning website OneNewsNow, which reported that Warren launched a fight to have taxpayer dollars fund ""gender-affirming healthcare"" and sex-changing surgery. However, the source cited by OneNewsNow did not involve Warren saying those exact words, and the phrasing of the headline may have been misleading.

Upon examination of the record and confirmation from Warren's 2020 presidential campaign, it is clear that she does support covering sex-reassignment surgery under taxpayer-funded programs like Medicaid, as well as full legal access to the surgery under private health insurance and Obamacare. The Warren campaign confirmed that she supports gender-reassignment surgery and other transition-related services being made available at low or no cost under taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, Obamacare, and private health insurance policies.

The article provides context on Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which prohibits healthcare and insurance providers that receive federal funding from discriminating against patients based on their sex, race, religion, national origin, and gender identity. In 2016, the Obama administration implemented a rule that expanded these protections to include discrimination based on gender identity and coverage for treatments related to gender transition, such as sex-reassignment surgery. However, in 2019, the Trump administration proposed a rule to reverse these expansions.

The article includes an interview with Warren conducted in September 2019, where she expressed her support for protecting the rights and healthcare of transgender individuals. She stated that discrimination against transgender Americans is unconstitutional and pledged to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance, upholding civil rights and nondiscrimination protections. This means that sex-reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare.

In conclusion, while the specific quote ""taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery"" was not directly attributed to Elizabeth Warren, she does support taxpayer-funded coverage for sex-reassignment surgery under certain federal programs. The claim is accurate, but the headline of the OneNewsNow article may have been misleading.
Claim: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said or argued to the effect that ""taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.

839,"### Context: Bodycad, a Canadian medical device company, has announced the successful implantation of its personalized knee replacement system, called the Unicompartmental Knee System, in two patients. The company claims that its 3D printed knee replacements provide a better fit and therefore better results compared to traditional knee replacements. However, the news release does not provide any data or evidence to support these claims.

The news release does not mention the cost of the device or the implantation surgery, making it difficult to assess the affordability of the personalized knee replacements. It also does not provide any information about the time it takes to manufacture the device or the materials used, making it impossible to estimate the materials costs.

There is no mention of any potential harms or risks associated with knee replacement surgery in general or with the 3D printed knee replacement specifically. The release also does not provide any evidence to support the claims made by the company. While there are testimonials from two surgeons who implanted the devices and a statement from the president of Bodycad, no references are provided for the evidence mentioned.

The news release does not establish the novelty of the personalized knee replacement system, as it implies that other companies are also making similar devices. It also does not provide any data comparing the personalized devices to conventional ones, making it unclear if the personalized devices are actually better.

The release mentions that the devices have been cleared for use in the U.S. and Europe, indicating that they are available. However, it is unknown how many surgeons have been trained in the use of these devices.

The news release also fails to disclose any conflicts of interest. One of the surgeons quoted in the release has received funding from manufacturers of joint replacement devices, which should have been mentioned.

Overall, the news release from Bodycad lacks important information and evidence to support its claims about the benefits of its personalized knee replacement system. It also fails to disclose potential harms and conflicts of interest.
Claim: Bodycad Announces First Use of Its Unicompartmental Knee System in Patients
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release announces the first two implantations of Bodycad’s Unicompartmental Knee System, knee replacement devices manufactured for individual patients using 3D printing technology and Bodycad’s “proprietary methods.” Despite claims throughout that the 3D printed devices result in “a better fit” and “the potential for improved clinical results,” the company offers no data or evidence and does not reference any studies measuring the effectiveness of the devices. The device has received clearance from the FDA in a letter stating the device is “substantially equivalent” to existing devices already in use. It should give readers pause that neither the news release or FDA letter indicate that any studies on patient outcomes were completed or even required. We offer a primer that describes the weak regulations governing approval of medical devices like this one. The news release neglected to mention that one of the surgeons quoted received more than $90,000 in payments from two manufacturers of joint replacement devices during 2016. Many people receiving knee replacements (or knee arthroplasty) are elderly and with our aging population, it’s expected the numbers of these procedures will keep growing. Estimates on the number of knee replacements performed each year in the US vary, but are projected to reach 3.4 million by 2030. Devices manufactured specifically for individuals to replicate their existing knee joint could potentially improve clinical outcomes but studies of this device are still needed to show its benefit.",Bodycad Announces First Use of Its Unicompartmental Knee System in Patients,"This news release from a Canadian medical device company announces the first two implantations of its personalized 3D printed knee replacement system. The release provides no data to support the claims made by the company that the personalized devices provide a better fit and therefore better results than conventional knee replacements. The release also fails to mention the cost of the device or the surgery, and it doesn’t establish the novelty of the device. The release also fails to disclose that one of the surgeons quoted in the release has received funding from manufacturers of joint replacement devices. Knee osteoarthritis is a common problem in the aging population. It is a painful condition that can lead to disability. Knee replacement is a common treatment for this condition. The release claims that the Bodycad device is superior to conventional knee replacements. However, the release provides no evidence to support this claim."
840,"### Context: The claim that the Seal of the President of the United States undergoes a change in wartime, with the eagle's head facing the opposite direction, is not true. The design of the Seal is fixed by executive order and does not change during wartime. However, the Seal has undergone modifications over the years. In 1945, President Truman modified the Seal, including turning the eagle's head to face its right instead of its left. A press release at the time stated that the eagle now faced the olive branches of peace in its right talon, whereas before it faced the arrows of war in its left talon. Since then, the eagle on the Presidential Seal has faced its right. 

There are items in the White House collection made before 1945 that display the eagle facing its left, but these are older items. The change in the eagle's head direction on the Presidential Seal was not related to wartime, but rather a modification made by President Truman to symbolize a nation on the march and dedicated to peace. 

The notion of a presidential seal with an eagle whose gaze changed direction based on the state of war was a mistaken assumption. The eagle's head on the presidential flag or seal had changed around the time of World War I and World War II, but these changes were coincidental and not connected to wartime. 

In conclusion, the claim that the Seal of the President of the United States is modified during wartime with the eagle's head facing the opposite direction is false. The design of the Seal is fixed and has undergone modifications over the years, but these changes were not related to wartime.
Claim: During wartime, the Seal of the President of the United States is modified so that the eagle's head faces the opposite direction.

841,"### Context: A new study has found that weight loss can reverse diabetes. The study involved a diet intervention that included weeks of a liquid formula diet, along with support services such as nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy. The story quantifies the amount of weight people lost and how many people went into remission in both the diet group and the control group. Remission was defined as having a hemoglobin A1c level below the threshold for diagnosis without taking any diabetes medications. However, the story does not explain what remission is or how it was measured. The study found that most people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds and nearly a quarter of them were able to lose 33 pounds or more. The story mentions that there were side effects during the intervention, such as constipation, headache, increased cold sensitivity, and dizziness, but these tended to dissipate over time. The story also mentions that gastric bypass surgery has been shown to reverse diabetes, but it is expensive and carries risks. The story does not mention the costs or harms of the diet intervention. The story outlines the components of the diet but does not mention whether it can be accessed from a physician. It is likely that healthcare providers' help would be necessary due to the extremeness of the diet and the difficulty of maintaining weight loss. The study's findings are distinguished from previous evidence that weight loss can prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes and help manage diabetes itself. The story does not rely on the press release from The Lancet, the journal that published the study.
Claim: Weight Loss Really Can Reverse Diabetes, New Study Finds
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This Time story reports a study about reversing recently diagnosed diabetes via substantial weight loss. One strength of the story is its description of what happens in the body with diabetes and how medications deal with blood sugar, but not the underlying problem. The story competently describes the study methods and findings, but does not address any downsides, namely potential harms or costs, of the strict diet that was used to achieve the weight loss. New ways to treat type 2 diabetes are always newsworthy because the numbers of people with the condition are so large — about 30 million Americans, or nearly 10% of the population, have the disease. What’s newsworthy here is that a short extreme dietary intervention, followed by a less extreme intervention, was adhered to by nearly 80% of people and led to remission of diabetes in a large percentage of them. It will be important to see how these people do in the long-run–if the remission stands the test of time.","Weight Loss Really Can Reverse Diabetes, New Study Finds","This story reports on a study that found a very low-calorie diet can help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight and go into remission. The story does a good job of quantifying the benefits of the diet and explaining the study’s limitations. However, it doesn’t mention the costs or harms of the diet, and it doesn’t explain what remission is or how it was measured. It also doesn’t mention that the study was funded by Viralyx, a company that makes the formula diet used in the study. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people. It can lead to serious health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. A diet that can help people go into remission is a welcome addition to the treatment options available."
842,"### Context: Hillary Clinton has a reputation for being cozy with Wall Street, but in her 2016 campaign, she has been striking populist tones. Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. She stated that as president, she would go ""beyond Dodd-Frank"" and address the risks of derivatives, crack down on subprime mortgages, and improve financial oversight. Clinton has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. 

During her ill-fated presidential primary campaign in 2007, Clinton addressed the nascent issues of the financial crisis, particularly the mortgage crisis. She gave speeches on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market and proposed specific solutions, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, safeguards against predatory lending practices, and policies to prevent foreclosures. In September 2007, Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies. 

In November 2007, Clinton mentioned derivatives for the first time in a speech in Iowa. She emphasized the need to address the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products. She also called for more oversight of financial markets. In March 2008, before the financial crisis hit its peak, Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation, which included more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards, and strengthened consumer protections. 

After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. However, it is clear that addressing the financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. 

Overall, Clinton's statement that she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis is accurate.
Claim: Hillary Clinton Says she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis.

### Explanation:
",true,"Clinton said she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis. The crisis hit a peak in summer 2008, though it started to gain traction in 2007. Clinton began addressing the subprime mortgage issue in her appearances in March 2007. Later that year, she took on derivatives. She also proposed specific plans for solving these problems and increasing oversight of financial institutions. Her statement is accurate.","Hillary Clinton Says she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis.","Clinton said she """"called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"""" early on in the financial crisis.

843,"### Context: Over a dozen people were arrested in South Carolina following the fourth Poor People's Rally. The rally included a ""lie-in"" where nearly two dozen people called for a ""moral revival"" of the health care system and an immediate expansion of Medicaid. After the protest, about a dozen demonstrators blocked U.S. Highway 1 in front of the capitol and were arrested by Columbia police. The protesters were holding signs that read ""Death Runs the Statehouse"" and ""Our Blood Your Hands!""

Columbia minister Charles Rhodes, one of the arrested protesters, stated that it is time for clergy and citizens to take a stand against what he called moral wrongs. He emphasized that the cost of medical care burdens many people, particularly the poor, elderly, and others impacted by the attempt to destroy Obamacare.

Physician David Keely of Rock Hill spoke at the rally and urged protesters to question their local lawmakers about their stance on health care. He emphasized the importance of preventative medications in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Keely also highlighted the significant health disparities in South Carolina, particularly for those with lower incomes.

The Rev. William Barber, campaign president and co-chair, criticized South Carolina lawmakers for creating ""policy violence"" by blocking living wages and health care expansion. He argued that these policies lead to death.

The rally in South Carolina was part of a 40-day nonviolent national campaign, which will conclude with a rally in Washington in two weeks. This was the fourth recent rally held in Columbia, and similar rallies have taken place at state capitols across the country.

In summary, the article reports on the arrests of over a dozen protesters in South Carolina following the Poor People's Rally. The protesters called for a moral revival of the health care system and an expansion of Medicaid. They highlighted the impact of high medical costs on vulnerable populations and criticized lawmakers for blocking health care expansion. The rally was part of a larger national campaign that aims to address issues of poverty and inequality.

844,"### Context: The claim that London Mayor Sadiq Khan banned images of ""sexy"" women because they are offensive to Islam is not entirely accurate. The article explains that Khan announced a new policy that would ban advertisements which could cause body confidence issues, particularly among young people. The policy change was motivated by concerns about advertisements that demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies. Khan, who is a father of two teenage daughters, expressed his concern about this kind of advertising and stated that nobody should feel pressurized into unrealistic expectations surrounding their bodies while using public transport.

The article clarifies that the ban on advertisements would only affect a small fraction of the 12,000 adverts that run across the London transport network each year. The ban specifically targets ads that promote body shaming and unrealistic or unhealthy body shapes. It does not include all images of people in their underwear or swimming gear. The ban was not motivated by Khan's religion but rather by public outcry and passenger feedback. The article mentions a specific ad by Protein World, which featured a bikini-clad model and sparked a protest and a petition with over 70,000 signatures. This ad was not banned by the Advertising Standards Authority but contributed to the decision to change the advertising policy.

The article concludes by stating that Khan did not specify how standards for advertisements on public transit would be strengthened, but credible reporting indicates that the ban will solely affect ""body shaming"" content and not all ""sexy"" or revealing advertisements. The claim that Khan banned images of ""sexy"" women because they are offensive to Islam is misleading and does not accurately represent the motivations behind the policy change.

New technologies like a trial vaccine, experimental treatments and futuristic cube-shaped mobile units for treating patients have helped curb the spread of the virus. But public mistrust and rampant insecurity in the parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where Ebola has struck have hampered the response, complicating the fight against it. Five Ebola centers have been attacked since last month, sometimes by armed assailants. The violence led French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend its activities at the epicenter of the outbreak last month. As a result, it is now the second-deadliest in history, behind the 2013-16 one in West Africa that is believed to have killed more than 11,000 people. “The total is now 1,009 cases,” the ministry said in a statement, but it added: “the response, led by the Health Ministry in collaboration with its partners, has limited the geographical spread.”  Last Wednesday, authorities confirmed a case of Ebola in Bunia, another city of close to 1 million people.

Powassan, like Lyme, is a tick-borne infection. The proposal would make several changes, such as requiring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a national strategy to combat the diseases. It would also authorize the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide $20 million in grants per year to state health departments to improve data collection and make others changes.

848,"### Context: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., shared a manipulated video that falsely accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to defund the police. The video used manipulated footage of activist Ady Barkan, who has Lou Gehrig’s disease, to create the false impression. The video spliced together clips from a July interview between Biden and Barkan, altering Barkan's words to make it seem like he asked if Biden agreed to redirect funding for the police. However, Barkan never posed that question. Barkan called out Scalise on Twitter, stating that his words were doctored for political gain.

The manipulated video was flagged by Twitter as ""manipulated"" and Scalise deleted it, posting a new version without the spliced footage. However, Scalise's spokesperson defended the edit, claiming it was done for time and clarity. Scalise stood by the false suggestion that Biden wants to defund the police.

In reality, Biden has proposed additional police reforms and oversight and has called for a $300 million investment in a community policing grant program. The unedited audio recording of the interview between Biden and Barkan shows that Biden does not support defunding the police. Barkan never asked if funding could be redirected from the police. Instead, he proposed redirecting some police funds to social services and mental health counseling.

Biden has repeatedly rejected the idea of defunding the police in various statements, interviews, and questionnaires. He has proposed investing in the Community Oriented Policing Services Program and conditioning federal aid to police based on meeting certain standards.

Those close to Barkan, including Liz Jaff, the president of Barkan’s Be A Hero political fund, confirmed that Barkan and Biden agreed on many issues but disagreed on defunding the police. Jaff stated that Biden never expressed support for defunding the police during the interview.

In conclusion, Scalise shared a manipulated video that falsely accused Biden of wanting to defund the police.

849,"### Context: The article titled ""Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery"" discusses a study that suggests statin medications may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after surgery. The study, conducted in Ontario, Canada, analyzed the medical records of over 200,000 seniors who had elective surgery between 1995 and 2008. It found that patients who took statins had a 16% reduced risk of renal failure and a 21% lower risk of dying after surgery compared to those who did not take the drugs.

However, the article fails to mention the costs of statins, which are easily accessible, and the fact that in Canada, where the study was conducted, the costs of statins to the government should be quantifiable due to the universal healthcare system. The benefits of statins are presented in relative terms, which can be misleading to readers. The article provides absolute numbers, stating that out of 67,941 people, 1,208 suffered acute kidney injury without taking statins, while 1,039 suffered it while taking statins. This means that 169 fewer people suffered acute kidney injury while taking statins, assuming that statins had any effect. The article also fails to mention any risks or harms associated with statins, which is important when considering the potential extension of statin use to a larger population.

The study design is briefly outlined in the article, mentioning that it analyzed the medical records of seniors who had elective surgery. However, the article does not discuss the limitations of the study, including the fact that the observed association between statin use and AKI may not be causal. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a ""statin user"" were simply filling a statin prescription in the previous 90 days, which may not be a strong enough basis to prove that statins protect kidneys from failing.

The article also highlights the rise of AKI after surgery and its increased risk of patient death. However, it fails to provide a balanced perspective by stating that only about 2% of patients experience renal failure within two weeks of their procedures. The article also mentions that depending on how researchers define it, AKI may occur in up to 40% of patients, which can be confusing and alarming to readers.

The article does not include any independent sources and does not discuss current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This may lead readers to believe that taking statins is the only way to prevent renal injury or death. While the article acknowledges that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals, it emphasizes the importance of showing this relationship in humans as well.

Overall, the article relies heavily on the study's abstract and lacks deeper context. It does not address the costs or risks of statins, fails to provide a balanced perspective on the risk of renal failure after surgery, and does not discuss alternative treatment approaches.
Claim: Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story could have benefited from some strong, independent voices commenting on the findings and from a more careful explanation of the study itself. Readers deserved to know more about the study’s limitations, about the absolute differences seen in the groups studied and about the risks associated with statin use. The story went beyond the press release used to promote the study, but it needed to go much further in helping readers understand the strength of the findings and their potential impact on readers considering surgery. One of the risks associated with surgery is kidney failure, an outcome no patient or surgeon wants. To be able to reduce that risk by taking a pill would be a major boon to medicine. This study hints that statins could provide that benefit, but, as the authors themselves acknowledge, there are significant limitations to a backward-looking, uncontrolled study. Those limitations and the reality of the necessary steps to create a foundation for solid clinical practice needed to be acknowledged in this story and other coverage of the same topic.",Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery,"This story reports on a study that found that statin use was associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury and death after surgery.

850,"### Context: The claim that ""Roe v. Wade was passed only because Roe lied about being raped"" is not true. The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, which made access to abortion legal across the country, was not based on the claim of rape made by ""Jane Roe"" (whose real name is Norma McCorvey). The court ruled, in a 7-2 opinion, that women had a constitutional right to abortion under the 14th Amendment's right to privacy. The court's decision did not mention the circumstances of the plaintiff's pregnancy at all.

Norma McCorvey initially claimed to have been gang raped when seeking an abortion in Texas, but she later admitted in a 1987 interview that she had lied about the rape. She hoped that by claiming rape, she would be able to get around the Texas ban on abortion. However, McCorvey never ended up getting an abortion as her baby was born before the Supreme Court's decision. She gave up the child for adoption.

One of the lawyers who represented McCorvey at the Supreme Court, Sarah Weddington, stated that during the case, they never focused on the issue of rape but rather emphasized the question of whether the Constitution gives the state or the woman the authority to decide what she can do with her body.

In summary, while it is true that Norma McCorvey initially claimed to have been raped and later recanted, her false claim had no bearing on the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. The court's ruling was based on the constitutional right to privacy and the question of a woman's authority over her own body.

851,"### Context: The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer for their work in revolutionizing developmental economics. The three winners have conducted field experiments that provide practical insights into how poor people respond to education, healthcare, and other poverty-alleviation programs. Their research has shown that simply providing more textbooks, school meals, and teachers does not significantly improve student learning. Instead, making schoolwork more relevant to students, working closely with the neediest students, and holding teachers accountable have proven to be more effective strategies. The winners' recommended program of remedial tutoring is currently benefiting 5 million Indian children. 

The researchers also found that providing free healthcare and distributing de-worming pills for free significantly increased the rates of healthcare utilization. Additionally, their work in India showed that mobile vaccination clinics dramatically increased immunization rates compared to traditional health centers. The immunization rate further rose when parents received a bag of lentils as a bonus for vaccinating their children. 

However, the researchers found that microcredit programs, which provide small loans to encourage entrepreneurship among the poor, did not significantly help the poor in certain contexts. Their studies in various countries produced similar results. 

Despite progress, global poverty remains a significant challenge, with over 700 million people living in extreme poverty. The researchers emphasized the importance of understanding the intricacies of the lives of the poor in order to design effective poverty-alleviation approaches. 

Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, and Michael Kremer were surprised by the news of their Nobel Prize win. Duflo, at 46 years old, is the youngest person ever to win the prize and only the second woman. She hopes that her success will inspire other women to continue working and receive the respect they deserve in the field of economics. 

The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, comes with a cash award of 9 million kronor ($918,000), a gold medal, and a diploma. The winners will receive their awards on December 10 in Stockholm, except for the winner of the Peace Prize, who will receive the award in Oslo, Norway.

852,"### Context: The claim that the photograph circulating on Facebook shows the Mississippi River meeting the Gulf of Mexico and the two bodies of water never mixing is false. The image actually shows a man-made hypoxic event that is harmful to the environment. The video from which the image was taken captured a fluctuating dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico caused by high-nutrient water from the Mississippi River. This leads to large algae blooms, altered food chains, and oxygen-deficient waters. The majority of the land in Mississippi's watershed is farmland, and agricultural runoff is a major contributor to the nutrient loads that cause hypoxia. Urban areas that border the Mississippi also discharge treated sewage into rivers, adding to the nutrient influx. The decomposition of dead phytoplankton and zooplankton waste depletes oxygen faster than it can be replaced, resulting in large hypoxic areas called Dead Zones. These dead zones fluctuate in size and have a major impact on marine life in the Gulf of Mexico. Nutrient overloading and algal blooms reduce biodiversity and can lead to fish kills. The Gulf of Mexico is a major source area for the seafood industry, so the hypoxic zone can greatly impact fishermen and coastal state economies. The distinct color differences in the photograph are not a permanent year-round fixture, as the dead zone is a recurring environmental problem. While the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico is man-made, similar aesthetic effects can occur naturally in other parts of the world, such as the Gulf of Alaska where glacial rivers mix with the ocean.

GAVI, a public-private partnership supported by organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, WHO, World Bank, and UNICEF, is establishing a stockpile of 500,000 doses of the Ebola vaccine for emergency use in outbreaks. The stockpiling will begin with Merck's Ervebo vaccine. The company stated that the stockpile will be governed and executed by the owner of the stockpile, not by Merck.

The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads through direct contact with body fluids. It has a high fatality rate, killing around half of those infected. Since August 2018, there have been over 3,000 cases of Ebola, resulting in 2,199 deaths. In July 2019, the WHO declared it an international emergency. Merck is working closely with the U.S. government, WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI to prepare against the disease.

Johnson and Johnson's two-dose Ebola vaccine is currently under review by the European regulator, and the company is in discussions with the FDA for U.S. approval. Following the FDA's approval of Ervebo, Merck's shares rose by up to 2.8% to a record high of $92.55.

In summary, the FDA has approved the Ebola vaccine Ervebo, which was previously approved in Europe. Merck has committed to providing the vaccine at a low access price for GAVI-eligible countries. GAVI is establishing a stockpile of the vaccine for emergency use. The Ebola virus has caused thousands of cases and deaths since 2018, and Merck is collaborating with various organizations to combat the disease. Johnson and Johnson's vaccine is also undergoing regulatory review.

854,"### Context: The article claims that a Time magazine cover from 1977 titled ""The Big Freeze"" is an example of media fearmongering over ""global cooling"" in the 1970s. The author of the article argues that the cover was used as evidence by Snopes and other news organizations to debunk claims of global cooling, but the cover was actually about record-setting cold temperatures in the winter of 1977 and was explicitly filed under the subject ""weather."" The author suggests that Time magazine wanted to hide the existence of this cover by manufacturing a fake cover for fact-checkers to debunk. The author accuses Time magazine of launching a hoax and claims that Snopes adopted it and condemned ""climate deniers."" 

The article goes on to explain that the Time magazine cover discussed anomalously cold temperatures during the winter of 1977 and the impact it had on various aspects of American life, particularly shortages of natural gas. The author argues that the article was about weather, which is short-term fluctuations in environmental factors, rather than climate, which is concerned with long-term averages. The author also mentions that media reports from the 1970s did raise concerns about a cooling planet, but they did not represent a consensus view from the scientific community. The author cites an admission from the author of a Newsweek article on global cooling that the article was high on enthusiasm but low on supporting science.

In summary, the article disputes the claim that the Time magazine cover from 1977 is evidence of media fearmongering over global cooling. The author argues that the cover was about record-setting cold temperatures and was filed under the subject of weather. The author accuses Time magazine of manufacturing a fake cover and suggests that Snopes and other news organizations adopted this hoax.

855,"### Context: Madagascar is currently facing its largest measles outbreak in history, with cases exceeding 115,000. However, the rise in cases is not due to resistance to vaccinating children, as is the case in some other countries. In the United States and elsewhere, misinformation has led some parents to refuse vaccines, contributing to the increase in measles cases. In response to an outbreak in New York City, mandatory vaccinations have been ordered in one Brooklyn neighborhood. 

In Madagascar, many parents want to protect their children from measles but face significant challenges, including a lack of resources. Only 58% of people on the main island of Madagascar have been vaccinated against measles, which is a major factor in the spread of the outbreak. To prevent outbreaks, immunization rates need to be 90% to 95% or higher. 

The outbreak has primarily affected children under the age of 15 and has resulted in numerous deaths. Nearly 50% of children in Madagascar are malnourished, which complicates the outbreak further. Malnutrition weakens the immune system and makes individuals more susceptible to diseases like measles. 

Accessing healthcare in Madagascar is also a challenge, as many people cannot afford to see a doctor or buy medicine. Health centers are often understaffed or have poorly qualified workers, leading to unreliable information about health issues. Some parents are not aware that vaccines are free in public health centers. 

The symptoms of measles are treated, as there is no specific treatment for the disease. Vitamin A is given to children to boost their immunity, and antibiotics are provided if there is a cough. If the disease is not treated early enough, complications such as diarrhea, bronchitis, pneumonia, and convulsions can occur. 

The Madagascar health ministry has sent free medication to the regions most affected by the outbreak, but there are concerns that it may not be enough. The capital city, Antananarivo, has also been affected by the outbreak. WHO has initiated a mass vaccination campaign in Madagascar, aiming to reach 7.2 million children aged 6 months to 9 years. However, immunization is not the only strategy for combating the epidemic, as resources are also needed for care, monitoring, and social mobilization.

856,"### Context: The claim that Chris Christie advised Donald Trump to provoke Joe Biden into stuttering during the 2020 presidential debates is based on social media posts that attribute quotes to Christie. However, there is no publicly available source for these quotes, and they appear to be paraphrases of an alleged broader debate strategy by the Trump campaign. It is unclear why these quotes were specifically attributed to Christie. 

Earlier news reports cited anonymous sources familiar with Trump's debate preparations, stating that there was tension among his advisers on whether to target Biden's stutter. Some advisers believed it was a calculated risk to phrase things in a way that might cause Biden to stammer, while others were concerned that such a strategy could backfire and appear to be mocking Biden's ability to overcome challenges. 

The Washington Post also reported that Trump had been advised and was keen to make Biden stutter and stammer during the debates. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Christie's involvement in this advice.

Joe Biden has been open about his lifelong struggle to overcome his severe childhood stutter. The claim that Christie advised Trump to provoke Biden's stutter is relevant to Biden's personal experience with stuttering.

In summary, there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that Chris Christie advised Donald Trump to provoke Joe Biden into stuttering during the 2020 presidential debates. The attributed quotes to Christie are not backed by any publicly available source, and they appear to be paraphrases of a broader debate strategy. However, earlier news reports suggest that there was tension among Trump's advisers on whether to target Biden's stutter.

857,"### Context: A study conducted by Alabama Orthopedic Spine & Sports Medicine Associates suggests that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation can lower the risk of re-injury and the need for follow-up surgery. The study examined 121 patients, with 68 experiencing their first dislocation and 53 having recurrent dislocations after non-operative treatment. After treatment with arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury. Additionally, 7% of those with surgery after the initial dislocation required another surgery, compared to 32% after a recurrent dislocation. The study was based on a retrospective chart review and a survey, with limitations in terms of sample size and study design. The news release does not mention the costs associated with surgery or any drawbacks associated with undergoing the procedure. The release also lacks information on the prevalence and impact of shoulder instability, as well as the availability of the surgical intervention and non-operative treatments. It would have been helpful if the release had provided context on the novelty of the surgical intervention and its place in the wider body of research. The release does not engage in disease mongering or make sensational claims, but it does present the study findings in a way that may overstate the benefits of surgery. The study abstract itself does not justify the claim made in the release, as it only states that first-time dislocators had lower postoperative instability rates and reoperation rates compared to patients with recurrent dislocations. The release also presents a conflicting view on treatment decisions, with the lead author implying that medical professionals make the decisions alone, while the agenda paper suggests that young athletes with shoulder instability should be offered early surgical intervention. Overall, the news release provides limited information and could have been strengthened by addressing these limitations and providing more context.
Claim: Treating First Time Shoulder Dislocations with Surgery Can Benefit Young Athletes, Study Shows
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release describes the results of a study presented at an annual meeting showing that athletes who dislocated their shoulders for the first time and underwent surgery had lower rates of postoperative instability and re-operation when compared with patients who had recurrent dislocations before undergoing surgery. It contains lots of numbers, which we applaud. These numbers are important because they add to the limited database available to help guide treatment for athletes who have suffered a shoulder dislocation. As one study put it in 2014, “there is no consensus on the optimal treatment of in-season athletes with anterior shoulder instability, and limited data are available to guide return to play.” But, in stating a causal relationship, the news release goes beyond what the data support. Specifically, the news release says that the study “demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.” The study, which was observational in nature, can only show associations between shoulder surgery and subsequent outcomes — not that surgery after a first-time dislocation was the cause of reduced risks. Also missing from the release: harms, alternative therapies, costs and study limitations. This matters because, in the 2014 prospective study, just 27% of athletes whose shoulders were made unstable due to injury “returned to play and completed the season without subsequent instability.” According to the study abstract, the shoulder is the most common joint dislocation, affecting 2% of the general population, most of them males. And there’s a 50% likelihood of another dislocation after a first one, according to the background into given by the study authors. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, there were some 63 million visits to non-federally employed, office-based physicians specializing in orthopedic surgery in the United States in 2010. Shoulder symptoms ranked among the top four reasons given by patients for visiting orthopedic surgeons.","Treating First Time Shoulder Dislocations with Surgery Can Benefit Young Athletes, Study Shows","This news release describes a study that compared the outcomes of two groups of young athletes who had a first-time shoulder dislocation. One group had surgery, and the other did not. The study found that the group that had surgery had fewer recurrent dislocations and fewer repeat surgeries. The news release does a good job of describing the study and its findings. However, it doesn’t address the limitations of the study, which were significant. The release also doesn’t address costs, which can be substantial. Shoulder dislocations are common in young athletes, and recurrent dislocations can lead to chronic instability and the need for multiple surgeries. A study that shows that early surgery can reduce the risk of recurrent dislocations and the need for repeat surgeries is of interest to athletes, their parents, and their coaches."
858,"### Context: According to the article, when someone with the new coronavirus sneezes, the virus can travel about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne. However, the distance the droplets spread from a sneeze can vary depending on environmental factors, but it is likely to be several meters. 

It is also mentioned that the new coronavirus is not heat-resistant and can be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. While similar viruses may transmit less well in the heat, many countries with reported Covid-19 cases are experiencing temperatures higher than this.

The article states that if the virus drops on a metal surface, it can live for at least 12 hours. Therefore, it is advised to wash hands with bacterial soap if there is contact with any metal surface. The survival time of the virus on surfaces is still unknown, but it may range from hours to days. On fabric, the virus can survive for 6-12 hours, but normal laundry detergent is said to be effective in killing it. There is no evidence yet that the virus can survive in clothing and be transmitted this way, but any soiled clothing should be thoroughly washed.

Drinking warm water is mentioned as an effective measure against all viruses, while avoiding liquids with ice. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the temperature of consumed liquids can protect or cure diseases caused by viruses.

The article suggests washing hands frequently as the virus can only live on hands for 5-10 minutes. However, the exact duration of the virus on the skin is unknown, so regular handwashing is recommended. Gargling with a simple solution of salt in warm water is also mentioned as a preventive measure, but there is no evidence to support its effectiveness against the virus.

Regarding the symptoms of Covid-19, it is stated that the virus first infects the throat, causing a sore throat lasting 3 or 4 days. It then blends into nasal fluid, enters the trachea, and eventually the lungs, leading to pneumonia. This process takes about 5 or 6 days, and with pneumonia comes high fever and difficulty breathing. However, it is noted that not everyone with Covid-19 gets pneumonia, and the symptoms may not occur in this exact order or at these specific times.

859,"### Context: The article discusses the FDA approval of a new drug called Aimovig, which is designed to prevent migraines. The drug is a self-injection that will cost $575 per month or $6,900 annually. The article includes a statement from Amgen, the manufacturer of the drug, claiming that the price reflects the value it brings to patients and society. However, the article does not challenge this claim or provide alternative perspectives.

The article highlights the reduction in headache days achieved by the drug, stating that it reduced the average number of monthly migraine headaches by over 50% for nearly half of the study participants. It also mentions that patients treated with Aimovig were nearly three times more likely to have reduced their migraine days by 50% or more compared to those treated with a placebo. However, the FDA news release provides less positive findings, stating that Aimovig-treated patients experienced, on average, one to two fewer monthly migraine days than those on placebo.

The article fails to provide sufficient information about the evidence for the drug's effectiveness. It does not mention if patients in the placebo groups also received an injection, which is important for evaluating the drug's impact. Additionally, the article does not emphasize the lack of long-term data on the drug's safety and effectiveness. One study included in the drug's approval reported on patients who had taken the drug for six months, while the other two studies reported on patients who had taken it for three months.

The article mentions that there are other treatments available for migraine prevention but notes that they do not work for everyone. It also states that the drug should be covered by health insurance, but it does not mention that Amgen and Novartis have a patient assistance program that can help patients with insurance coverage or reduced costs.

The article quotes a patient who claims to have never had migraines since starting the drug but does not include any quotes from patients who did not benefit from the drug. It also fails to disclose potential conflicts of interest, such as the fact that the lead researcher of the study is an advisor or consultant for Amgen and Novartis.

Overall, the article provides limited information about the drug's effectiveness, safety, and potential coverage by insurance. It does not challenge the claims made by the manufacturer or provide alternative perspectives.

But the story could leave readers thinking the drug works better than it really does, because it only quotes the drug company’s rosy summary, and not what the FDA reported. Millions of Americans suffer from migraine attacks that greatly diminish their quality of life. There is currently no preventive medication with no side effects approved for patients who suffer from chronic or episodic migraines. This new drug has been hyped by Novartis’ and Amgen’s PR machines since clinical trials for them first began. It is important that people with migraines and their family members and friends (who often forward on anything and everything written about products that claim to reduce migraine attacks) are given accurate information about who a new drug is for and the extent to which it can actually improve people’s lives.",FDA approves new drug that prevents migraines without side effects,"This story reports on the FDA’s approval of a new drug for the prevention of migraine headaches.

However, the story fails to provide readers with sufficient information about the evidence for the drug’s effectiveness, and it does not challenge the claims made by the drug’s manufacturer. The story also fails to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Migraine headaches are a common and often disabling condition. The majority of migraine headaches are treated with over-the-counter or prescription pain medications. For those who experience frequent migraine headaches, preventive medications may be prescribed. The most common preventive medications are beta blockers, antiepileptic drugs, and tricyclic antidepressants. These medications are often not effective and can have significant side effects. The development of a new class of drugs for the prevention of migraine headaches is a welcome addition to the treatment options available to patients."
860,"### Context: The article discusses a letter written by Denver District Attorney Mitchell Morrissey, which claims that the legalization of marijuana in Colorado has led to an increase in crime and fatalities. The letter, published by the Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana (CALM) political action committee, urges California voters to reject Proposition 64, which would legalize recreational marijuana use for adults.

Morrissey's argument is based on statistics from a report by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Traffic Area (HIDTA), which states that ""traffic related marijuana deaths"" increased by 48 percent and ""marijuana related emergency room visits"" increased by 49 percent after marijuana was legalized in Colorado. However, the report includes qualifiers that are not mentioned in Morrissey's letter, such as the fact that driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) could include alcohol in combination with drugs. The report also states that the presence of marijuana in toxicology reports does not necessarily prove that marijuana was the cause of the incident.

The letter also cites statistics from the Colorado Bureau of Investigations' statewide crime report for 2015, which notes a 14.7 percent increase in homicides compared to the previous year. However, the report does not mention marijuana as a factor. Local police in Pueblo attribute the increase in homicides to lower staff levels and an increase in the use of opioids like black-tar heroin, not marijuana legalization. Similarly, while the homicide rate in Aurora doubled between 2014 and 2015, other factors such as a higher population and low police staffing were also cited as contributing to the crime increase.

Morrissey denies writing the letter for political reasons and claims to be presenting the facts regarding the effects of marijuana legalization. However, in a previous statement, he claimed that there were 12 homicides directly related to medical marijuana and over 100 aggravated robberies and home invasions. He later backed away from these claims, stating that they were based on ""loose figures.""

Overall, the article suggests that the claim that marijuana legalization has led to an increase in crime and fatalities all over Colorado is not supported by the evidence presented in Morrissey's letter. The statistics cited in the letter have qualifiers that are not mentioned, and other factors such as population growth and low police staffing may have contributed to the increase in crime.

The claim originated from a chain email that has been circulating since 2009 and has been misinterpreted and exaggerated. The email attributes the information to Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas, but he has disowned it and stated that it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law in March 2010, does not include any provisions for age-based rationing of cancer care.

862,"### Context: The article discusses the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines to treat sleep apnea, a condition where breathing stops during sleep. The article mentions that the costs associated with CPAP technology and sleep lab evaluation are not discussed, and there is no mention of insurance coverage for these approaches. The benefits of using CPAP machines are described in general terms, such as improved sleep and reduced snoring, but there is no information on the size of the benefits, their reproducibility, or the time needed to see results.

The article includes a description of the CPAP machine, comparing it to Darth Vader on life support, to give readers an idea of what the device looks like. It also mentions that there are over 12 million people affected by sleep apnea, but most of them are undiagnosed. The article includes quotes from three healthcare providers in the field of sleep medicine, as well as testimonials from individuals who have benefited from using CPAP.

While the article discusses lifestyle changes, weight reduction, and surgery as alternative methods to manage sleep apnea, it does not mention that CPAP devices are FDA approved for the treatment of sleep apnea. However, it does state that CPAP is a readily available treatment.

The article acknowledges that CPAP is not a new treatment and has been in use since the 1980s, initially for neonates and later for adults with sleep apnea. It does not provide evidence that the story relied solely or largely on a news release.

Overall, the article focuses on the use of CPAP machines to treat sleep apnea, but lacks information on costs, insurance coverage, and specific evidence supporting the claimed benefits. It also mentions alternative treatment methods and the availability of CPAP as a treatment option.

863,"### Context: A new gene test has been developed that could potentially save women with breast cancer from unnecessary radiation therapy. The existing version of the test costs over $4,000, but it could save women money if the results prompt them to skip radiation therapy, which can cost over $21,000 and expose them to risks and harms. The new test puts 75 percent of women with a certain type of breast tumor into a low-risk category, which could support a decision to skip radiation therapy. The predictions of the test are more accurate than what clinicians currently rely on. However, the study did not examine whether the test actually improves outcomes for patients, so further trials would be needed to determine if changing treatment based on the test results improves long-term health outcomes. The story does mention that more study is needed before making changes in usual treatment recommendations. The test is intended for the 45,000 women in the United States who are diagnosed each year with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in one of their breasts. The study found that 5 percent of women classified as ""low-risk"" still developed an invasive cancer within 10 years, while over 80 percent of women labeled as ""high-risk"" did not develop an invasive breast cancer within 10 years. The story does a good job of describing the study and putting the results in context, but it fails to clearly alert readers to the fact that the study did not look at the effect of changing treatment recommendations based on the test results. The story also mentions that the test is a refinement of an existing test and that the company plans to make the new version available within weeks. The article does not rely on a news release and includes comments from independent experts.
Claim: Gene test could spare women from unnecessary radiation
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Women diagnosed with small breast tumors known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often have to make treatment decisions (including whether to add radiation therapy after surgery) without being certain about how much risk of a recurrence they really face. This story reports the results of a study that compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in a group of women. The story provides multiple views and useful context. However, most readers would likely assume that treatment decisions that incorporate these test results would offer better health outcomes. This story should have clearly stated that this study was not designed to answer that important question and that follow-up trials will be need to document the health effects of using this test. Predicting risk is one thing. Knowing which treatment is most likely to produce the best outcome for a patient with a certain risk level is a different question. People often confuse the two; so news reports about risk assessment should take special care to point out that improving the ability to predict a patient’s future does not necessarily mean that you can change that future. Eric Winer’s cautious comment was an important part of the story – “he’d like to see additional studies before using the test to advise patients.”",Gene test could spare women from unnecessary radiation,"This is a story about a new test that could help women with a common form of breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), avoid radiation therapy. The story does a good job of describing the study and putting the results in context. The story also does a good job of describing the harms of radiation therapy. However, the story fails to clearly alert readers to the fact that the study did not look at the effect of changing treatment recommendations based on the test results. The story also does not mention that the study was funded by the company that makes the test. The story does a good job of describing the test and putting the results in context.

864,"### Context: A recent study suggests that high doses of vitamin D3 may help alleviate menstrual cramps. The study involved 40 women with moderate to severe menstrual pain, who were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose of 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 or a placebo. The women in the vitamin D group experienced a 41% reduction in pain, while the control group did not experience any pain reduction. However, it is unclear what the 41% reduction is in reference to and whether it was significant enough for women to resume their normal activities.

The article does not mention any potential harms associated with high doses of vitamin D, but it does note that the women in the study already had low levels of vitamin D. It is unclear if lower doses of vitamin D would have been equally beneficial. The study only followed up with the participants for two months and did not provide information on long-term effects. The article also emphasizes the need for larger clinical trials to confirm these findings.

The story mentions that vitamin D supplements would be comparable in cost to NSAIDs or birth control pills, but it does not provide specific cost information. It also discusses other alternatives for alleviating menstrual cramps, such as NSAIDs and birth control pills, but could have provided more information on this point.

The article points out that the high dose of vitamin D used in the study is only available by prescription, while lower doses are available over the counter. It compares the 300,000 IU dose to a typical replacement dose of 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks. The story does not claim that this research is novel, but it does mention that using vitamin D at this dosage for menstrual cramps is a novel approach.

The story includes interviews with doctors not associated with the study, who provide their viewpoints on the findings. Overall, the article acknowledges some limitations of the study and the need for further research, but it does not solely rely on a press release.
Claim: Vitamin D3 Might Ease Menstrual Cramps
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"We wished for more on benefits, harms, and on context about the dose used in the study. See our comments on those criteria below. Most women experience some sort of menstrual cramps and only rarely are the instances of these cramps debilitating. This study, done in a sample of women with already low levels of Vitamin D and with a dosage beyond that recommended or available to most women, provides at best preliminary evidence that Vitamin D at 300,000 IU was the main reason for the decrease in pain.",Vitamin D3 Might Ease Menstrual Cramps,"This is a story about a small study that found that a single, high dose of vitamin D3 may help alleviate menstrual cramps. The story does a good job of describing the study and its limitations. It also does a good job of putting the findings in context and providing some good alternative treatments. The story could have been improved by providing more information on the potential harms of taking high doses of vitamin D and by providing more information on the cost of vitamin D supplements. The story also could have been improved by providing more information on the pain reduction that was seen in the study."

867,"### Context: A jury has awarded over $70 million to a woman in a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson over claims that their baby powder caused her ovarian cancer. The trial began on September 26 and the jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Deborah Giannecchini of Modesto, California. The lawsuit accused Johnson & Johnson of ""negligent conduct"" in the making and marketing of their baby powder. This verdict reaffirms the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public about the ovarian cancer risk associated with their product. Johnson & Johnson plans to appeal the verdict, stating that they are guided by the science which supports the safety of their baby powder.

Earlier this year, two other lawsuits in St. Louis resulted in jury verdicts worth a combined $127 million. However, two other lawsuits in New Jersey were dismissed by a judge due to lack of reliable evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer, accounting for about 22,000 of the 1.7 million new cancer cases expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. this year. Around 2,000 women have filed similar lawsuits, and lawyers are reviewing thousands of other potential cases.

Research on the link between ovarian cancer and the use of baby powder for feminine hygiene has produced mixed results. While some studies have found no link or a weak one, other research has connected talcum powder to ovarian cancer since the 1970s. Case studies have indicated that women who regularly use talc on their genital area face up to a 40 percent higher risk of developing ovarian cancer. Johnson & Johnson has been accused of marketing their baby powder towards overweight women, blacks, and Hispanics, who are at higher risk for ovarian cancer.

Talc, the main ingredient in baby powder, is a mineral that is mined from deposits around the world. It has been widely used in cosmetics and personal care products since the late 1800s. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies genital use of talc as ""possibly carcinogenic,"" while the National Toxicology Program has not fully reviewed talc.

This is not the first time Johnson & Johnson has faced criticism over the ingredients in their products. In 2012, the company agreed to remove probable carcinogens from all their products.

870,"### Context: Taiwan has implemented a successful approach to controlling the spread of the coronavirus, which has earned praise from leaders around the world. The country has been able to avoid a large outbreak, with only 267 cases so far. Taiwan's strategy includes early controls on Chinese visitors, vigorous contact tracing, technology, and stringent 14-day quarantines for all arrivals. Those who follow the rules are rewarded with a stipend and goodie bags that contain items like masks, instant noodles, and free packages for online gaming and movie services.

However, Taiwan is now facing an increase in imported cases and local outbreaks with no clear source of infection. The government is currently in a crucial two-week period to control the virus as tens of thousands of Taiwanese return home from countries with high case numbers. Health workers are concerned that the system could be overwhelmed if cases spike in the coming weeks.

Some politicians have called for stricter measures, including an emergency order forbidding foreign travel. There are concerns that Taiwan is not conducting widespread testing like South Korea and other countries, leading to speculation that there may be more cases than reported. However, the government argues that widespread testing is unnecessary as they have been able to trace almost all cases and their contacts.

Taiwan's quarantine system has been effective, with 86,000 people currently in quarantine. The government has imposed large fines for breaking the rules and has threatened to name and shame quarantine breakers. They have also implemented an ""electronic fence"" using mobile phones to track those in home quarantines.

To encourage compliance with the quarantine program, the government has rolled out incentives. Taiwanese citizens can order up to three masks a week online and pick them up from convenience stores. They have also received ""care bags"" containing essential items. Additionally, those quarantined at home receive a daily subsidy of T$1,000, although it is withheld from those who traveled abroad against government advice.

Overall, Taiwan's carrot-and-stick approach to fighting the virus has been successful in controlling the outbreak. However, the country is facing challenges with imported cases and local outbreaks, and there are concerns about the capacity of the healthcare system if cases increase significantly.

871,"### Context: The article discusses the benefits of an anti-gravity treadmill called the AlterG, which is designed to help people recover from injuries, surgery, and other walking and running problems. The device uses air pressure to reduce the user's body weight, allowing them to exercise with less impact and stress on their joints. The article mentions that the treadmill costs $25,000 but does not provide information on the typical cost of therapy sessions or whether health insurance covers the use of the device.

The article includes quotes from users and a trainer who praise the device, but there is no evidence provided to support these claims. The article also fails to mention any potential harms or compare the device to other rehabilitation techniques. It does not address how much faster users recover or if they walk or run better compared to alternative methods.

The research touted by the company does not address whether the AlterG is more effective than other rehabilitation techniques. The company's website includes clinical reports that measure biomechanical forces on users but do not provide evidence of healing or functional advantages. The article also highlights a review article that mentions the AlterG as one example of available rehabilitation devices but does not specifically endorse its effectiveness.

The article fails to disclose the ties between the people quoted in the story and the company that sells the device. For example, a trainer mentioned in the article has coordinated marketing efforts with AlterG, and an elite distance runner has appeared in the company's marketing materials and received free use of the device.

The article also neglects to mention alternative methods of partial weight support during rehabilitation, such as exercising in a swimming pool or using treadmills with harnesses. It notes that the AlterG treadmill is available at a limited number of rehabilitation centers but does not provide context or comparison with other methods.

Overall, the article lacks critical information and evidence to support the claims made about the AlterG treadmill. It fails to address important questions about cost, effectiveness, potential harms, and alternative methods of rehabilitation. The article also does not disclose the potential biases of the people quoted in the story.
Claim: Anti-Gravity Treadmill helps injured get moving again
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The story doesn’t compare the new gee-whiz technology to alternatives, such as exercising in a swimming pool – leading oneline news reader to comment, “You can do the same thing in any swimming pool and get a better workout.” The story misrepresents the available research evidence. It is vague about benefits and silent about potential harms. It mentions cost, but not in a way that is useful to readers. The story invokes the NASA-linked origins of the concept underlying the Alter-G device, but it is like a report that extols the wonders of Tang without acknowledging the existence of orange juice.

The story also fails to disclose that two of the people quoted in the story have ties to the company that sells the device. The story does a disservice to readers by not providing them with any critical information about the device."

874,"### Context: A recent study suggests that aspirin may reduce the risk of cancer, but caution is urged when interpreting the results. The study found that participants who took aspirin had a 23% reduction in cancer incidence compared to those who did not take aspirin. However, the absolute reduction was only 0.7%, meaning that 150 people would need to be treated with aspirin to prevent one occurrence of cancer. The article emphasizes the importance of considering the costs and side effects of aspirin, such as bleeding ulcers, when making population-wide recommendations. The story also highlights the limitations of the study, including the fact that it relied on data from experiments designed to study heart disease, not cancer. The study included very few women, and there may be other factors that were not recorded during the original trials that could affect the results. The article includes comments from independent sources and current guidelines that do not recommend using aspirin to reduce cancer risk. It also mentions that some of the authors of the study have been paid consultants to pharmaceutical companies. The article recommends maintaining a healthy body weight and not smoking as ways to prevent cancer, in addition to cautioning against relying solely on aspirin. The availability of aspirin is well-known, but the article suggests that stories about aspirin should clearly distinguish between uses that are supported by evidence and those that require further evaluation. The article concludes by noting that this study adds to previous research on the potential cancer-related effects of aspirin and that it does not appear to rely on a news release. Overall, the article provides a balanced view of the study's findings and highlights the uncertainties and limitations associated with using aspirin to reduce cancer risk.
Claim: Aspirin may cut cancer deaths, but caution urged
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"From the appropriate title to the last precautionary sentence, this story provides the readers with a balanced perspective and places the study into context. This story gives readers key facts and a range of expert reactions and context about a study that re-analyzed heart disease prevention experiments and saw lower rates of cancer deaths among trial participants who had been assigned to take daily low-dose aspirin. Readers are clearly told that while this study provides new insight, there are some key questions that need to be answered before many experts would change their recommendations about aspirin. The only important shortcoming is that it reports only the relative risk reductions without also telling readers about the absolute differences in cancer death rates that the researchers observed. Cancers of all types are second only to heart disease as the cause of death in developed countries. A number of observational studies have suggested that the kind of low-dose aspirin regimen recommended for some people at risk of heart disease may also have some cancer-related benefits. This study attempts to avoid some of the inherent limitations of observational studies by using data that was collected as part of experimental trials that randomized people to take aspirin or a placebo pill. It is important that stories explain both the advantages and limitations of this kind of data analysis.","Aspirin may cut cancer deaths, but caution urged",This is a story about a study that found that aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of developing cancer. The story does a good job of describing the study and its limitations. It also does a good job of describing the potential harms of aspirin use. The story would have been stronger if it had included more independent sources and if it had described the costs of aspirin use. The story also could have been improved by making it clearer that the study was not designed to test the hypothesis that aspirin reduces cancer risk.

875,"### Context: A proposed bill in California aims to create price controls for healthcare services, which has faced opposition from the health care industry. The bill would establish a nine-member commission to set prices for various medical procedures and services, affecting private health plans including those offered by employers and purchased by individuals. The proposal is supported by influential unions who are concerned about rising health care costs eating into employee compensation. However, health care providers argue that price controls would lead to doctors leaving the state, making it harder for people to access medical care, and could result in layoffs or closures of hospitals. The California Medical Association called the proposal ""radical"" and warned that it would limit choices for consumers. Under the bill, prices would be tied to Medicare's rates, with a process for doctors or hospitals to argue for higher payments based on unique circumstances. Critics argue that the bill does not address the financial gap created by Medicare and Medicaid, as private insurers make up for the low payments from government-funded health care. The rising costs of health care in the US have led to increased premiums, deductibles, and copays for consumers, while industry consolidation has given players more power to demand higher rates. The proposal in California comes amid a larger debate in the state about government-funded insurance for all residents. The bill faces challenges in the Legislature, where lawmakers are cautious about making significant changes to the health care system and are already considering other ambitious proposals.
Claim: California bill would create health care price controls.

876,"### Context: The claim that Bill and Melinda Gates' polio vaccination efforts in India paralyzed 47,500 children is false. The claim originated from an editorial in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, which argued that the increase in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in India was directly proportional to the doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) administered. However, research conducted by the Indian Institute of Science and the World Health Organization found that the increase in AFP cases was due to a broadened definition of AFP and improved surveillance and detection methods, rather than the polio vaccine itself.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributes technical and financial resources to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to support targeted vaccination campaigns, community mobilization, and routine immunization efforts. The GPEI's strategy aims to reach all children in high-risk countries with multiple doses of OPV. The oral polio vaccine is considered safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. While it can cause paralysis in very rare cases, the risk is extremely low (1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine).

The eRumor's central claim is based on an editorial that argued for dropping disease-specific projects in favor of community-oriented primary health care programs. However, the research conducted by the Indian Institute of Science and the World Health Organization does not support the claim that the polio vaccination campaign caused paralysis in 47,500 children. The increase in AFP cases in India was attributed to the expanded definition of AFP and improved surveillance methods.

In conclusion, the claim that Bill and Melinda Gates' polio vaccination efforts in India paralyzed 47,500 children is false. The increase in cases of non-polio AFP in India was not directly caused by the polio vaccine, but rather due to a broadened definition of AFP and improved surveillance methods. The oral polio vaccine is considered safe and effective, with a very low risk of causing paralysis.

877,"### Context: The article discusses an advertising campaign by the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) that targets higher energy taxes. The campaign claims that proposed tax changes by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress would amount to a ""handout"" to companies like BP. The two changes under consideration are the rules for ""dual capacity"" taxpayers and the elimination of oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199 of the tax code.

The ""dual capacity"" rule deals with a tax code provision that allows U.S. taxpayers to receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas. The rule becomes complicated when foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both tax and a payment for the right to drill. The ad argues that the proposed changes would primarily affect oil and gas companies and could be seen as a ""handout"" to foreign companies like BP.

The second proposal is to eliminate oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199, which is a deduction for companies that produce goods or undertake construction projects in the U.S. The ad claims that these changes could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices, and greater dependence on foreign oil.

The article questions the accuracy of the ad's claim that these changes would be a ""handout"" to BP. It argues that while the changes would take away benefits from U.S.-based oil and gas companies, it is not clear that this would directly benefit BP or other foreign companies. The article also highlights that foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, weakening the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made.

Overall, the article suggests that the term ""handout"" used in the ad is questionable and potentially misleading. It acknowledges that the proposed changes would affect U.S.-based oil and gas companies but questions whether this directly benefits foreign companies like BP.

However, this claim is not supported by evidence. The World Health Organization has listed lemon and turmeric, as well as oranges and cayenne, as unproven cures for COVID-19. Mucus actually serves as the body's defense against virus microbes, and there is no evidence that clearing out the sinuses can prevent or cure COVID-19. The recommended treatments for COVID-19 include cough medicine, pain relievers, rest, and fluids to alleviate symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Therefore, boiling orange peels with cayenne pepper and inhaling the steam will not protect against COVID-19 or cure the illness.

879,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Ed Garvey, a long-time Democratic activist, that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is planning to push legislation that would allow the state to declare financial martial law and take over municipal governments. Garvey first made this claim in a blog post and has repeated it in subsequent interviews and postings. The article examines the evidence provided by Garvey to support his claim.

Garvey claims that he discovered a secret plan being prepared by the state's largest law firm, Foley & Lardner, for the Greater Milwaukee Committee, the Bradley Foundation, the governor, and key legislators. However, a closer look at the evidence shows that it is not as Machiavellian as Garvey claims. The evidence Garvey discovered is a recently launched website called Makeityourmilwaukeecounty.com, which is the online version of a project launched by a Greater Milwaukee Committee task force. The task force's recommendations, including the development of a statewide fiscal stress test, were made public in February. The website explicitly states that the group does not support a ""martial law"" style approach.

The article also mentions that some heavy-hitters, including lobbyists with Foley & Lardner, former state legislator Mary Panzer, and public relations firm Mueller Communications, are working with the Greater Milwaukee Committee to build support for the recommendations and turn them into legislation. The Greater Milwaukee Committee is chaired by Michael Grebe, who was Walker's campaign chairman and led the governor's transition team. However, Walker has denied any involvement with the plan being discussed.

The article concludes that while Garvey believes Walker is involved, he has not provided any direct evidence to support his claim. The Greater Milwaukee Committee's proposal is focused on creating a ""good-government"" style website to allow citizens to compare and contrast the health of local government finances, not a Michigan-style approach. The article suggests that Garvey's claim is more of a gardening scoop than a journalistic one.

In summary, the article examines the claim made by Ed Garvey that Governor Scott Walker is planning to push legislation allowing the state to declare financial martial law and take over municipal governments. The article finds that Garvey's evidence is not as strong as he claims and that the Greater Milwaukee Committee's proposal is focused on a different approach. Governor Walker has denied any involvement with the plan.

880,"### Context: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reached agreements with four companies, L’Occitane, Sensa Products, HCG Diet Direct, and LeanSpa, to drop unsubstantiated weight-loss claims from their advertisements and, in some cases, return money to consumers. The FTC also urged media outlets to be more careful in scrutinizing advertisements to avoid publishing potentially misleading ads. The FTC’s action, called “Operation Failed Resolution,” was timed to coincide with the common New Year's resolutions to lose weight. Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, warned that weight-loss resolutions are hard to keep and that the chances of success with products like food supplements and skin creams are slim to none.

One of the agreements was with Sensa, a company that claimed its powder sprinkled on food would cause weight loss. The company advertised the product on television infomercials, magazine advertisements, and online ads, stating that the powder was clinically proven to cause substantial weight loss without dieting or exercise. However, a study conducted by a Sensa company executive found that users only lost an average of 5.6 pounds over six months. Sensa agreed to return $26.5 million to consumers.

L’Occitane, another company, sold two skin creams that promised clinically proven slimming effectiveness and the reduction of cellulite. However, the FTC found no evidence to support these claims, and L’Occitane agreed to pay $450,000 to reimburse customers.

HCG Diet Direct sold liquid drops containing a hormone produced by human placenta that it claimed would help people lose weight. The company agreed to pay $3.2 million under a settlement, although the judgment was suspended due to the company's inability to pay.

LeanSpa, which used fake news websites to advertise the acai berry as a weight-loss miracle product, reached a settlement with the FTC. Boris Mizhen, a LeanSpa executive, will surrender $7 million in cash and property, while his wife will surrender $300,000.

Overall, the FTC's actions aim to combat misleading weight-loss claims made by these companies and encourage media outlets to be more cautious in publishing such advertisements.

881,"### Context: The article debunks several claims made in a meme about Nancy Pelosi and her family. The first claim is about Nancy Pelosi's father, Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., being a constant companion of Benjamin ""Benny Tratta"" Magliano, a Boston mobster. The claim is based on a blog post by Phillip Crawford, Jr., but the allegations were never officially corroborated and no charges were brought against D'Alesandro.

The second claim is that Nancy Pelosi owns Goat Hill Pizza, a restaurant suspected of harboring trafficking. This claim is false. Pelosi does not own a pizza parlor, and Goat Hill Pizza is not suspected of harboring child trafficking by any law enforcement agencies. The claim originated from a filing error in a document that listed an email address associated with Pelosi.

The third claim is that Pelosi held a secret fundraiser for Islamist and Hamas-linked groups. While Pelosi did attend a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee where Nihad Awad, the co-founder of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), was present, CAIR was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 2007 trial but was not charged with any criminal activity. The claim is a mixture of truth and misinformation.

The fourth claim is that Nancy Pelosi's son, Paul Pelosi, Jr., was charged with securities fraud. While Paul Pelosi, Jr. did work for a company called Natural Blue Resources Inc., he was not one of the individuals charged with securities fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC charged four individuals involved with the company, but Paul Pelosi, Jr. was not mentioned in the charges.

The fifth claim is that Nancy Pelosi's brother, Franklin D. Roosevelt D'Alesandro, was charged with lying during a rape trial. Franklin D'Alesandro was charged with perjury during a rape trial in the 1950s but was eventually acquitted of those charges.

The final claim is about Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, having a net worth of over $200 million. While Paul Pelosi is a successful businessman and investor, the claim that he has a net worth of $202 million is unproven. The figure mentioned in the claim refers to the estimated value of Pelosi's assets, not his net worth, and does not take into account other financial aspects such as debt.

Overall, the article concludes that the claims made in the meme about the ""Pelosi Crime Family"" are largely overstated, misrepresented, or based on unreliable information.

882,"### Context: Texas agriculture commissioner Sid Miller claimed that a poll showed that 70 to 75 percent of people want Confederate statues to remain in place. However, a fact-checking investigation found that most national polls actually show more Americans in opposition to removing such statues than in favor. The Huffington Post conducted a poll in August 2017, which found that 33 percent of respondents favored removing the statues, 48 percent were opposed, and 18 percent were unsure. The Marist Poll, conducted in collaboration with NPR and the PBS NewsHour, found that 62 percent of respondents believed the statues should remain, 27 percent said they should be removed, and 11 percent were unsure. The Public Policy Polling survey showed that 39 percent of respondents supported Confederate monuments, while 34 percent opposed them. However, 58 percent of respondents supported relocating the monuments to museums or other historic sites. Overall, the majority of polls indicated that slightly more than 50 percent to 54 percent of respondents were opposed to removing Confederate statues. The Marist poll, which Miller referenced, was the only one that showed more than 60 percent in opposition. Therefore, Miller's claim that 70 to 75 percent of people want Confederate statues to remain is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.

883,"### Context: The article discusses an undercover video shot at a women's health clinic in the Bronx in 2013 by the pro-life group Live Action. The video resurfaced in February 2019 and gained attention before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Live Action's founder, Lila Rose, posted a tweet containing the video clip, claiming that the clinic worker advised a woman to put a born-alive baby in a jar of solution to drown her or flush the baby down the toilet or put it in a bag if she's born alive.

The article analyzes the video and states that the specific claim made by Live Action is highly questionable. The employee at the clinic was misinformed or confused about certain clinical matters relating to abortion. The article also mentions that the clinic's designated counselor, shown later in the video, strongly indicates that the clinic has a clear policy of attempting to resuscitate and revive a fetus in the unlikely event that it survives an abortion.

The video shows a woman posing as an abortion-seeker at the Bronx center. She speaks to several staff members, including an employee responsible for going over the medical history of patients. The employee explains the two-day procedure recommended for the woman, known as dilation and evacuation. The woman asks what would happen if the fetus came out in one piece after being removed during the evacuation phase. The employee initially says they've never had that happen, but later says that if it did come out in one piece, it would be placed in a jar of solution and sent to the lab.

The article highlights that the employee's statements are ambiguous and open to interpretation. It's not clear if the employee understood the fetus to be alive and viable in the scenario described by the undercover activist. The employee also gives contradictory descriptions of the purpose of the solution, making it difficult to determine her intended meaning.

Later in the video, the undercover activist speaks to the clinic's designated counselor, who explains the policy of attempting to resuscitate and revive a fetus if it survives the abortion. The counselor clarifies that the doctor cannot perform a termination once the fetus is outside of the body and must send it to the hospital.

Overall, the article concludes that the employee's remarks are not objectively clear in their meaning or intended meaning. The claims made by Live Action and LifeNews.com about the employee instructing the disposal of a living, viable baby are unproven. It is also noted that the counselor in the video clearly outlines the clinic's policy of attempting to resuscitate and revive a fetus in the unlikely event of survival.

Keytruda has proved highly effective in fighting non-small cell lung cancer in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. The average cost of a course of treatment in Britain is around 29,000 pounds ($36,500) at the full list price but the National Health Service will pay less after getting a confidential discount.

885,"### Context: A new study conducted at Toronto General Hospital is testing a technique to flush out and inactivate the hepatitis C virus from donor lungs before a transplant. The research is in response to the spike in available organs contaminated by hepatitis C due to the opioid overdose crisis. Currently, 97% of people waiting for a lung transplant in the United States are unwilling to accept an organ from a donor who tests positive for hepatitis C. The technique used in Toronto, called ex vivo lung perfusion, keeps organs ""alive"" outside the body by pumping them with a bloodless oxygenated liquid. The researchers used ultraviolet C light to irradiate the solution, aiming to deactivate the hepatitis C virus. The study of 22 patients had mixed results, with light therapy significantly decreasing the amount of virus, but all but two patients contracting hepatitis C. However, all infected patients were treated with antiviral drugs and the virus became undetectable in all of them. The researchers are planning another study combining perfusion with a photodynamic therapy, which they believe could be more effective against the virus. In the United States, almost 113,000 people are on organ transplant lists, including over 1,400 awaiting a new lung. With the increase in deaths from opioids, overdose victims now account for 13% of U.S. organ donations, but many of those organs are going to waste. Other researchers are also working with perfusion technology to improve the function of donated organs. For example, scientists at the University of Oxford were able to improve the quality of donated livers with signs of fatty liver disease by treating them outside the body with drugs. The use of perfusion devices is currently limited by cost and lack of expertise and training. The Toronto researchers' technique could simplify the transplant procedure for patients and significantly reduce wasted donor organs.

886,"### Context: Buffalo Sabres forward Kyle Okposo has announced that he is healthy and ready to play again after suffering a concussion that put him in the Neuro Surgical ICU at Buffalo General Hospital. Okposo had missed the final few weeks of the Sabres' season with an undisclosed illness. In a letter posted on the team's website, Okposo revealed that a routine hit in practice caused his mood to change and led to other problems that required hospitalization. He experienced a loss of appetite, had a negative reaction to sleep medications, and at one point weighed less than his playing weight of 218 pounds. 

Okposo stated that he spent time in the ICU to stabilize his condition and that he is now feeling great. He played in a 4-on-4 summer league game in Minnesota with other NHL players and reported no issues. The team's new general manager, Jason Botterill, confirmed that Okposo is on track to be ready for training camp. 

Okposo expressed confidence in his ability to play hockey again, stating that he has worked with concussion experts and people who have dealt with concussions themselves. He believes that he can play without worrying about hitting his head, which he considers a major hurdle for someone who has experienced a concussion. He emphasized that if he did not feel 100 percent right now, he would not be making this statement. 

Okposo's last NHL game was on March 27 against the Florida Panthers. He had 19 goals and 26 assists for a total of 45 points in 65 games during his first season with the Sabres. Okposo signed a seven-year, $42 million contract with the team last summer.

888,"### Context: The article criticizes a news release that claims golf has numerous health benefits. The release states that golfers are typically well-off and that the sport is often seen as expensive and not accessible to lower-income individuals. The cost to play 18 holes at a local course is $27, while at St. Andrews Royal and Ancient Golf Club in Scotland, it is roughly 10 times that amount. The release claims that playing golf regularly is associated with longevity, reducing the risk factors for heart disease and stroke, and boosting strength and balance in older people. However, no data is provided to support these health claims, except for mentioning an increased risk of skin cancer. The article also points out that the release fails to mention the musculoskeletal injuries that can result from swinging a golf club. The study behind the release is based on a modified Delphi method involving 25 experts, but their qualifications are not provided. The Delphi method is subjective and lacks established guidelines, and its consensus does not equate to causation. The release does not disclose that it was funded by the World Golf Foundation, and two of the authors have financial ties to the European Golf Tour and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. The article argues that the benefits touted in the release could also be achieved through activities like walking or hiking, which are more accessible and affordable for many people. Overall, the article criticizes the release for lacking supporting evidence and promoting golf without justification.
Claim: Too many people missing out on health benefits of golf, says expert panel
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release touting the health benefits of golf overreaches and employs unjustified language in summarizing the consensus statement of 25 experts who used questionnaires to agree upon “how best to maximize [golf’s] health benefits, promote [its] sustainability, and widen participation.” There is no original research here. The methodology used to reach a subjective consensus is fraught with major limitations which preclude making health recommendations. The news release fails to mention the entire process was funded by the World Golf Foundation, and some of the authors have other notable financial conflicts of interest within the golf industry. If a news release is going to make claims of evidence showing wide-ranging health benefits related to both physical and mental health — as well as longevity — it had best back that up with real evidence. Furthermore, when there is no original research involved, and the conflicts of interest are substantial, use of the term “evidence” is grossly misleading.

889,"### Context: The article discusses the issue of government bailouts for industries during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on airlines and cruise companies. It highlights public sentiment against providing economic assistance to these industries due to their past financial decisions. The big four airlines (American, United, Delta, and Southwest) accumulated $166 billion in liabilities while spending $39 billion on share repurchases instead of paying off debts. The three largest cruise companies (Carnival, Norwegian, and Royal Caribbean) have $47.5 billion in liabilities and engaged in share repurchases of $8 billion. The article argues that if these companies had paid down their debts instead of buying back stocks, they would have been better prepared to face the current crisis.

The article also mentions the high compensation received by top executives in the airlines and cruise companies. Over a five-year period, airline executives received $666 million in compensation, while cruise executives received $448 million. The article criticizes the fact that taxpayers are now being asked to bail out these companies for their irresponsible behavior.

Another point raised in the article is the foreign registration of cruise ships. It states that nearly all ships operated by U.S.-headquartered cruise lines are registered in foreign countries. Only one major cruise ship at the time of the report was U.S.-flagged, while the rest flew flags from countries like the Bahamas, Panama, Malta, and the Netherlands. The article mentions that cruise lines and their critics have different reasons for this practice. Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) argues that flag selection is based on factors such as the capabilities of the flag, representation and reputation in the shipping community, and fees/charges and taxes. However, some argue that cruise companies register their ships in foreign countries to avoid U.S. regulations, taxes, labor and safety laws, environmental laws, lawsuits, and criminal investigations.

In summary, the article discusses the public sentiment against government bailouts for airlines and cruise companies due to their past financial decisions. It highlights the accumulation of liabilities and share repurchases by these companies instead of paying off debts. The article also mentions the high compensation received by top executives. Additionally, it addresses the foreign registration of cruise ships and the differing reasons given by cruise lines and their critics for this practice.

890,"### Context: The claim that the Massachusetts health care plan is ""wildly unpopular"" among state residents is not supported by available polling data. In a poll conducted by Suffolk University, 38 percent of respondents said that health care in Massachusetts is working, while 49 percent said it is not, and 13 percent were undecided. However, this question was phrased more broadly than the claim, as it referred to ""health care in Massachusetts"" in general, which could include factors beyond the state health plan. Another survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that 59 percent of respondents supported the Massachusetts Universal Health Insurance Law, while 28 percent opposed it, and 13 percent were unsure. When asked if the law should be repealed, continued as is, or continued with changes, 11 percent said it should be repealed, 22 percent said it should continue as is, and 57 percent said it should continue with changes. Although this poll was taken a year and a half ago, it directly addresses the claim and indicates that it is unfounded. A customer satisfaction survey commissioned by the government agency that runs the state health insurance exchange found that 84 percent of participants in the Commonwealth Care program rated it highly satisfactory, while only 4 percent were dissatisfied. However, this survey was not conducted among all Massachusetts residents and is not a valid yardstick for assessing the claim. It is important to note that only about 6 percent of Massachusetts residents have secured health coverage as a direct result of the law, and the impact of the law has been indirect for the majority of residents. While there may be concerns about rising health care costs and potential pressure on primary care physicians, there is no organized opposition to the law in Massachusetts. Additional data from the Harvard poll shows that a majority or plurality of respondents believe the law is not having a significant impact on the quality of their health care, the cost of their health care, or their ability to pay medical bills. Overall, the available polling data contradicts the claim that the Massachusetts health care plan is ""wildly unpopular"" among state residents.

The masks were part of the EU's efforts to tackle the COVID-19 crisis and were purchased from a Chinese provider via an EU fund. However, after receiving a batch of 1.5 million masks, Poland's health minister discovered that the masks did not have European certificates and did not comply with the required medical standards. As a result, Poland decided to suspend future deliveries of these masks.

The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, has stated that it followed all control measures when purchasing the masks and verified their usability. However, the Commission has acknowledged that there may be a quality problem with the masks and has alerted other member states, such as the Netherlands, to similar issues. The Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides, has asked countries that have already received masks to provide feedback on their quality.

The Commission emphasized the importance of high-quality personal protective equipment (PPE) in the fight against COVID-19. The masks are used by citizens and healthcare professionals, making it crucial that they meet the necessary standards. The Commission has stated that it will take any necessary legal action if required.

Kai’s death marks the fourth death at the facility since it opened in October 2016, and it comes just a month after Khloe, an 11-year-old Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, died after a chronic illness. Dolphinaris General Manager Christian Schaeffer said Kai had shown signs of declining health two weeks ago and was treated. Schaeffer says the facility “will be taking proactive measures” to ensure its dolphins’ “well-being and high quality of life.” Dolphinaris has hired an external pathologist to conduct a necropsy (animal autopsy) to determine the cause of Kai’s death. Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman of the animal rights group PETA urged Dolphiniaris to close the attraction and send the remaining dolphins to seaside sanctuaries “where they would never again be forced to haul tourists on their backs in the sweltering Arizona desert.” PETA plans a protest outside Dolphinaris Arizona at 11 a.m. Saturday.

894,"### Context: The claim that the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program due to the government shutdown is false. The Amber Alert system is not run by the federal government, but rather by individual states and coordinated through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit organization. The federal webpage promoting the program was temporarily closed due to the government shutdown, but this did not affect the operation of the program itself. The Amber Alert system continued to operate during the shutdown, with alerts being sent out in Texas and Florida. The federal webpage was restored to eliminate confusion among the public, but it was purely informational and did not impact the functioning of the program. The Amber Alert system is activated by local or state law enforcement officials when they have specific details about a missing child, such as their name, photo, and information about the suspect or vehicle involved. The system relies on media and cell phone notifications to spread the word and has been successful in locating missing children in the past. The federal webpage has never been involved in the actual process of finding missing children. Overall, the claim that the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program is false and based on a misunderstanding of how the system operates.
Claim: The Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program because of the government shutdown.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida. The one sliver of truth that triggered this claim is that a federal webpage promoting the program was closed, but that did not affect the program itself. It is a mistake to confuse that web page with the Amber Alert system.",The Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program because of the government shutdown.,"The Amber Alert program is not run by the federal government. It is a state-by-state program that is coordinated through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit organization. The federal webpage promoting the program was temporarily closed during the government shutdown, but that did not affect the operation of the program. The Amber Alert system continued to operate during the shutdown, with alerts being sent out in Texas and Florida. The federal webpage was restored to eliminate confusion among the public, but it was purely informational and did not impact the functioning of the program."
895,"### Context: Frances Arnold of the California Institute of Technology, George Smith of the University of Missouri, and Gregory Winter of the MRC molecular biology lab in Cambridge, England, have been awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in using evolution to create new proteins. The Royal Swedish Academy of Science stated that their research has led to the development of medications, biofuels, and a reduced environmental impact from some industrial processes.

Frances Arnold is only the fifth woman to win a chemistry Nobel since the prizes began in 1901. She focused on making improved enzymes, which are proteins that encourage chemical reactions to occur. Arnold used a technique called ""directed evolution"" to create random mutations in DNA that allowed cells to produce an enzyme. She then selected the mutated genes that produced the best variants of the enzyme, leading to a combination of 10 mutations that worked exceptionally well.

George Smith and Gregory Winter worked with viruses called phages that infect bacteria. Smith discovered in 1985 that inserting DNA into these viruses would make them display proteins linked to that DNA on their surfaces. Winter adapted this approach to create useful antibodies, proteins that target and grab onto disease-related targets. He introduced mutations to make antibodies progressively better at binding to their targets. Winter's work led to the development of AbbVie's adalimumab, a pharmaceutical used to treat immune-system disorders, which brought in $18.4 billion in revenue last year.

The Nobel committee stated that the winners ""have taken control of evolution and used it for purposes that bring the greatest benefit to humankind."" Their research mimicked the slow process of evolution by inducing mutations in proteins and selecting those that best met the goals of the research.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is one of several Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The medicine prize went to James Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their work on unleashing the immune system on cancers. The physics prize was awarded to scientists from the United States, Canada, and France for revolutionizing the use of lasers in research. The winners of the Nobel Peace Prize and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences are yet to be announced.

897,"### Context: A study published in the Lancet Global Health journal has found that the ""Mexico City Policy"", also known as the ""global gag rule"", has led to an increase in pregnancies and a decrease in contraceptive use among women in African countries reliant on U.S. foreign aid. The policy, which prevents U.S. federal funding from being used to support organizations that perform or provide counseling on abortion, has been rescinded and reinstated by successive U.S. administrations since it was created in 1984. The researchers warned that the policy's effects could contribute to higher maternal death rates.

The study analyzed data from 26 sub-Saharan African countries between 1995 and 2014, comparing rates of induced abortion, contraception use, and pregnancy during two U.S. policy transitions. The researchers used a ""difference-in-difference"" method to identify any changes in rates between countries with high exposure to the policy and those with low exposure. The results showed a significant 40% increase in abortion rates in countries exposed to the policy, as well as a 13.5% decrease in the use of modern contraceptives and a 12% increase in pregnancy rates.

The researchers from Stanford University, who conducted the study, emphasized the importance of recognizing the health of mothers as a global priority. They urged the United States, as the largest donor of development assistance, to reconsider the Mexico City Policy and its potential negative impact on maternal health. The study's co-leader, Nina Brooks, stated that the policy unintentionally leads to more and riskier abortions in poor countries.

The study's findings may only represent a partial view of the harm caused by the policy, as the researchers did not measure the knock-on effects of risky abortions. Eran Bendavid, another co-leader of the study, highlighted that the increase in abortion uptake could also lead to an increase in maternal deaths, particularly considering that abortions under the policy may be less safe.

In conclusion, the study provides evidence that the Mexico City Policy has resulted in higher abortion rates, lower contraceptive use, and increased pregnancy rates in African countries reliant on U.S. foreign aid. The researchers call for the United States to prioritize the health of mothers and reconsider the policy to prevent further harm to maternal health.

898,"### Context: The article debunks a Facebook post claiming that the COVID-19 virus does not exist. The post suggests that the government is using the virus as an excuse to enforce martial law and implant chips in people as a vaccine. The post has been flagged as false information by Facebook.

The article provides evidence to counter the claim, stating that there is ample evidence that the coronavirus is real and has infected hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced back to Hubei Province, China, in November. The subsequent outbreak in Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, was covered by various news outlets. The virus has since spread to over 100 countries, infecting more than 191,000 people and causing over 7,800 deaths as of March 19, according to the World Health Organization.

Scientists have isolated the genetic data and approximate origin of the virus, which is believed to have originated from bats. They have also released microscopic images of the coronavirus. COVID-19 is classified as a ""novel"" or new coronavirus, meaning it had not been previously identified. The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and global health emergency.

Several countries, including France, Italy, and Spain, have implemented nationwide lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus based on the advice of health officials. These prevention measures have led to the plunge of global financial markets and widespread layoffs.

The article concludes that the claim made in the Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous, as there is overwhelming evidence supporting the existence of the COVID-19 virus.

899,"### Context: The article discusses the ""Metabo Law"" that was passed in Japan in 2008 in an effort to combat obesity. The law requires men and women between the ages of 45 and 74 to have their waistlines examined once a year and potentially seek medical treatment if their measurements fall outside established ranges. However, the law does not establish obesity as a criminal offense.

The Metabo Law is named after metabolic syndrome, which is a group of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. These conditions increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The law aims to encourage aggressive lifestyle changes to prevent the development of serious health problems.

According to the New York Times, the Metabo Law sets the waistline limits at 35.4 inches for men and 31.5 inches for women, which are identical to the measurements established by the International Diabetes Federation in 2006. Individuals exceeding these limits may be required to attend counseling sessions or consult with a health expert about dietary options.

The government aims to reduce the overweight population by 10% over the next four years and 25% over the next seven years. To achieve this, financial penalties will be imposed on companies and local governments that fail to meet specific targets. The Ministry of Health argues that this campaign will help control the spread of diseases like diabetes and strokes and reduce the ballooning healthcare costs in Japan.

Opponents of the Metabo Law argue that the weight guidelines are too strict. Japan is one of the least obese developed nations in the world, and some experts believe that the law will not have a significant effect on the health of Japan's citizens. Yoichi Ogushi, a professor at Tokai University's School of Medicine, states that the Japanese population is already slender and cannot afford to lose weight.

In summary, the Metabo Law in Japan requires waistline examinations for individuals between the ages of 45 and 74 but does not criminalize obesity. The law aims to combat metabolic syndrome and reduce the overweight population through aggressive lifestyle changes. Financial penalties will be imposed on companies and local governments that fail to meet specific targets. However, there are concerns that the weight guidelines are too strict for a population that is already relatively slender.
Claim: A law in Japan makes it illegal for citizens of that country to be fat.

House Speaker Paul Ryan blames Democrats for blocking the bill, while Democrats argue that Republicans added a clause to block funding for a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico. Ryan is correct that Senate Democrats agreed to a $1.1 billion plan, but the bill they rejected had the Planned Parenthood funding ban.

901,"### Context: According to an article, Donald Trump's claim that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border is true. The article states that while Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the White House's page on the international heroin market both confirm that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. The article also provides data from the DEA report, which shows that South America and Mexico have been the sources of much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades. Mexican traffickers have expanded their market share by introducing black tar heroin into Northeastern markets and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin. In 2014, Mexican heroin accounted for 79 percent of the total weight of heroin seized and analyzed by the DEA. The article also mentions that the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico has increased by 169 percent from 2013 to 2015. Border seizures of heroin have also increased significantly, with seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection nearly quadrupling from 2008 to 2015. The article explains that traffickers typically smuggle the drugs across the border in secret compartments in vehicles, transport them to stash houses in hub cities, and then distribute them to the Midwest and East Coast. The article concludes that Trump's claim that heroin comes from the southern border is supported by the evidence.

902,"### Context: The article discusses a meme that circulated on social media in January 2019, which referenced a 2016 Swedish crime story involving the murder of a 15-year-old boy named Arminas Pileckas. The meme contained unverified information and reflected the talking points favored by anti-immigration partisans. The claim made in the meme was that Pileckas was murdered because he was trying to protect a Swedish girl from sexual harassment by a Syrian refugee.

The article highlights that the information publicly available about the case is limited. It is known that Pileckas was allegedly stabbed by a 14-year-old schoolmate in the small town of Broby in Sweden on January 11, 2016. Pileckas was taken to the hospital where he died from his injuries. However, the motive for the killing has not been verified by authorities, and media reports about it are drawn from interviews given by the parents of both children.

The article mentions that right-leaning Swedish website Fria Tider reported that Pileckas was stabbed to death by a student from the Arab world after protecting a girl whom the killer had harassed. Similarly, Breitbart ran a headline stating that Pileckas was stabbed to death by an Arab migrant because he was protecting a young girl from sexual assault. However, the article emphasizes that criminal proceedings involving children are not public in Sweden, and those with detailed knowledge about the case are prohibited from commenting on it publicly due to the young age of the offender.

Both Pileckas and the 14-year-old suspect were immigrants, with Pileckas' family being from Lithuania and the suspect being from Syria. Authorities in Sweden do not furnish personal information about suspects, particularly minors, and Swedish media outlets typically do not publish it.

The article mentions that discussions about motives initially surfaced on social media and reports from news outlets operating in the native languages of the suspect and victim. Pileckas' father stated in interviews with Lithuanian-language news outlets that his son was killed because he had defended a female student against harassment from the suspect.

The claim that Pileckas was protecting a girl from sexual assault may have originated from unconfirmed reports about the murder investigation and unfounded internet rumors labeling Sweden the ""rape capital of Europe."" However, there is no official corroboration for this claim, and it is unlikely that law enforcement in Sweden would disclose such information due to privacy laws applying to minors.

903,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that the classic gospel song ""Precious Lord Take My Hand"" was written by Tommy Dorsey, a jazz pianist and composer, rather than the band leader Tommy Dorsey. The trombonist and band leader Tommy Dorsey was born in 1905 and died in 1956, while the composer of the song, Tommy Dorsey, was born in 1899 and died in 1993. The composer is regarded as the father of gospel music and had a successful career as a blues musician before switching to gospel music.

The article also provides the actual story of the tragic death of Tommy Dorsey's wife, which differs from the eRumor. According to Dorsey's own account in Guideposts Magazine, he was scheduled to sing for a revival in St. Louis but had anxiety about going because his wife was in her 9th month of pregnancy. When he left his home, he realized he had forgotten his music case and returned to get it. He found his wife sleeping and felt something telling him to stay home, but he decided to leave for the revival. The next night, he received a telegram informing him that his wife had died. He returned home to learn that his wife had given birth to a baby boy before she died, but the baby had also died.

Dorsey went through a difficult period after the tragedy and contemplated giving up serving the Lord and going back to jazz. He questioned whether his reluctance to leave his pregnant wife had been a leading from God and whether he had been disobedient by ignoring it. However, during a subsequent visit to a friend, he sat down at a piano and found peace, with a melody being played. This became the song ""Precious Lord Take My Hand."" Dorsey wrote that the Lord gave him the words and melody and also healed his spirit. He learned that in times of deep grief, when one feels farthest from God, that is when He is closest and when one is most open to His restoring power.

In conclusion, the article confirms that the composer of the song ""Precious Lord Take My Hand"" was Tommy Dorsey, a jazz pianist and composer, and not the band leader Tommy Dorsey. It also provides the actual story of the tragic death of Dorsey's wife and how it influenced the writing of the song.

904,"### Context: A 27-year-old leukemia patient from China named Su has turned to livestreaming to help pay for her treatment. Diagnosed with leukemia four months ago, Su has been using the popular Chinese livestreaming app Inke to make videos about her life with the disease. In just six weeks, she gained nearly 800 fans and received virtual gifts from viewers, earning up to 400 yuan ($60) at a time. While the earnings are not enough to cover her medical bills, Su says that livestreaming has boosted her confidence and helped alleviate the loneliness of being in the hospital.

Su's story is part of a larger movement in China to make cancer drugs more affordable. The popularity of the recent film ""Dying to Survive,"" which tells the story of a Chinese businessman who smuggles a cheaper leukemia drug from India, has brought attention to the issue. The movie has made over $400 million since its release in July and has prompted government action. Several provinces in China have already lowered drug prices by up to 10 percent, and the government has exempted cancer drugs from import tariffs.

The film has been criticized for vilifying foreign pharmaceutical companies while absolving Chinese authorities of responsibility. However, it has also been praised for addressing serious issues in an indirect and comedic way, which allows it to navigate the country's strict censorship regulations. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to accelerate the process of making cancer medication more affordable.

The article also mentions that Chinese labs are working on designing equally effective drugs for a fraction of the price. Imported drugs are currently too expensive for many patients, and organizations like the Beijing-based Heart to Heart foundation are helping to match funds for patients who need expensive medications.

Overall, Su's livestreaming efforts and the success of ""Dying to Survive"" have shed light on the struggle for affordable cancer drugs in China. The government has taken action to lower drug prices, and there is hope that Chinese labs will develop more affordable alternatives in the future.

905,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson that assault rifles are already banned in the United States. The article explains that the definition of assault rifles depends on whether they are automatic or semiautomatic weapons. Automatic weapons, which fire continuously when the trigger is held down, have been banned in the US since 1935 and 1986. However, semiautomatic weapons, which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed, are not banned by federal law.

The article points out that Johnson's claim is misleading because it gives the impression of a comprehensive ban on assault rifles. While some argue that only automatic weapons should be considered assault rifles, the article states that this is not a generally accepted definition. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which expired in 2004, defined some semiautomatic guns as assault weapons, and many state laws still use this definition. Law enforcement agencies also consider certain semiautomatic weapons, including the one used in the Orlando shooting, as assault weapons or assault-style weapons.

The article concludes that Johnson's claim ignores critical facts and gives a misleading impression. While there are federal laws banning automatic weapons, semiautomatic weapons, which are commonly referred to as assault weapons, are not banned by federal law. Therefore, the claim that ""assault rifles already are banned"" is not entirely accurate.
Claim: Assault rifles already are banned.

906,"### Context: A recent study conducted by Rutgers University suggests that a portable device commonly used in optometrists' offices may hold the key to faster diagnosis of schizophrenia. The device, which costs less than $15,000, accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers of participants with schizophrenia. However, the study did not provide any numbers regarding the identification of patients with schizophrenia or the accuracy of ruling out the disorder in those who did not have it. The safety of the device and the chances of false positives or false negatives were also not discussed in the study or the accompanying news release.

The study involved a small number of participants, and it is unclear whether the study was blinded. To demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of the device, a larger sample size and a more diverse group of participants would be necessary. The study did not mention who funded the research, and it was not disclosed that one of the authors is employed by the company that manufactures the device.

The news release did not provide much context about schizophrenia, other than describing it as a devastating and poorly understood disorder. The prevalence of schizophrenia in the US is estimated to be between 0.25 percent and 0.64 percent of the population. The current method of diagnosing schizophrenia involves a checklist of symptoms, but the accuracy and cost of this method were not discussed.

The news release claimed that this was the first time a portable device was used for these tests, but previous studies have explored the use of biomarkers in the eye to understand psychiatric disorders as early as 1999. The study was not conclusive enough to be considered a diagnostic tool, and further research is needed to develop a test that clinicians can use to diagnose, treat, and monitor people with schizophrenia.

In summary, the study suggests that a portable device used in optometrists' offices may have potential for faster diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, the study had limitations such as a small sample size and lack of information on safety and accuracy. The study did not provide much context about schizophrenia or disclose funding sources. Further research is needed to determine the diagnostic usefulness of the device.

907,"### Context: According to data obtained through a public records request, there were more than 50 complaints about e-cigarettes filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between March 2013 and March 2014, which is on par with the combined number reported over the previous five years. The health problems reported were not necessarily caused by e-cigarettes, and it is unclear if the rate of adverse events has increased. However, the director of the FDA's tobacco division, David Ashley, believes that the uptick in complaints is significant, especially in light of a recent report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing an increase in the number of e-cigarette-related calls to poison control centers.

The FDA is preparing to regulate e-cigarettes and other vaping devices for the first time, potentially reshaping an industry that generates roughly $2 billion a year in the United States. Some industry analysts predict that e-vapor consumption could surpass that of traditional cigarettes within a decade. E-cigarettes are battery-powered cartridges filled with a nicotine liquid that, when heated, creates an inhalable mist. The long-term health effects of these products are still largely unknown.

Preliminary studies have produced contradictory findings about the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes, which has fueled the debate between public health officials and e-cigarette advocates. Public health officials argue that e-cigarettes may encourage nonsmokers, particularly young people, to try conventional cigarettes, while e-cigarette advocates claim that they provide a safer alternative for smokers.

The FDA has sponsored research to address safety concerns and is examining its database of adverse events for any trends that might raise concerns. The complaints filed with the FDA cited various health problems such as trouble breathing, headache, cough, dizziness, sore throat, nose bleeds, chest pain, cardiovascular problems, and allergic reactions. Some individuals reported experiencing adverse effects from second-hand exposure to e-cigarette vapor.

Most e-cigarettes are made in China and sold under more than 300 brands in the United States, making it difficult to determine the cause of any health problems due to inconsistent product quality. Some e-cigarette makers are starting to produce their products in the United States to address quality concerns. Reynolds American Inc, for example, makes its Vuse e-cigarettes in Kansas and North Carolina, although it still imports batteries from China.

In conclusion, reports of e-cigarette injuries have increased as the popularity of these devices has risen. The FDA is preparing to regulate e-cigarettes, and there is growing recognition that the inconsistent quality of the devices, along with the inhalation of nicotine vapor, poses potential safety risks.

909,"### Context: A blood test has been developed that could potentially predict if a pregnancy is at risk for premature labor. The test measures cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in the blood, which is genetic material released by cells that can provide information about the health of the pregnancy. The study, funded by the March of Dimes and other nonprofit sources, involved 38 women and found that the test had a 45% accuracy rate in identifying pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery, compared to the current standard assessment tool, ultrasound, which has a 48% accuracy rate. The test is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab.

The article highlights the potential benefits of the blood test, such as providing a more affordable alternative to ultrasound, which can cost thousands of dollars. However, it also mentions the risks of false-positive results, which can lead to high stress and anxiety, unnecessary treatments, and other possible harms. The rate of false-positive results in the study was nearly 17%.

The article provides a clear explanation of how the test works and its limitations. It mentions that the study was small and only included white and black ethnicities, which limits its generalizability. The article also mentions that the authors have applied to patent the blood test, suggesting they stand to profit from its approval and widespread use.

The article compares the accuracy of the blood test to ultrasound and mentions that ultrasound is currently the go-to method for identifying pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery. It also references other blood tests that use cfRNA but emphasizes the novelty of the experimental preterm pregnancy test.

However, the article does not provide critical context about other biomarkers that have been studied for predicting preterm birth. It mentions that previous studies have not found any biomarkers to be clinically useful in predicting preterm birth in asymptomatic women.

Overall, the article provides a thorough summary of the study and its findings. It includes important details about the test's accuracy, limitations, and potential risks. However, it lacks an outside perspective on the study and does not provide critical context about the challenges of developing biomarkers for predicting preterm birth.
Claim: This Blood Test Could Help Predict If A Pregnancy Is At Risk For Premature Labor
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This BuzzFeed News story reports on early-stage research into an experimental blood test that aims to predict whether or not a pregnancy is at risk for premature birth. To determine that risk, the test looks for specific pieces of RNA generated by the baby that migrate into a mother’s bloodstream and which are associated with preterm deliveries. The story offers a short, readable, un-hyped, and eminently useful summary of the research, and it offers several comparisons to the standard alternative, which is an ultrasound scan. The story would have benefited from an outside expert weighing on the study and its potential ramifications and — more importantly — the potential harms of a false-positive test, which are not insignificant. According to the CDC, preterm birth affects about one in every 10 infants born in the US. Significant advances to lower preterm birth rates are certainly newsworthy–but this is an idea that’s been tested and failed before (see novelty, below) and readers need to know that.",This Blood Test Could Help Predict If A Pregnancy Is At Risk For Premature Labor,"This is a news release about a study that looked at whether a blood test could predict preterm birth. The study found that the test was only slightly more accurate than the current method of using ultrasound to predict preterm birth. The news release does a good job of explaining the study and its limitations. It also does a good job of explaining the potential benefits of a blood test, such as providing a more affordable alternative to ultrasound. However, the release does not provide critical context about the challenges of developing biomarkers for predicting preterm birth. The release also does not provide an outside perspective on the study. Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. If a blood test could predict preterm birth, it could help doctors identify women at risk and provide them with interventions to prevent preterm birth. However, the release does not provide an estimate of the cost of the test."
910,"### Context: The article discusses a video that went viral on social media, showing a line of fire burning across a field. The video was shared on the Nature is Fucking Lit section of Reddit with the caption ""Poplar fluff burning in Spain."" The authenticity of the video and its location were questioned by viewers.

The earliest version of the video was posted on the Club De Montaña Calahorra Facebook page, along with another video, with a caption warning viewers about the fluff. Spanish news outlets, such as Cope and La Rioja, picked up the video and reported that it was filmed at Parque del Cidacos in Calahorra, La Rioja, Spain. The park had been covered in a white cloak of poplar fluff for several days, but the fire suddenly burned it all, revealing the green color of the lawn.

The ""fluff"" in the video is actually seeds from the poplar tree. The city of Calgary provided information about poplar fluff on their website, stating that it is produced by female poplar trees and is not the cause of allergies. Allergies are usually triggered by native grasses and other flowering plants that coincide with the poplar fluff season. However, poplar fluff is flammable and can contribute to the spread of wildfires.

The article also mentions a previous incident in Assiniboine Forest, where an unusually large amount of poplar fluff worsened a fire in Winnipeg, Canada.

In summary, the video shows poplar fluff burning in a field in Spain. The video was confirmed to be filmed at Parque del Cidacos in Calahorra, La Rioja. Poplar fluff is not the cause of allergies, but it is flammable and can contribute to the spread of wildfires.

911,"### Context: The article discusses an ad campaign by the conservative Club for Growth that criticizes the government-run health insurance option proposed in the health care reform plan. The ad implies that the reform plan would lead to callous decisions that would allow people to die if they face a costly treatment. The ad references the British system, specifically the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. The ad claims that NICE has a price limit of $22,750 for six months of life, which is roughly accurate. However, the article clarifies that the reform plan does not include such cost limits. The ad also mentions a proposal by the White House to create an independent group of health experts to look for inefficiencies in Medicare coverage, which could potentially lead to rationing. However, this proposal is not included in the current health reform bills. The article concludes that while the ad gets the statistic about NICE correct, its main point about cost limits is incorrect. The health reform proposals pending in Congress would not require the government to decide how much a person's life is worth.
Claim: The health care reform plan would set limits similar to the ""socialized"" system in Britain, where people are allowed to die if their treatment would cost more than $22,000.
The claim veracity: false

912,"### Context: The article discusses the FDA's review of the weight-loss drug Qnexa and highlights some important aspects that were missing from the coverage. The author criticizes the lack of information regarding the cost of Qnexa and suggests that analysts could have projected the expected costs. The article also mentions that many obesity doctors prescribe two separate drugs that, when taken together, are essentially the same medicine, and argues that some estimate of the cost of these components could have been given.

The author expresses a desire for more data and real information about the drug's effectiveness. They suggest that the story could have included data from clinical trials to provide readers with a better understanding of the magnitude of weight loss seen with Qnexa. The article notes that the FDA briefing documents mention concerns about potential side effects of Qnexa, including increased heart rate, birth defects, and thinking problems.

The author criticizes the lack of information about the FDA Advisory Panel's proceedings and suggests that the story could have linked to the transcripts and summary of the panel's meeting in 2010. They argue that this would have helped readers grasp the weight of the evidence.

The article mentions that there was no disease-mongering of overweight or obesity in the story and that several independent sources were cited. It quotes one source who highlights the challenge of finding medical treatments for obesity, considering the magnitude of the problem in the country.

The article also criticizes the lack of information about the fact that Qnexa is one of three obesity drugs vying to be the first on the market in 13 years. It suggests that this angle should have been included in the story. Additionally, the article points out that Qnexa is a combination of two drugs, phentermine and topiramate, which are known to cause weight loss.

Overall, the article argues that the coverage of the FDA's review of Qnexa was lacking in important information and could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the drug and its potential benefits and risks.

### Explanation:
",mixture,"We like how the blog post linked to the FDA briefing documents, allowing interested readers to do more homework if they wished. That’s a little addition – that can be a big help for readers – and for the completeness of the overall reporting effort. However, the story could have directly included – even at a high level – some of the data from the clinical trials so that readers could have an appreciation for the magnitude of the weight loss seen. The one line – “Qnexa does appear to help many people lose at 5 percent of their body weight” – wasn’t sufficient in our view. The tradeoffs of potential benefits and harms with this drug represent vital public health and safety issues – and, if approved, set the stage for important physician-patient shared decision-making discussions.",Weight-Loss Drugs Face High Hurdles At FDA,"This was a story about the FDA’s review of a weight-loss drug, Qnexa, that was pulled from the market in October 2010. The story did a good job of explaining the FDA’s concerns about the drug, but it didn’t give readers enough data to understand the magnitude of the benefits of the drug, or the risks. It also didn’t give readers enough context about the drug’s development and the FDA’s review process.

913,"### Context: Rick Green, a candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, claims that he was considered the fourth-most conservative state representative during his time in the Texas House. To support this claim, Green's campaign points to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report, which graded lawmakers based on their voting records. According to the report, Green and two other members of the House voted with the conservative position 88 percent of the time, making them the fourth-most conservative members. However, it is important to note that this ranking only applies to Green's first term in the House and not his second term.

The report evaluated lawmakers based on 28 criteria that defined conservative positions, including making government more efficient, strengthening the family, reducing taxes, and protecting citizens' ability to make a living. It highlighted 12 votes on various topics, such as property taxes, abortion, and standardized testing, to determine lawmakers' conservative positions.

One vote that the report highlighted was on a bill to expand the state's hate crimes law. The report considered voting against the bill as the conservative position because it believed the bill would give ""special rights"" to certain groups and did not align with ""traditional Judeo/Christian moral values."" Green voted against the bill, but it ultimately failed to become law.

In his second term, Green's conservative ranking slipped according to the report. In 2001, he took the group's favored position 65 percent of the time, compared to the House average of 34 percent. He tied with three others as the 11th-most conservative House member, with 30 members siding more often with the group's preferred positions.

The report also penalized Green for two voice votes, where lawmakers' positions are determined by choruses of ""ayes"" and ""nays"" on the House floor. One vote was on a proposal to mandate health insurance coverage for anorexia and bulimia as serious mental illnesses, and the other was on a bill requiring gender-neutral terminology in publications by the state attorney general's office. Green did not request his vote to be separately recorded, so the report marked him as voting against the group's preferred positions.

In summary, Green accurately states that he was considered the fourth-most conservative state representative during his first term in the Texas House, according to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report. However, he fails to mention that his conservative ranking slipped in his second term.

914,"### Context: A study comparing robotic surgery with two other surgical techniques found that robotic surgeries are more expensive but have lower mortality rates. The study quantified the operative mortality, blood transfusion, and length-of-stay rates among the three groups studied. However, the article did not consistently provide data for all three types of surgery. The study did not include the costs of purchasing a robotic system or the indirect economic benefits of patients' early return to work and increased productivity. It also failed to capture the human cost of the learning curve, as outcomes are often worse for patients early in the learning curve. Additionally, the study did not include patient-reported outcomes such as postoperative pain, return to baseline functional status, and health-related quality of life. These outcomes are important in assessing the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive technologies. The article did not provide context on the growing body of literature about comparative effectiveness questions in this field. The focus of the article was on the study comparing robot-assisted surgery with the other techniques. The availability of all three surgical approaches studied could be inferred from the study details reported. It is unclear if the article relied on a news release.
Claim: Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"We don’t think the story conveyed the conclusion of the researchers, nor that of the the editorial writer. The researchers concluded: “While robotic assisted and laparoscopic surgery are associated with fewer deaths, complications, transfusions and shorter length of hospital stay compared to open surgery, robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery is more costly than laparoscopic and open surgery. Additional studies are needed to better delineate the comparative and cost effectivenss of robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery relative to laparoscopic surgery and open surgery.” That conclusion sends a somewhat different message than that delivered in the story – and the difference is important. And the editorial writer stated that the study “failed to capture 3 important elements.” And then he clearly spelled those out. The story didn’t convey the depth/details of those concerns. What are the outcomes that readers/patients should really care about? That’s the question the editorial raised – or that many other independent observers would raise about this study.

915,"### Context: A recent study suggests that the diabetes drug metformin may help reduce the risk of lung cancer. The study, conducted on mice, found that those treated with metformin had 40-50% fewer tumors compared to those not treated with the drug. In addition, the mice genetically engineered to be susceptible to lung tumors had 72% fewer tumors when given metformin. The findings were described as ""strong"" by the researchers.

The article does not mention the cost of metformin, which is relatively cheap as a generic, making it potentially appealing as a preventive approach. The story also fails to provide absolute risk reduction figures, only presenting the results in relative terms. It is unclear what the reduction in tumors is compared to, which is important information that should have been included.

The article does not discuss any potential harms of metformin use in mice, leaving readers wondering about the safety of the drug. The lack of discussion on this topic is a weakness of the story.

The article also fails to mention any possible mechanisms of action of metformin or the fact that a small human study on the drug's effects on lung cancer was reported. The HealthDay story, on the other hand, provides more information on these aspects, including a discussion of possible mechanisms of action and the existence of human research in this area.

The article does not engage in disease mongering or exaggerate the risks of tobacco use, which is a positive aspect. However, it only quotes an expert who wrote a review on metformin research, without evidence of any independent interviewing.

The article does mention that metformin is already widely used in people and briefly mentions other past research on metformin and cancer risk. However, it does not provide a meaningful comparison with other lung cancer prevention approaches or parallel human research in this field, as the HealthDay story does.

Overall, the article lacks important information and fails to provide a comprehensive analysis of the study's findings. It could have been improved by including cost information, absolute risk reduction figures, discussion of potential harms, mechanisms of action, and comparisons with other research.

916,"### Context: The claim that Missouri employers will gain the right to fire people who use birth control when a state bill becomes law is incorrect. A St. Louis ordinance passed in February prohibits discrimination based on reproductive health care decisions. However, Missouri Senate Bill 5 (SB 5), which was signed by the governor in July, will overturn that local ordinance when it takes effect in October. There have been claims that the bill would allow employers to fire workers for using birth control, but there is no evidence to support this. Media sources such as Allure, Refinery29, and Newsweek initially reported that the bill would allow for employees to be fired for using birth control, but Newsweek later corrected their article. These news organizations referenced an ad by NARAL Pro-Choice Missouri that asked if employers should be able to fire employees for using birth control. However, it was the rhetoric of Republicans and not the actual language of the bill that led to this interpretation. The bill does not specifically mention birth control or contraceptives, except in cases where employers can refuse healthcare if they don't want to pay for birth control. Under the bill, property owners can refuse to rent or sell to a person who plans to use the facility as an abortion clinic that isn't for the sole purpose of saving the mother's life. The bill also does not affect the protection provided by St. Louis' city ordinance, which prevents employers from firing employees who use birth control. Federal law also prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating against employees based on their reproductive choices, such as taking contraception. In summary, while Missouri Senate Bill 5 imposes higher restrictions on abortion providers and allows real estate agents to refuse to sell or rent them land, it does not give employers the right to fire workers for using contraceptives.

917,"### Context: Alabama Senator Doug Jones has criticized the new abortion ban signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey, calling it ""shameful"" and ""callous."" The legislation, which would make performing an abortion a felony in almost all cases, does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Supporters of the bill hope to challenge the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in 1973. Governor Ivey, on the other hand, believes the law reflects the deeply held belief of Alabamians that every life is precious and a sacred gift from God.

Jones, the only Democrat holding statewide office in Alabama, believes that the debate surrounding the bill is driven by extreme voices on both sides and does not represent the views of most people in the state. However, the bill's sponsor, Representative Terri Collins, argues that a majority of Alabamians support the legislation, citing a November vote in which 59% of state voters agreed to include anti-abortion language in the Alabama Constitution.

The Alabama abortion ban is considered the most far-reaching measure among conservative states that are pushing for new abortion restrictions in hopes of challenging Roe v. Wade with the conservative majority in the Supreme Court. The ban would take effect in six months unless blocked by legal challenges, which Jones expects to cost millions of dollars. Abortion rights advocates have vowed to take swift legal action against the law.

The legislation passed by Alabama senators would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony, punishable by 10 to 99 years or life in prison for the provider, with the only exception being when the woman's health is at serious risk. Women seeking or undergoing abortions would not be punished.

Other conservative states, including Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, and Georgia, have recently approved bans on abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around the sixth week of pregnancy. Missouri's Republican-led Senate also voted to ban abortions at eight weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Louisiana lawmakers are also moving towards passing a six-week ban.

The new abortion ban in Alabama has sparked both fear and energization among women. Dr. Yashica Robinson, who provides abortions in Huntsville, expressed sadness over the setback for women's rights but also noted an outpouring of support from individuals offering help and expressing love.

918,"### Context: The claim that Italy has concluded that Covid-19 is not a virus and that people are dying from amplified global 5G electromagnetic radiation poisoning is not supported by the information in the article. Italy did not make such a conclusion. The World Health Organization (WHO) did not prohibit autopsies on Covid-19 patients, and Italy did not disobey any world health law in this regard.

Italy has found that Covid-19 can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (thrombosis), which is a condition where blood clots form throughout the body's blood vessels. The recommended treatment for this condition includes antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and anticoagulants. However, it is important to note that antibiotics do not directly treat the virus causing Covid-19.

The article mentions that Covid-19 is not a virus but a bacterium that is amplified by 5G, causing inflammation and hypoxia. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Covid-19 is caused by a virus, not a bacterium, and there is no proven link between the virus and 5G technology.

The article suggests that people with Covid-19 should take aspirin 100mg and Apronax or paracetamol. While trials are ongoing to assess the effectiveness of these drugs in treating Covid-19, they have not yet concluded. Paracetamol can help alleviate symptoms but is not a specific treatment for the virus.

It is mentioned that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting problems, which can be fatal. While this is true, it is not the only factor that can lead to fatalities in Covid-19 patients.

The claim that Italy sent home over 14,000 patients after treating them with aspirin and Apronax is not supported by any evidence. The Italian Medicines Agency does not include these drugs in its list of approved treatments for Covid-19 outside of clinical trials.

Lastly, there is no order to incinerate or immediately bury Covid-19 bodies without autopsy. Autopsies can be conducted to better understand the disease and its effects on the body.

In summary, the claim that Italy has concluded that Covid-19 is not a virus and that people are dying from 5G electromagnetic radiation poisoning is not supported by the information in the article. Italy has found that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting issues, but this is not the only factor leading to fatalities. The recommended treatments for Covid-19 include antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and anticoagulants, but there is no specific cure for the virus at this time.

919,"### Context: U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles is considering whether to expand a former radiology professor's anti-trust lawsuit to cover thousands of doctors, nurses, and other employees at Duke University. The judge is inclined to include about 2,000 Duke medical faculty in the case but exclude nurses and other medical workers. The University of North Carolina (UNC) has been dropped from the lawsuit, but its hospital, medical school, and administrators have agreed to provide documents to the plaintiff's lawyers. UNC will not pay any money in the settlement and promises not to participate in any unlawful restraints on competition. The plaintiff's lawyers have presented emails and other documents suggesting that administrators at Duke and UNC may have conspired to hold down salaries for highly paid medical experts. Both universities deny the existence of the alleged no-hire agreement. Duke argues that doctors have moved from teaching to private practice, demonstrating that the alleged agreement did not control the local labor market. The plaintiff's lawyer claims that the heads of the two medical schools discussed the agreement not to poach each other's medical professors at two meetings in 2004, but the agreement may have dated back to the 1990s. A statistical analysis estimates that the conspiracy reduced the earnings of Duke physicians by about 8 percent. The case originated from the plaintiff's unsuccessful attempt to move from her position at Duke to a similar job at UNC. In an email, the UNC cardiothoracic imaging chief stated that lateral moves of faculty between Duke and UNC were not permitted due to an agreement between the deans of the two schools. The plaintiff's lawyer argues that this agreement was hatched to reduce competition and costs after a previous recruitment attempt by Duke.

920,"### Context: The claim that New York state has legalized heroin is false. The article in question was published by Empire News, a website known for its satirical content. The website clearly labels its content as ""satire"" in its disclaimer. However, the article was later republished by other websites that do not clearly identify themselves as purveyors of fake news.

It is important to note that there have been recent discussions about a controversial plan proposed by Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick to allow heroin users to use the drug legally under medical supervision. This proposal has divided drug policy experts, with some supporting it as an innovative approach and others rejecting it as radical. However, this proposal is specific to Ithaca and does not reflect a statewide legalization of heroin in New York.

The article highlights the need for readers to be cautious and discerning when consuming news from various sources. In this case, the false information was spread by websites that did not clearly indicate that they were sharing fake news. It is crucial to verify the credibility and reliability of sources before accepting information as true.

In conclusion, the claim that New York state has legalized heroin is not true. The article in question is a piece of fiction from a satirical website, and it was later republished by other websites that did not clearly identify themselves as purveyors of fake news.

921,"### Context: The article discusses a new blood test that can potentially replace the traditional skin prick test for diagnosing allergies. The blood test, known as the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, is said to be more convenient and less painful for patients. It measures the levels of specific antibodies in the blood that are associated with allergic reactions.

The article mentions that some allergists resist using blood tests because it may affect their revenue. However, it does not provide information on the cost of the blood test compared to the skin prick test. The benefits of the blood test compared to the skin test are also not quantified, other than convenience and fewer side effects.

The article does not address whether using the blood test in combination with treatment leads to better outcomes for patients. It only mentions one harm of the blood test, which is the process of getting blood drawn. It fails to mention other potential harms such as false positive or negative results, or how the results may be misinterpreted by non-allergy specialist clinicians.

The strength of the available evidence to support the use of the blood test is not described in the article. It does not present any data on whether more diagnostic testing will result in better outcomes.

The article is criticized for disease mongering by not emphasizing that the blood and skin tests are only necessary for those with severe allergies. It overstates the risk of children with allergies developing respiratory problems and asthma later on.

The article mentions that the blood test is available but its use is limited in the U.S. It suggests that patients can consider skin testing or talking to their primary care doctors about their symptoms as alternatives to the blood test.

The article states that the blood tests were developed in the 1970s but newer tests have become available more recently. It quotes multiple experts, indicating that it does not solely rely on a press release as the source of information. However, it does not provide information on the actual fees surrounding either the blood tests or the skin prick tests.

",mixture,"This story reports on the use of a blood test, Immunoglobulin E (IgE), to diagnose allergies. The shots would replace the traditional method of diagnosis – a series of skin pricks to show a reaction to various allergens. While this story does a good job of explaining the benefits of having one blood test compared to a series of skin pricks, the story does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence. The story states that the blood tests were developed in the 1970s but that newer tests have become available more recently. The story does say that the test is available and comments that its use is limited in the U.S. However, the story does not quantify the benefits of the blood test compared to the skin test. It is not clear from the story if the blood test results in better outcomes for the patient other than convenience and fewer side effects. The question of whether using the blood test in combination with treatment results in better outcomes for the patient is unanswered. Furthermore, the story only mentions one harm of the blood test – getting the blood drawn itself. The story should have mentioned other harms such as what happens with false positive or negative results or how the results may be misinterpreted by non-allergy specialist clinicians. Finally, the story commits disease mongering by not explaining that the blood and skin tests are only used in those with severe allergies. Most people with common pet or seasonal allergies will not require this kind of testing. Furthermore, the story overstates the risk that children with allergies have of developing respiratory problems and asthma later on.","In testing for allergies, a single shot may suffice","This is a story about a new test for allergies that is gaining in popularity.

923,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) that a ""radical group of atheists"" is demanding that all hotels remove Bibles from their rooms. The ACLJ published an image and a petition on Facebook, claiming that the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) is trying to ban the Bible from university hotel rooms. The FFRF had sent a letter to Northern Illinois University stating that it was unconstitutional to have Bibles in the Holmes Student Center Hotel. The university responded by removing the Bibles from the hotel rooms. The ACLJ's claim that the FFRF is trying to ban the Bible from all hotel rooms is misleading, as the issue only pertains to public universities and government endorsement of religious texts. The ACLJ also published an article claiming that the FFRF is demanding that all hotels remove the Bible from bedside tables, but this is not supported by evidence. The FFRF did send a letter to various hotel companies, asking them to consider offering ""Bible-free"" rooms for non-theist or non-Christian guests. The FFRF cited examples of hotels that have already removed Bibles from their rooms to avoid discrimination. The article concludes that the ACLJ's claim that atheists are trying to ban Bibles from all hotel rooms is not accurate and that the FFRF's request only pertains to specific situations and does not involve a complete ban on Bibles.

924,"### Context: The claim that Canine Carry Outs dog treats contain anti-freeze and are dangerous to dogs is not accurate. There have been rumors circulating on social media that Canine Carry Outs contains propylene glycol, which is sometimes referred to as anti-freeze. However, propylene glycol is a common food additive that is classified as safe when consumed within recommended limits. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved propylene glycol for use in food, including dog treats. It is used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain medicines, cosmetics, or food products. It is also used in the paint and plastics industries. Propylene glycol is different from ethylene glycol, which is the active compound in most automobile radiator anti-freeze solutions and is toxic to animals and humans when ingested. Canine Carry Outs dog treats do not contain ethylene glycol. 

The rumor about Canine Carry Outs closely resembled a similar rumor about Purina's Beneful brand pet food, which also circulated in early 2015. It is possible that the rumor stemmed from earlier alerts that mentioned other brands of dog foods in conjunction with propylene glycol. However, it is important to note that propylene glycol is not a hidden ingredient in pet treats and is not inherently dangerous to dogs in any amount.

In 2016, a veterinarian claimed that one of her canine patients had been poisoned by Canine Carry Outs and that the FDA had recommended removal of these treats. However, the FDA has never issued any warning or recall/withdrawal notice about Canine Carry Outs brand dog treats.

Overall, the claim that Canine Carry Outs dog treats contain anti-freeze and are dangerous to dogs is not supported by evidence. Propylene glycol, which is sometimes referred to as anti-freeze, is a safe food additive approved by the FDA for use in dog treats.

925,"### Context: A study has found that nicotine patches may help improve memory in people with mild cognitive impairment. The study involved 67 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either a nicotine patch or a placebo patch for six months. The participants were then assessed for memory and cognitive function. The study found that those who received the nicotine patch showed a 46% improvement in memory compared to a 26% decline in those who received the placebo patch. However, it is important to note that the study did not find a significant difference in overall change between the two groups when assessed by clinical experts. The study also found that the nicotine patch was safe for long-term use, with only minor side effects such as nausea and dizziness reported. There were no withdrawal symptoms reported when participants stopped using the patch. The study did not find any evidence of nicotine patches causing cancer, although there is some research linking nicotine to cancer. The article notes that the study did not discuss the cost of nicotine patches, but online prices range from around $2.70 per day. The article also criticizes the lack of explanation of the percentages used to quantify the benefits of nicotine patches. It suggests that the nicotine may simply be improving symptoms rather than helping with the actual disease. The article also mentions that the study did not distinguish between mild cognitive impairment and forgetfulness, and it does not discuss any alternatives to nicotine patches. The study was funded by drug companies and tobacco makers, and the nicotine patches used in the study were provided by Pfizer. Overall, the article provides some details about the study design and how nicotine might improve memory, but it lacks information on costs, potential harms, alternatives to nicotine patches, and conflict of interest issues.

The story tells of a child who resented their mother for having only one eye and being an embarrassment. The child even told their mother to die. However, later in life, the child becomes successful and has a family of their own. When the mother visits, the child yells at her and tells her to leave. Eventually, the child discovers a letter from their mother after her death, explaining that she gave up her eye for them when they lost theirs in an accident. The story ends with the child regretting their actions and realizing the love and sacrifice their mother made.

The article also mentions that the story has similarities to other legends about maternal love and sacrifice. It notes that modern medical technology does not allow for the transplantation of an eyeball, making the story fictional in that aspect. The article does not comment on the ethical implications of such a transplant.

Overall, the article summarizes the story of a mother who gave up her eye for her child and the child's realization of their mother's sacrifice after her death.

928,"### Context: A surge of parasitic sea lice is causing disruption in salmon farms around the world. These tiny lice attach themselves to salmon and feed on them, killing or rendering them unsuitable for consumption. This has led to an increase in wholesale prices of salmon, resulting in higher consumer prices. The lice have infested salmon farms in the US, Canada, Scotland, Norway, and Chile, which are major suppliers of salmon. The global aquaculture industry spends about $1 billion annually to control the pests. Scientists and fish farmers are working on new ways to combat the lice, including using pesticides and breeding for genetic resistance. Other innovative solutions being explored include bathing the salmon in warm water and using underwater lasers to zap the lice. Sea lice are considered the biggest threat to the salmon farming industry, making the fish more expensive for consumers. The spread of lice is difficult to control because they thrive in the tightly packed ocean pens used for fish farming. The lice can grow to the size of a pea and lay thousands of eggs in their short lifespan. Although the chance of a louse making its way to a diner's plate is small, salmon are checked for lice before being sent to market. The lice became a problem for fish farmers in Canada around 1994, and a pesticide called emamectin benzoate was used to control them. However, the lice developed resistance to the pesticide around 2009, leading to their global spread. The worldwide supply of salmon fell by almost 10% last year, with Norway being particularly affected. Norwegian farmers are considering using closed-in pens to prevent the escape of lice-infested fish into the wild. Scottish farmers have been using a device called a Thermolicer to warm the water and detach the lice from fish. Farmers in North America and Europe are experimenting with using ""cleaner fish"" to coexist with salmon and eat the lice. Research is also being conducted on farming salmon along with mussels, which eat larval sea lice. Underwater drones equipped with lasers have been used in Norway and Scotland to kill lice. Cooke Aquaculture, a major player in salmon farming, is using various methods to control lice, including breeding for disease resistance and using hydrogen peroxide baths. The salmon farming industry is investing in these innovations to combat the huge cost of sea lice.

929,"### Context: The article discusses the content of two emails sent by former NASA astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign director. The emails, which were part of the WikiLeaks release of Podesta's emails, discuss topics such as disclosure of information on UFOs, zero point energy, and the militarization of space.

In the first email, Mitchell requests a meeting with Podesta to discuss disclosure and zero point energy. He mentions his Catholic colleague Terri Mansfield, who would provide an update on the Vatican's awareness of extraterrestrial intelligence. Mitchell also mentions a new Space Treaty being worked on, involving Russia and China. He suggests pursuing another route for peace in space and zero point energy due to Russia's interference in Ukraine. Mitchell claims to have met with US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto to discuss zero point energy and believes she can be a resource in their presentation to President Obama.

The second email includes a brief introduction and links to articles discussing the militarization of space. Mitchell mentions his colleague Carol Rosin, who worked with Wernher von Braun, and provides a treaty on the prevention of weapons in outer space for Podesta's convenience. Mitchell warns that extraterrestrial intelligence will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.

The article also provides background information on the individuals involved. Mitchell was a NASA astronaut and a strong believer in metaphysical phenomena and the existence of extraterrestrial life. Mansfield, who runs a nonprofit focusing on metaphysical concepts, is mentioned as the owner of the email address from which the emails were sent. Rosin is described as the founder of the Institute for Security and Cooperation in Outer Space.

The emails discuss two loosely connected threads. The first is the discussion of adding the United States as a signatory to a treaty that would ban weapons in space. The second is the concept of zero point energy, which Mitchell's company, Quantrek, sought to harness. The connection between zero point energy and the space treaty is based on the belief that humans need to embrace peace and extraterrestrial beings in order to understand and implement zero point energy.

Overall, the emails reveal conversations between Podesta and Mitchell about the existence of aliens, alien technology, and space warfare.

In Mitchell’s and Mansfield’s view, there is a straight line connection between signing a stronger space treaty and receiving information from aliens about how to create a form of energy that will save our civilization. What does not emerge, however, is any evidence supporting the quasi-scientific claims made by Mitchell or Mansfield, or that the United States Government is privy to any information regarding those claims.","Wikileaks’ dump of John Podesta’s e-mails reveal conversations he had with a former NASA astronaut about the existence of aliens, alien technology, and space warfare.","What's true: The emails show that Edgar Mitchell, a former NASA astronaut, asked John Podesta to help him promote the idea that extraterrestrial beings exist and that they possess advanced technology.

The number comes from policyholders in October 2013 who received notices from the insurance company Florida Blue that their insurance plans didn't meet the new rules under the Affordable Care Act. However, the vast majority of the 300,000 found coverage with Florida Blue, leaving at most 60,000 people who lost their health insurance. Even that number is likely high, as the 20 percent who didn't remain with Florida Blue could have found another private plan or purchased insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. The use of the 300,000 number is misleading because it ignores the coverage gains of the Affordable Care Act in Florida. More than 1.7 million Floridians purchased plans through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces between November 2015 and February 2016. Additionally, the uninsured rate in Florida has decreased by one-third since 2013.

Burundanga, also known as Devil's Breath or the zombie drug, is derived from trees in South America and has been used in the medical community to prevent vomiting and motion sickness. However, it has gained a reputation as ""the world's scariest drug"" in the underworld drug trade. The drug can block the brain's ability to form memories and strip its victims of free will and reason for days. Reports of burundanga poisoning are common in South America, where criminals often use the drug to sexually assault or rob their victims. In 2013, a criminal group used handwritten notes laced with burundanga to poison four victims. However, there is no evidence of burundanga being used on victims in the United States or any other location outside of South America.

932,"### Context: Researchers have discovered a fabric that can kill coronaviruses, according to a Facebook post that has been widely shared. The fabric, known as electroceutical fabric, was developed in 2005 and is approved by the FDA as a wound dressing. It is sold by Vomaris under the name Procellera. In 2017, a study conducted by Chandan Sen demonstrated the fabric's effectiveness as an antimicrobial wound dressing. Now, Sen is applying the technology to combat COVID-19, with promising early results.

The electroceutical fabric consists of polyester printed with alternating silver and zinc metal dots in a geometric pattern. When exposed to moisture, these metals create microcell batteries that generate an electrical charge. The fabric disrupts the electrostatic forces that coronaviruses rely on to assemble themselves into an infective form and attach to a host. Preliminary research has shown that the fabric can neutralize the virus after just one minute of contact with the electrical field generated by the fabric.

Vomaris has applied through the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization program to use the fabric for COVID-19 face masks. The company is hoping to develop two products: a washable mask with a disposable electroceutical fabric layer and a one-time use mask. They aim to have these products on the market by the fall flu season.

The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to protect healthcare providers against COVID-19. However, the doffing of contaminated PPE can potentially spread infection. The electroceutical fabric could provide a solution to this problem.

While the initial research on the fabric's effectiveness against coronaviruses is promising, it has not yet been peer-reviewed or approved by the FDA for this specific application. The company is working towards obtaining the necessary approvals and hopes to release the fabric in antiviral face masks later this year.

933,"### Context: A U.S. District Judge in North Carolina has ruled that a state law requiring doctors to perform an ultrasound and describe the fetus to women seeking abortions is unconstitutional. The judge found that the law violated the First Amendment by compelling doctors to deliver the state's ideological message in favor of carrying a pregnancy to term. The law required that an ultrasound image be presented and the sound of the fetal heartbeat be offered at least four hours before an abortion, but women were free to look away and ignore the explanation. The ultrasound requirement had been blocked by the judge a few months after it was passed due to concerns over the ""non-medical message"" doctors were required to deliver. The ruling was seen as a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, who filed a lawsuit challenging the law. Supporters of the law argued that it provided crucial information for women making a major decision, but the judge ruled that it was an ""egregious government intrusion"" into private medical decisions. North Carolina joined 25 other states that require pre-abortion counseling beyond basic medical ""informed consent"" when the law went into effect in 2011. It also became the tenth state to include the additional requirement of an ultrasound, which has faced legal challenges in several states. North Carolina has some of the strictest requirements for clinics performing abortions, including a requirement for doctors to be present during the procedure. The state also bans publicly funded health insurance programs from covering most abortions and authorizes state health officials to design rules for increased safety standards for abortion clinics. The ruling is seen as a setback for conservative lawmakers in the state who have been enacting laws to restrict abortion access in recent years.

934,"### Context: President Donald Trump has been a vocal supporter of hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for COVID-19. He recently announced that he has been taking the drug himself. However, there have been multiple studies that have cast doubt on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in treating the virus.

One study, conducted by researchers at the universities of South Carolina and Virginia, looked at 368 Veterans Administration (VA) patients with COVID-19. The study found that hydroxychloroquine had no effect on whether someone had to be put on a ventilator, and it actually increased the chances of dying. The patients involved in the study were all men over 65 with underlying health conditions.

Two larger studies conducted in New York City also found no association between hydroxychloroquine use and improved outcomes. One study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at the medical records of 1,376 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The results showed no lower chance of dying or needing a respirator for patients who received hydroxychloroquine.

Another study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) examined 1,438 randomly selected COVID-19 patients treated at 25 New York area hospitals. This study also found no connection between outcomes and the use of hydroxychloroquine.

Both studies acknowledged that working with patient records after the fact is not the final answer and called for more research. However, the results of these studies contradict Trump's claim that there was only one negative survey and that the patients receiving hydroxychloroquine were in very bad shape. In reality, the patients receiving the drug were not on the verge of death, and health issues were found in both the treatment and non-treatment groups.

Overall, the studies show that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the death toll or improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Despite Trump's endorsement of the drug, the Food and Drug Administration cautions that it can increase the risk of an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to cardiac arrest.

935,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that using cellular phones at gas stations can cause explosions. It mentions that warnings about this danger began circulating on the internet in 1999, citing incidents in which drivers suffered burns and their cars were severely damaged due to explosions caused by gasoline vapors ignited by sparks from mobile phones. The article also mentions that mobile phone makers like Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia include cautions in their user handbooks about using phones in gas stations and other locations with flammable substances.

However, the article states that there is no evidence to confirm these incidents. Oil companies and industry associations, such as the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association and the American Petroleum Institute, have denied the risk of mobile phones causing explosions at gas stations. The article also mentions that no documentation could be found to support claims of incidents where mobile phones ignited fumes during fueling operations.

While experts acknowledge the potential danger of using mobile phones near gas pumps, no real-life instances of explosions caused by cell phones have been found. The article mentions that gas pumps in various countries have cautionary stickers or bans on mobile phone use, but these measures are more of a precautionary nature rather than a response to a documented hazard.

Cellular phone manufacturers like Nokia and Ericsson acknowledge the small risk but recommend turning off phones while refueling. However, it is unclear how a cellular phone could trigger an explosion, as the voltage and current of cellular phone batteries are lower than those of automobile batteries.

The article concludes that news reports often attribute gas pump fires to cell phone use, but later investigations reveal that other factors, such as static electricity, were the actual cause.

936,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Tim Pawlenty during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press in 2011. Pawlenty stated that there is no scientific conclusion that being gay is genetic. The article explains that Pawlenty's word choice is important in evaluating the accuracy of his claim. If he had said that there is no scientific conclusion that being gay is biological, he would have been incorrect. The article explains that being genetic means that a trait comes from the genes encoded in DNA, while being biological means that it can stem from various factors such as hormone levels or fetal development.

The article goes on to discuss studies on sexual orientation, particularly twin studies. These studies show that being gay is not exclusively determined by genes, but there is a genetic component. The studies also suggest that sexual orientation is resistant to social and environmental factors. The American Psychological Association states that no specific factor or factors have been found to determine sexual orientation, but the evidence for biological contributions is strong.

The article acknowledges that there is no solid scientific consensus on the causes of female homosexuality, as research on this topic has been limited. Therefore, the discussion in the article primarily focuses on gay men.

In conclusion, the article states that Pawlenty's claim that there is no scientific conclusion that being gay is genetic is accurate. However, it clarifies that this does not mean there is no biological cause for sexual orientation. Most scientists believe that sexual orientation is caused by biology rather than choice.

938,"### Context: Malaysia has reported its first case of polio in 27 years. The case involves an infant from Tuaran town in Sabah state who tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus type 1. The baby was hospitalized with fever and muscle weakness and is currently on respiratory support, but in stable condition. The Health Minister, Dzulkefly Ahmad, stated that tests showed the baby's strain had genetic links to the polio virus detected in the Philippines. Investigations are ongoing to determine the cause of the infection.

Malaysia's last polio case occurred in 1992, and the country was declared polio-free in 2000. The health ministry believes that the strain originated from a weakened virus contained in the oral polio vaccine, which was excreted from the body through feces and possibly spread in an unsanitary environment to those who haven't been immunized. Malaysia switched from oral vaccine to inactivated polio vaccine in 2008, which is given to children via injection in combination with other vaccines for infectious diseases.

The government fully halted the use of the oral vaccine three years ago, and there have been no reports of vaccine-derived polio cases from the use of over 80 million doses of the oral vaccine. However, investigations showed that 25 out of 204 children in the infant's home village were not vaccinated against polio. These children, who are non-citizens, have now been given polio vaccines. Vaccination efforts are being expanded to other risky areas to prevent transmission.

Health officers are also educating villagers about polio and preventive measures. Tests have been carried out on those close to the infant and from the environment, and so far, wastewater samplings from six sewage treatment plants in Sabah have shown no presence of wild polio virus or vaccine-derived strains. Surveillance is being bolstered to detect those with muscle paralysis, a symptom of polio, although no cases have been detected so far.

Polio has no known cure and can only be prevented with vaccines. The World Health Organization states that polio remains endemic in only Pakistan and Afghanistan, with Malaysia becoming the second Asian country to report a polio case after the recent outbreak in the Philippines.

939,"### Context: Hillary Clinton's claim that in Iran in 1979, extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy is broadly correct, according to several scholars who have studied the region. The revolution began in the late 1970s due to discontent among Iranians about Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's autocratic rule and his feared secret police. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an exiled cleric living in Paris, gained support among critics of the Shah. After strikes and protests, the Shah left for an ""extended vacation"" in January 1979, and Khomeini returned to Tehran in February 1979, leading to increased unrest. Supporters of Khomeini declared a revolutionary state in mid-February, and within two months, Khomeini won a national referendum. The revolution's supporters were not exclusively Islamist but included leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, democrats, and the moderately religious who were all against the Shah's regime. However, Khomeini and his followers actively worked to establish a theocratic state, which was opposed by many secular and even clerical revolutionaries. Initially, Khomeini had stated that he did not advocate clerical rule, but as the process to write Iran's Constitution began in the fall of 1979, his followers introduced a process to vet candidates' credentials, allowing them to manipulate future elections. Iran became fully Islamist in October 1981 when the cleric Ali Khamenei won the third presidential election. Experts agree that Clinton's claim is generally correct, although they quibble with the use of the word ""hijacked"" and the compressed time frame she used. The changes in Iran did not happen immediately in 1979 but played out over two years after the Shah's fall. Overall, Clinton's claim accurately reflects the broad-based nature of the revolution and the establishment of a brutal theocracy by extremists.

### Explanation:
",true,"Clinton said that ""in Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."" She’s generally correct, experts say, despite questions over whether ""hijacked"" is the right word and whether she used an overly broad time frame.","In Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy.","Clinton said, """"In Iran in 1979, the extremists hijacked the broad-based popular revolution against the Shah and established a brutal theocracy."""" Clinton’s claim is broadly correct. The revolution was indeed broad-based, with supporters not exclusively Islamist but including leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, moderately religious and others who were all against the Shah. The theocracy was established by the followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who returned to Iran in 1979 after 15 years in exile. Khomeini and his followers actively worked to establish a theocratic state, a goal that was opposed by many of the secular and even clerical revolutionaries. The changes in Iran did not happen immediately in 1979, but played out over two years after the Shah’s fall. Clinton’s use of the word """"hijacked"""" and her compressed time frame are the only quibbles we have with her claim. Correction: This article was updated to correct the spelling of Ali Khamenei's name."

The child contracted measles earlier this month and was not infectious while at school. It is not connected to three previously confirmed cases in Connecticut reported in January and April. Health Commissioner Renée Coleman-Mitchel said the best protection against the highly contagious disease is vaccination. New data released this week showed immunization rates for measles, mumps and rubella among kindergarten students in Connecticut has continued to decline in more schools. Democratic State Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, who supports eliminating the state’s religious exemption for immunizations, said Friday it is imperative the state increase vaccination rates.

941,"### Context: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has stated that she supports Superintendent Eddie Johnson's decision to request an internal affairs investigation following an incident where he was found asleep in his car at a stop sign. Mayor Lightfoot believes that the investigation will assure the public that Johnson is not trying to hide anything about his actions. The Chicago Police Department spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, has stated that there were no signs of impairment observed by the officers who responded to the 911 call reporting the incident. However, Guglielmi also mentioned that the question of impairment can only be answered by the internal affairs investigation.

Johnson explained that he had been driving home after letting his driver go home to his family when he felt lightheaded and decided to pull over and fall asleep. The responding officers found Johnson slumped over but allowed him to drive home without administering a breathalyzer or field sobriety test. Johnson stated that such tests are only conducted when a motorist appears impaired or when officers detect the smell of alcohol or cannabis. He attributed the incident to not following his doctor's orders regarding medication for his high blood pressure.

Mayor Lightfoot acknowledged that Johnson has had medical issues in the past, including a kidney transplant and hospitalization for a blood clot. She stated that she has no reason to doubt his account of what happened and believes that his recent change in medication may have contributed to the incident. Lightfoot also mentioned that she knows certain medications can have side effects based on her experience with her parents.

The investigation into Johnson's incident will be handled by the public integrity unit within the department's internal affairs division. This unit consists of officers detailed to the FBI's Chicago office. Guglielmi emphasized that if there is any indication of impropriety, the case will be referred to outside investigative agencies.

Superintendent Eddie Johnson has been working to restore public confidence in the Chicago Police Department following the release of a dashcam video in 2015 showing the fatal police shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. Johnson wants to take steps to assure the public that his account of the incident is accurate.

Overall, Mayor Lightfoot supports the internal affairs investigation and believes that Johnson's medical issues and recent change in medication may have contributed to the incident. The investigation will be conducted by the public integrity unit, and if any impropriety is found, it will be referred to outside investigative agencies.

942,"### Context: A study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that paying patients and doctors cash incentives can significantly improve medication adherence. The study involved four patient groups, with the group that received incentives for both patients and doctors showing the greatest improvement in blood cholesterol levels. This group experienced a drop of 33.6 points in LDL cholesterol, compared to a drop of 25.1 points in the group that received no money. The study also used electronic pill bottles that sent a signal when opened, allowing researchers to monitor medication adherence.

However, the article raises questions about the practicality and cost of implementing such a program. It highlights the need to analyze whether the amounts paid in the study, up to $1,024 over a year, would be worth it in terms of avoiding the costs of treating heart attacks and strokes. The article also mentions the potential limitations of the pay-for-taking-meds approach, such as patients potentially discontinuing medication after the payment stage.

The story acknowledges the importance of quantifying the drops in cholesterol but suggests that it would be valuable to know if the incentives actually translated into increased medication adherence. It also discusses the downsides associated with the pay-for-taking-meds approach, including the side effects of the medications themselves.

The article emphasizes that paying cash to patients to take medicine is an experimental idea and not something that local doctors are likely to offer. However, it could have provided more information on the prevalence and contexts in which this approach is being used. The story mentions that paying both patients and physicians to improve compliance is what makes this study novel, but it could have been clearer about other studies looking at patient financial incentives.

Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the study, including its methods, comparison, and limitations. It includes perspectives from researchers not involved in the study and a patient advocate in the field. The story is commended for addressing the cost trade-offs and providing important context.

943,"### Context: The article debunks a claim made by the far-right blog Big League Politics that FBI agent Peter Strzok II had a covert CIA background and was involved in a ""deep state"" plot to sabotage President Trump's presidency. The claim stated that Strzok grew up in Iran, had a father who engaged in clandestine activities, served as a ""Middle East intel operative"" in the Obama administration, and was placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

The article provides evidence to refute these claims. It states that Strzok was born in 1970, not the late 1960s as claimed, and that his father's name is Peter Strzok Sr., not Peter Strzok II. The article also clarifies that there is no evidence of a Peter Strzok III. While Strzok did spend part of his childhood in Iran and attended the American School in Tehran, the claim that he ""grew up"" in Iran is an overstatement. The Strzok family left Iran in 1979 due to political unrest. It is unclear whether they moved to Saudi Arabia, but they did relocate to Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) in Africa, where Strzok Sr. worked for Catholic Relief Services.

The article also debunks the claim that Strzok had a covert CIA background and served as a ""Middle East intel operative"" in the Obama administration. It states that there is no evidence to support these claims and that as an FBI counterintelligence officer, it is unlikely that Strzok would have played such a role. The article also refutes the claim that Strzok was placed in the FBI to ensure a win for Hillary Clinton, stating that he joined the agency in 1996, long before the 2016 presidential election.

Overall, the article concludes that the claims made by Big League Politics are unfounded and based on misinterpretations of public documents and a labored effort to connect dots that do not exist. It suggests that the purpose of these claims is to create a conspiracy theory around Strzok and his alleged involvement in a ""deep state"" plot.
Claim: FBI agent Peter Strzok II grew up in Iran; had a father who engaged in clandestine activities overseas under the guise of doing charitable work; served as a ""Middle East intel operative"" in the Obama administration; and was a CIA agent ""placed"" in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency.
The claim veracity: unproven

There is no evidence nor any good reason to suppose that he acted as an “envoy” or “intel operative” in U.S. dealings with Iran at any time during the Obama administration. And the claim that Strzok is or was a covert CIA operative “placed” in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency and subvert the Trump administration is a flight of fancy divorced from all evidence and logic.","FBI agent Peter Strzok II grew up in Iran; had a father who engaged in clandestine activities overseas under the guise of doing charitable work; served as a ""Middle East intel operative"" in the Obama administration; and was a CIA agent ""placed"" in the FBI to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency.","What's true: Peter Strzok's father, Peter Strzok Sr., worked for Catholic Relief Services in Iran, Burkina Faso, and elsewhere.

While Carson was not an employee of the company, he delivered paid speeches for them and appeared in promotional videos. In these speeches and videos, Carson spoke highly of Mannatech's products and their benefits. He even mentioned his personal use of the supplements and how they helped alleviate his symptoms during cancer treatment. Although Carson claims he is not an official spokesperson or sales associate for Mannatech, he does refer people to the company. Mannatech also views Carson as a product promoter and has used his endorsement to its advantage. Carson's opinion on health issues carries weight due to his background as a renowned surgeon. It is worth noting that Carson's campaign has requested the removal of some videos and articles featuring him from Mannatech's website.

945,"### Context: The article discusses the benefits of taking a brisk, hour-long walk to counteract the negative effects of sitting for long periods of time. However, the author of the summary points out several issues with the article. 

Firstly, the author mentions that the article does not discuss the time cost involved in walking for an hour a day. Many people may struggle to find the time for exercise if it means less time for work or caregiving. Additionally, older adults may have medical problems that prevent them from exercising.

The author also criticizes the article for not providing any numbers or statistics. The article claims that sitting all day is as dangerous as being obese or smoking, but does not provide any evidence to support this statement. The author believes that the article should have mentioned the potential harms of engaging in a brisk walk, such as the risk of injury.

Furthermore, the author argues that the article inappropriately uses cause-and-effect language, stating that walking can ""reverse"" the damage of sitting. The author suggests that the article should have used language that indicates an association or link between walking and health effects, rather than making definitive claims.

The author also highlights the limitations of the study that the article is based on. The researchers themselves state that there may be bias in the results due to individuals with undiagnosed diseases that make them less likely to exercise. The author believes that the article should have discussed these limitations.

Lastly, the author notes that the article does not explain that the study is meant to address a specific issue that has generated conflicting results in previous research. The study aims to determine the role of physical activity in counteracting the negative effects of prolonged sitting.

Overall, the author of the summary criticizes the article for omitting important information, using misleading language, and not providing sufficient evidence to support its claims.
Claim: To reverse damage of sitting, take a brisk, hour-long walk
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story reports on a large meta-analysis of observational studies looking at the association between sedentary behavior (sitting and TV-watching), exercise, and risk of dying prematurely. Its main take-home message is “it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ‘moderate intensity’ exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day.” Although that’s a faithful account of how the study researchers frame their results, we think it’s likely to leave readers with a misleading impression. Despite what the researchers may claim, this type of study can’t prove that exercise can “undo the damage of sitting” — all it can do is show associations between these behaviors and risk of death. There are many factors, other than exercise and sedentary behavior, that affect one’s risk of death (e.g. diet, illnesses, socioeconomic factors), and the story didn’t explain that researchers can’t account for all of those factors in a study like this. Suggesting that exercise “reverses” the damage of sitting implies a certainty to the study’s conclusions that simply doesn’t exist. Every day, readers are bombarded with health news messages from observational studies such as this one relating to diet, exercise, and other lifestyle issues. Because this type of research is not definitive, it is liable to be contradicted by the next study that comes along, which in turn generates a new set of headlines that is in conflict with what readers just heard from the last study. This generates confusion among the public and mistrust of both scientists and journalists who can’t seem to get their stories straight. We offer tips for reporting on observational studies in our toolkit.","To reverse damage of sitting, take a brisk, hour-long walk","The story does a good job of explaining the potential harms of prolonged sitting, but it doesn’t give readers enough information to evaluate the evidence behind the headline.

She currently lives independently in an on-site apartment at Beloit Senior Living and is in almost perfect health. She participates in various activities such as exercise classes, book clubs, crafts, and happy hour. Makholm enjoys an occasional drink of gin and will be celebrating her birthday with a week of festivities in Suring, Wisconsin, including a special event at her church.

Makholm grew up in Chicago as an only child with a single mother, which was unusual for a Catholic family at the time. After marrying her husband Austin in 1941, they took over Hill View Jersey Farm in Suring. Makholm adjusted to rural life and became Lutheran. The farm gained notoriety for being the second highest producing Jersey herd for butterfat in Wisconsin. After 35 years, the Makholms sold the farm as their children did not want to continue farming.

Despite retiring from farming, Makholm continued to work various jobs, including as a CNA, receptionist, and in medical records. She even worked into her late 70s, only stopping when her doctor passed away. Makholm stayed busy during her retirement by acting as a general contractor for a new house, putting in a pond, shed, and island with a bridge. She also lived in a double-wide mobile home that she oversaw the construction of at age 86.

At age 98, Makholm decided it was time to consider moving and chose Beloit Senior Living, where she currently resides. She can share meals with other residents but maintains her independence by doing her own cleaning, taking her own medications, and running her apartment independently. Makholm keeps busy by participating in all activities and has made friends at the senior living facility.

947,"### Context: SeaWorld has released a new ad claiming that killer whales live just as long in captivity as they do in the wild. The ad is a response to criticism from animal rights group PETA, who argue that keeping killer whales in captivity is harmful to the animals and dangerous for the people who train them. SeaWorld's ad cites an independent study by Dr. Douglas DeMaster, a scientist at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which found that survival rates for captive and wild killer whales are about equal. However, PETA disputes this claim, citing their own documentation of captive whale deaths which shows that the average age of death for SeaWorld's female orcas is 12 years old, compared to an expected survival of 50 years in the wild. For males, the average age of death is 16, compared to an expected survival of 30 years in the wild. SeaWorld also highlights an Associated Press analysis which found that the average life expectancy for a killer whale born at SeaWorld is 46 years, close to the 49-year average life expectancy of a wild orca. However, critics argue that simply reaching parity with wild populations is not necessarily a major achievement, as captive animals do not have to worry about predators, food shortages, fishing nets, or pollution, and they receive better medical and nutritional care. The ad focuses on longevity, but experts argue that annual survival rates are a better measurement than longevity. They also note that the data on wild orca populations is limited and comparisons between captive and wild orcas are tenuous. Overall, the claim made by SeaWorld in their ad is an oversimplification of a complex issue, and experts argue that it does not take into account the quality of life for captive whales.

The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"A SeaWorld ad said ""whales live as long at SeaWorld"" as they do in the wild. At its core, this claim is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. Recent independent data suggests that survival rates for captive and wild orcas are about equal, but that by itself isn't all that significant, experts told us. The data is limited and comparisons between orcas in captivity and in the wild are tenuous. Experts also noted that logic suggests captive whales should live longer because they don't face predators and receive medical care, which makes SeaWorld's claim further misleading. Lastly, experts said that a simple measurement of survival rates (or lifespan) serves as a smokescreen from the more fundamental question of the conditions for whales in captivity. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.","Whales live as long at SeaWorld"" as they do in the wild.","SeaWorld’s ad makes a claim that is at best an oversimplification of a complex issue.

948,"### Context: The article discusses the concept of ""Blue Monday,"" which is believed to be the most depressing day of the year. The idea originated in 2005 when a press release detailed a formula that calculated factors such as weather, debt, time since Christmas, and unsuccessful New Year's resolutions. This formula identified January 24, 2005, as the most depressing day of the year. However, many people regarded the claim as shaky because the factors were vague and difficult to quantify.

The formula was devised by Dr. Cliff Arnall of the University of Cardiff, who explained that the realization of post-holiday obligations and the dark clouds rolling in contribute to the feeling of depression. The formula was actually created to help a travel company analyze holiday trends and increase vacation sales. It was later revealed that the formula was a paid placement by a PR agency working on behalf of the travel company.

Over the years, the belief that one specific day in January is the most depressing has been recycled by various companies seeking to promote goods or services in the post-holiday period. The claim has also evolved from a formula based on circumstances to an analysis of negative language and phrases used in tweets. Researchers analyzed over 2 million tweets posted by Britons in January and found that there is a higher number of tweets relating to guilt, as people abandon their New Year's resolutions.

The article also mentions that mental health professionals and journalists have criticized Arnall for minimizing the issue of clinical depression. Despite the criticism, Arnall defended his involvement with PR-as-science and stated that he had no regrets. He has earned a total of £1,650 for identifying the most depressing and happiest days of the year.

In conclusion, while the concept of ""Blue Monday"" has been widely circulated, the claim that a specific date in January is statistically the most depressing day of the year is questionable. The original formula was created as a PR campaign for a travel company, and subsequent claims have been used by various companies for promotional purposes. Mental health professionals have criticized the concept for trivializing clinical depression.
Claim: Scientists have determined a date in January is statistically the most depressing day of the year.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:

The tweet containing this quote has been deleted and is not a genuine quote by Graham. No credible news reports have published the statement, and it cannot be found on any of the senator's social media pages. Graham did release a statement praising Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak, but he did not suggest that Trump knows more about the virus than medical professionals. The person who tweeted the quote, Dan Lyons, describes himself as an ""inventor of fake news."" However, this context is lost on people who viewed the tweet on other platforms.

950,"### Context: The article debunks a claim made by a blog post on Mr. Conservative that suggests President Obama has enacted a law requiring health care professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government, which is then used as justification for gun confiscation. The article clarifies that the claim is misleading and incorrect. 

The proposed rule in question aims to clarify privacy restrictions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regarding the sharing of certain information with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to screen potential gun purchasers. The information reportable to NICS does not include physicians' medical records about mental illness diagnoses, prescriptions, or treatment recommendations. Instead, it pertains to decisions made by courts, boards, commissions, or other lawful authorities regarding involuntary commitment to a mental institution.

The article emphasizes that the proposed rule does not require health care professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws or submit detailed treatment records to the government. It also highlights that the rule is not yet enacted and is currently in the comment phase, meaning it may not be implemented at all.

Regarding the claim of gun confiscation, the article acknowledges concerns that increasing the flow of mental health information to NICS could potentially lead to confiscation. However, experts argue that widespread gun confiscation is implausible and that the proposed rule strikes a reasonable balance between protecting public safety and respecting individual rights. They note that federal law already prohibits firearm possession by certain groups and that confiscation may occur in selected situations, such as domestic violence cases.

In conclusion, the claim made by Mr. Conservative that Obama has unconstitutionally enacted a law requiring health care professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government for gun confiscation is misleading and incorrect. The proposed rule aims to clarify privacy restrictions under HIPAA and does not involve routine diagnostic data compiled by health care professionals. Experts argue that widespread gun confiscation is unlikely.

The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The post we’re checking said that, ""according to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government,"" which is ""then used as justification for gun confiscation."" The elements of this claim range from misleading to flat-out wrong. The one area of reasonable concern is that some jurisdictions may lack full due process for declaring someone mentally incompetent, potentially putting some people at risk of seeing their guns confiscated. But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible. The rule isn’t a law, it isn’t enacted and it isn’t unconstitutional according to Supreme Court jurisprudence. It isn’t a requirement, and it doesn’t involve routine diagnostic data compiled by ""health care professionals"" such as doctors.","According to (Barack) Obama’s newest unconstitutionally enacted law, health care professionals are now required to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government,"" which is ""then used as justification for gun confiscation.","A blog post on Mr. Conservative claimed that President Obama has enacted a law requiring health care professionals to violate HIPAA privacy laws and submit medical data to the government, which is then used as justification for gun confiscation.

951,"### Context: The claim that Craig Shergold is real and alive is supported by the article. In 1989, a campaign was started on Craig's behalf to break the Guinness world record for greeting cards. The Make-A-Wish Foundation had no involvement in this campaign. Craig, who was 9 years old at the time, had been diagnosed with a brain tumor after complaining of earaches. Despite surgery to remove the tumor, it continued to grow and his prognosis was not good.

The staff at Royal Marsden Hospital in London noticed that get-well cards cheered Craig up, so they suggested starting a card project to break the Guinness world record. The Children's Wish Foundation in London got involved, and the British press helped spread the story. Craig broke the previous record of a million cards within a few months, but the cards kept coming. However, a rumor started that Craig wanted business cards instead of greeting cards, which led to an overwhelming amount of mail. Craig's family eventually had to stop mail delivery to their home and move to a different residence. Over 350 million pieces of mail have been received at Craig's old address, and the stamps are sold to raise funds for cancer research.

The Guinness World Records have retired the greeting card category due to Craig's overwhelming response. Despite being overwhelmed by the volume of mail, Craig and his family were grateful for the visibility it brought. Virginia billionaire John Kluge learned about Craig's condition and arranged for him to be flown to the U.S. for life-saving surgery at the University of Virginia Medical Center. A PAX-TV movie about Craig was made, thanks to producer Robert Woods sending a card to Craig after hearing the rumor. The movie aims to help quiet the rumor and tell Craig's story as a healthy young man.

In conclusion, the article confirms that Craig Shergold is a real person who, at the age of 9, started a campaign to break the Guinness world record for greeting cards. The Make-A-Wish Foundation was not involved in this campaign. Craig's story gained significant visibility, leading to a large volume of mail being sent to his address. Despite the overwhelming response, Craig's family found a positive aspect in the visibility, as it ultimately led to life-saving surgery for Craig and the production of a movie about his story.

952,"### Context: Mexican Ambassador Óscar Ricardo Valero has resigned after being accused of stealing a book from an airport shop. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador described the case as ""painful"" and ""sad"". Valero's resignation was initially attributed to health reasons, with Mexico's Foreign Relations Secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, stating that Valero was undergoing neurological treatment. However, it was later revealed that Valero allegedly attempted to take a T-shirt without paying from a shop at the airport when he was called back to Mexico in December. Mexican news media reported that Valero had been diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2012, which resulted in behavioral changes. Although the tumor was surgically removed, a doctor's letter stated that recent behavior changes, including traffic tickets and difficulties in personal relationships, suggest that the tumor or its after-effects may have returned or worsened. A video of an incident earlier this year showed Valero allegedly tucking a book worth $9.50 into a stack of papers he was holding and being stopped by security after passing a detector gate. This incident is particularly embarrassing for President López Obrador, who has made promoting honesty among public servants a key policy aim.

954,"### Context: In January 2019, Second Lady Karen Pence faced criticism for taking a job as a part-time art teacher at Immanuel Christian School in Northern Virginia, a school that reportedly bars LGBT teachers and students. The controversy arose from two documents posted on the school's website. The first document is an employment application that requires potential staff to sign a commitment not to engage in homosexual sexual activity, transgender identity, or any violation of the unique roles of male and female. The document does not explicitly prohibit teachers from being gay, lesbian, or bisexual, but rather prohibits them from engaging in homosexual sexual activity. The second document is a parent agreement that requires parents to support the school's biblical morality and standards of conduct, including not supporting, condoning, or promoting homosexual or bisexual activity. Although the documents do not explicitly ban gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals from attending or working at the school, it could be seen as an implicit ban on openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals. The school reserves the right to refuse admission or expel a student if they or their parents engage in, support, condone, or promote homosexual or bisexual activity. The document cites a verse from the book of Leviticus as the scriptural basis for its ban on the promotion or support of homosexual acts. It is unclear whether Karen Pence signed and agreed to these documents or whether she views them as a ban on LGBT staff, parents, and students. The White House and Immanuel Christian School did not respond to requests for comment on this matter.
Claim: In January 2019, Second Lady Karen Pence began working as a teacher at a school that bans LGBT teachers and students.

955,"### Context: The article discusses the claim that Coca-Cola is an effective contraceptive. In 1985, three Harvard researchers conducted a study to verify the claims about Coke's contraceptive properties. They found that Diet Coke was the most effective spermicide, and the original formula Coke was also quite effective, five times more so than the reformulated ""new"" Coke. However, they warned against using soft drinks as douches after intercourse to prevent pregnancy, as all soft drinks fail as effective contraceptives.

Later experiments by medical researchers in Taiwan contradicted the Harvard study's findings. They found that cola, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, had little to no spermicidal effect. They concluded that even if cola had a spermicidal effect, its potency was relatively weak compared to other well-known spermicidal agents. They also cautioned against using cola as a postcoital douche, as it could be ineffective and cause complications such as infection.

The article highlights that spermicides themselves are not very effective at preventing pregnancy. It mentions that using Diet Coke as a spermicide is like using a rubber glove as a balloon, as neither method should be interpreted as a reliable form of contraception.

The article also discusses the historical use of Coca-Cola as a contraceptive. In the 1950s and 1960s, douching with Coke was a popular method of contraception due to its availability and affordability. However, this method was not very effective, and douching with any liquid is often ineffective in preventing pregnancy.

The article concludes by mentioning a 1992 study conducted by Nigerian researchers. They found that Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were ineffective as spermicides, but Krest bitter lemon drink showed potential as a contraceptive. They recommended further study to determine its effectiveness.

Overall, the article presents conflicting findings regarding the spermicidal properties of Coca-Cola. While the initial Harvard study suggested that certain formulations of Coke could have a spermicidal effect, subsequent studies did not confirm these results. The article emphasizes that using soda pop douches as a contraceptive method is ineffective and can lead to complications.

The author uses news clippings from 2005 to argue that there were instances of disruption and conflict inside town hall meetings, contrary to Krugman's assertion that the protests were only taking place outside the events. The author provides examples of heckling, booing, and shouting matches that occurred during town hall meetings hosted by members of Congress. Republican leaders at the time were reportedly rattled by the protests and decided to hold lower-profile events to avoid further disruption. The article also mentions that the movement against changing Social Security was aggressive and vowed to get in the faces of those supporting privatization. The author concludes that while the recent protests may be more intense, there was plenty of disruption inside town hall meetings in 2005, contradicting Krugman's claim.

957,"### Context: The article discusses a viral video that shows a piece of raw meat twitching off a dinner table, commonly referred to as the ""zombie chicken"" video. The video first circulated on Chinese social media sites in June 2019 and later reached English outlets. However, Hong Kong News identified the animal in the video as a recently skinned frog. While the sources may not have first-hand knowledge, it is suggested to take their claims with caution.

The video shows a fresh cut of meat, and although the animal is dead, its neurons are still active and seem to be reacting to sodium ion, which can be found in salt and soy sauce. Scientific American explains that when a creature dies, its neurons continue to work as long as there is enough energy to maintain the membrane potential. Salt, which is rich in sodium ions, can trigger the still-working neurons to fire, causing the muscles to contract. A similar video from 2009 demonstrates how salt can make a raw piece of meat twitch.

The article further explains that the twitching of dead animals occurs because the cells inside them are still intact and the biochemical machinery still functions. The muscles have a source of energy in the form of unused ATP molecules stored in the cells. All they need is something to activate them, which in this case is the sodium in the salt. The article suggests that the video was likely filmed at a restaurant practicing ikizukuri, a method of preparing live seafood. This method is commonly used with fish but can also be used with octopus, shrimp, lobster, and frogs.

The article mentions a previous incident in 2012 where a video showing the preparation of live frog sashimi went viral, causing controversy. The video depicted a frog being stabbed, skinned, gutted, and served on a plate while still moving. Although the details of the ""zombie chicken"" or ""zombie frog"" video cannot be confirmed, it is considered plausible based on the information provided.

In summary, the article discusses a viral video showing a piece of raw meat twitching off a dinner table, commonly referred to as the ""zombie chicken"" video. It explains that the twitching is caused by the still-active neurons reacting to sodium ions in salt. The video is suggested to be filmed at a restaurant practicing ikizukuri, a method of preparing live seafood.

958,"### Context: According to a report from the Utah Department of Health, planned home births accounted for 2.12 percent of all births in Utah in 2013, which is double the national average of less than 1 percent. This higher rate is influenced by the Mormon culture in Utah, which tends to have larger families. The study found that women who had planned home births in Utah were more likely to be 35 or older, have education beyond high school, be married, and have other children.

Interest in home birth has been growing since the 1970s, but has recently increased due to movies like ""The Business of Being Born"" and social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Midwife Eve German, who practices in Salt Lake City, carries high-tech medical equipment in her car and quickly transfers women to a hospital if complications arise during a home birth. She emphasizes that home birth is not suitable for women with more complicated or higher-risk pregnancies, such as twins or breech positions.

A Salt Lake City mother, Summer Curry, chose a home birth because she wanted to have her baby without pain medication or medical interventions. She gave birth in an inflatable birthing tub and appreciated the comfort and lack of rush to the hospital. The report found that in low-risk pregnancies, the health of babies born at home compared well to babies born in hospitals, although home-birth babies tended to score slightly lower on health exams given five minutes after birth. The long-term implications of this difference are unclear and require further study, especially considering the relatively high rate of home births in Utah.

The report analyzed birth-certificate data from 205,486 births among Utah mothers between 2010 and 2013, of which 3,701 were home births. It did not include birthing centers or babies accidentally born at home.

959,"### Context: The article discusses a study that explores the potential of barbershops in helping to lower blood pressure in African-American men. The study involved 319 African-American men with high blood pressure who were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. In the intervention group, barbers were trained to measure blood pressure and provide lifestyle advice, while also encouraging participants to follow up with a pharmacist who prescribed medication if necessary. The control group received standard health education.

The results of the study showed that men in the intervention group experienced a much greater reduction in their blood pressure readings compared to the control group. Among those who received the intervention, 63.6% achieved a blood pressure level of less than 130/80, compared to only 11.7% in the control group.

The article mentions that the study had some limitations, such as the fact that it was conducted in the Los Angeles area and may not be applicable to other locations. It also highlights the need for a national study to further evaluate the approach's effectiveness.

The story includes comments from a barber-participant in the study and a researcher unconnected to the project. It discusses the alternative of not receiving special help at the barbershop and mentions similar efforts to help black men at risk of colon cancer.

The article does not mention the costs of the antihypertensive drugs used in the study, nor does it disclose that study participants received vouchers for monthly haircuts and a small monetary payment to offset the costs of drugs and transportation. However, the article states that this information is not considered important for readers in this case.

The article acknowledges that there were risks associated with the study, as three individuals experienced acute kidney injury, although the problem disappeared once medications were altered. It suggests that the story would have been stronger if it had included these risks.

Overall, the article discusses the study in the context of previous research that has used barber shops and beauty salons as places to deliver health messages. It provides a balanced view of the study's findings and limitations, and does not appear to rely on a news release.
Claim: How barbershops could help lower blood pressure
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This well-written CNN story describes a multi-year study that looked at whether providing blood pressure screening and access to pharmacists in black-owned barber shops might be effective in reducing high blood pressure among the African-American men who patronize these establishments. The study was presented as part of the 67th annual scientific session of the American Association of Cardiologists. The story is strong and scores well because it discusses critical data from the study, offers comments from independent sources and provides information on limitations. It didn’t delve into either costs or harms, but in this case, there seems to be minimal need for either, due to the nature of the research. One minor point we think the story could have made: It remains to be seen if this style of intervention ultimately leads to a reduced risk of stroke, serious heart disease, and/or heart attacks, especially if there is not a long-term barbershop program in place. This was a unique choice for a study presented at the ACC conference. Often, the studies presented at the conference are industry-funded and focus on specific (and often very expensive) drugs or devices. We were heartened to see the news media give this study broad coverage, and found this story especially refreshing to read.",How barbershops could help lower blood pressure,"This story reports on a study that found that African-American men who received help in lowering their blood pressure at their local barbershop had better results than those who received standard health education.

960,"### Context: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is launching a $115 million campaign targeting 10 million young people aged 12 to 17 who are open to trying cigarettes or already experimenting with them. The goal of the campaign, called ""The Real Cost,"" is to reduce the number of youth cigarette smokers by at least 300,000 within three years. The campaign will focus on marginalized youngsters who may be turning to tobacco as a way of coping with poor or stressful lives. The ads will address typical teenage issues such as appearance and the desire for independence. The campaign will include print, TV, and radio ads, as well as billboards and bus stops. 

The ads were created by the advertising agency DraftFCB and have been rigorously tested with the target audience. One series of ads features a bully demanding money, highlighting the idea that smoking is like being controlled by a bully. Another series of ads focuses on the cosmetic damage cigarettes can cause, with one TV ad showing a young girl peeling off a piece of skin from her face to pay for cigarettes. The FDA plans to monitor 8,000 young people over two years to measure changes in attitudes toward tobacco and behavior before and after the campaign's launch.

Each day, over 3,200 people under the age of 18 try their first cigarette, and over 700 become daily smokers. Ninety percent of adult smokers start smoking before the age of 18, which is why early intervention is critical. The campaigns are expected to cost $400 million in total and are being funded by fees paid to the FDA by the tobacco industry. The FDA is also expected to extend its regulatory authority to electronic cigarettes and cigars, with proposed regulations currently under review by the White House's Office of Management and Budget.

However, the article criticizes the lack of cost estimates provided in the study, as the drug could potentially be very expensive. The article also highlights the need for clearer explanations of the study's results, as well as the potential side effects of the drug. It mentions that the study was funded by the drugmakers of erenumab, Amgen and Novartis, and that the first draft of the study was written by a company-funded writer. The article suggests that the story should have compared the effectiveness of erenumab with other migraine treatments and mentioned another migraine study reported in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine involving a different drug called fremanezumab. The article also criticizes the lack of clarity regarding the availability of erenumab and the potential pitfalls that may arise before its approval. It concludes by pointing out that the quotes from the principal investigator of the study were actually from a press release by King's College London, and not directly from the investigator himself. Overall, the article suggests that while the study on erenumab is promising, there are several important aspects that were not adequately addressed in the reporting.
Claim: Migraine drug could halve the length of attacks, study shows
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The Guardian covers a new phase III clinical trial of erenumab, a drug injected monthly, designed to reduce the frequency of painful migraines. The piece does a good job putting the results into context and even compares those findings to the placebo group, giving them a more transparent and helpful context. However, readers would have appreciated being told more of the basics. What are the possible side effects? How much might the drug cost? How is this different from other migraine treatments? Many news organizations used more sensational “breakthrough” language than The Guardian did in this story. But this was still only half a loaf, inexplicably reporting on one migraine study in the New England Journal of Medicine without even mentioning or linking to another migraine study in the same journal with a somewhat similar antibody agent. Why? About one in four US homes and perhaps 12% of the US population (much of it female) experiences migraines, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions of people each year. There’s no cure-all for the severe headaches, and current treatments and preventative drugs can cause unwanted side effects like tiredness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, heart rate issues, and more. So any alternative that is both effective and safe would be good news. But, as Dr. Richard Lehman wrote on his terrific BMJ blog, “the real worry is that antibodies beget antibodies, and we don’t know how long these (drugs) will remain effective or what long-term harms they might have.” And The Guardian story didn’t adequately address either concern.","Migraine drug could halve the length of attacks, study shows","This story reports on a study of a new drug for migraine headaches. The story does a good job of describing the design of the study and the benefits reported. However, the story should have mentioned the potential side effects of the drug, which include injection site pain, constipation, muscle weakness, and fatigue. The story also should have mentioned that the study was funded by the drugmakers of erenumab, Amgen and Novartis, and that the first draft of the study was written by a company-funded writer. The story should have compared the effectiveness of erenumab with other migraine treatments. The story also should have mentioned another migraine study reported in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine involving a different drug, fremanezumab. The story should have mentioned that the availability of erenumab is uncertain. The story also should have mentioned the potential pitfalls that may arise before its approval. The story also should have mentioned that the quotes from the principal investigator of the study were actually from a press release by King’s College London, not directly from the investigator. Migraine headaches are a common problem, affecting about 13 percent of U.S. adults and costing an estimated $31 billion in direct and indirect costs in the U.S. in 2013."
962,"### Context: A new chemotherapy drug called eribulin may provide benefits for some breast cancer patients, according to a study published in The Lancet. The study found that patients who took eribulin lived a median of 2.5 months longer than those who received a physician-chosen treatment. However, the article does not discuss the cost of the drug. The most common side effects of eribulin were fatigue and depletion of white blood cells, which occurred in 54% of patients. Neuropathy, or numbness and pain caused by nerve damage, was the most common adverse event that caused women to drop out of the eribulin arm of the trial, with a 5% dropout rate. The article notes that the trial included women with metastatic breast cancer who had already undergone extensive chemotherapy treatments. The study design was criticized for including several different chemotherapies in the physician-chosen treatment group, making detailed comparisons with eribulin difficult. The article includes quotes from an independent expert and a related editorial, but fails to mention that the study was funded by the company that markets eribulin and that several of the study authors received grants or consultancy fees from the company. The article also does not mention that eribulin has received approval in the United States for patients who have previously been treated with at least two chemotherapies. The article establishes the novelty of eribulin by quoting from the study authors and an independent authority, who both express optimism about the drug's potential.
Claim: New Chemo Drug May Benefit Some Breast Cancer Patients
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The article clearly details the survival benefit of eribulin, but it fails to tell readers that the drug has been approved in the United States. It also fell short because it did not explain how much the drug costs or how often harms occurred in the study. Metastatic breast cancer becomes progressively more difficult to treat as various therapies become less effective. This study suggests that eribulin is the first single-agent chemotherapy that extended the survival time of women with metastatic breast cancer who had already been treated with two to five other chemotherapies. This study is likely to generate significant interest and may change clinical practice for metastatic patients.",New Chemo Drug May Benefit Some Breast Cancer Patients,This story reports on a study of a chemotherapy drug called eribulin that is used to treat metastatic breast cancer. The story does a good job of describing the benefits of eribulin and the side effects of the drug. The story could have been improved by including the cost of eribulin and by providing more detail about the study design. The story also should have mentioned that the study was funded by the company that markets eribulin and that several of the study authors received money from the company. The story would have been improved by including a more detailed comparison of eribulin with other chemotherapy drugs.
963,"### Context: The claim that THC will be removed from drug-test screenings starting on August 30th is true, but it only applies to residents of Oklahoma with valid medical-marijuana licenses. The law, known as Senate Bill 2612, was introduced in the Oklahoma legislature on February 4th and signed into law by Governor Kevin Stitt on March 14th. It states that no employer in Oklahoma can refuse to hire, discipline, discharge, or penalize an applicant or employee solely based on a positive test for marijuana components or metabolites, unless certain conditions are met. The law actually took effect on August 29th, 2019. However, it is important to note that this law only applies to a very specific subset of the American population, despite being shared across the country without these caveats.

965,"### Context: The article discusses a viral video that shows a sick and possibly starving polar bear on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic. The video was posted by photographer Paul Nicklen and gained widespread attention on social media and national news outlets. The bear in the video appears emaciated, with protruding bones and atrophied muscles, indicating starvation. The video was shared by National Geographic, which confirmed its authenticity.

The causes of the bear's condition are attributed to climate change and the diminishing Arctic ice sheets. Polar bears rely on the ice to access their main food source, seals. However, as the ice melts due to warming seawater and air, the number of seals available to polar bears decreases, leading to starvation. Baffin Island, where the video was filmed, is particularly at risk as polar bears depend on seasonal ice.

Dr. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International, suggests that while climate change may not be the direct or sole cause of the bear's demise, it will make starvation more likely for sick, injured, young, or old bears in the future. He explains that malnutrition is a major cause of death for polar bears, and factors such as old age, injury, disease, or limited success in obtaining prey can contribute to starvation.

Hunters from Inuit communities on Baffin Island express skepticism about linking the bear's condition to climate change. They believe the bear is sick rather than starving, as it would be able to move more if it were starving. They consider the bear's condition to be part of a normal cycle of injury or illness for some bears.

Overall, the video serves as a warning about the future of polar bears and their ability to find food due to the diminishing Arctic ice caused by climate change. While the exact cause of this bear's condition may be uncertain, the continued loss of sea ice will make starvation more likely for polar bears in the region.
Claim: A video shows a sick, possibly starving polar bear on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic.

967,"### Context: A study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers titled ""Missed Opportunities"" provides a state-by-state analysis of how many jobs would be created by expanding Medicaid. In Florida, the study predicts that expanding Medicaid would create 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. The study is part of the Obama administration's promotion of the Affordable Care Act, which includes the federal government covering the initial costs of Medicaid expansion. Democrats, including former Governor Charlie Crist, are using the study to criticize Governor Rick Scott for Florida's decision not to expand Medicaid. Florida's Republican-led Legislature opposes expanding Medicaid, but Scott now supports it. The study is based on the idea that as states expand Medicaid, new patients will access medical services they haven't in the past, leading to extra revenue for healthcare facilities and the hiring of new workers. The study focuses on short-term job growth and predicts that Medicaid expansion in Florida would lead to 63,800 cumulative ""job years"" between 2014 and 2017. However, the report acknowledges that access to Medicaid could cause some people to work less or not at all, while healthier individuals might work more. Other studies on expanding Medicaid in Florida have arrived at different numbers, with the Florida Hospital Association predicting 120,000 jobs each year over a decade and Moody's predicting 10,000 to 30,000 jobs. Experts generally agree that expanding Medicaid would lead to new jobs, but it is difficult to pinpoint an exact number. While the federal government would cover the initial expansion costs, states would have to contribute in later years, which could strain state budgets. Ultimately, the decision to expand Medicaid is a judgment call for elected officials, weighing the cost of expansion against the number of jobs it would provide.
Claim: Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Crist said, ""Expanding Medicaid would create 63k jobs."" A study released by the White House said federal dollars that Florida would have gotten to expand Medicaid would create 63,800 jobs between 2014 and 2017. Most of the health care experts we interviewed agreed that injecting billions of federal dollars into Florida for Medicaid would spark some job growth, but it’s difficult to pinpoint a number, particularly as there are other changes in the health care landscape.

968,"### Context: The article discusses the controversy surrounding the link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer. While most research finds no or weak link between the two, some women have sued Johnson & Johnson, the dominant producer of baby powder, claiming that it caused their ovarian cancer. The article explains that finding the cause of cancer is difficult, and it would be unethical to conduct a study asking women to use talcum powder and wait to see if it causes cancer. However, several studies have been conducted to investigate the potential link. The biggest prospective studies have found no connection between talcum powder applied to the genitals and ovarian cancer. However, smaller look-back studies have found a modest connection, with a 20 to 40 percent increased risk among talc users. Despite this, there is no definitive proof that talc causes cancer. One large study even found that genital talc users had a reduced risk of ovarian cancer compared to non-users. Experts in the field have differing opinions on the matter. Dr. Hal C. Lawrence III, vice president of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, believes that if there were a true link, large studies would have verified the results of the smaller studies. The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society also state that there is not a clear connection between talc and ovarian cancer. The article also mentions the mixed results in court cases related to talc and ovarian cancer. While some juries have found Johnson & Johnson liable, others have thrown out the lawsuits. Johnson & Johnson plans to fight every lawsuit, claiming that the science supporting the link between talc and ovarian cancer is lacking. The article concludes by stating that the risk for any individual woman, if there is one, is likely very small.
Claim: Research finds talc doesn’t cause cancer; juries disagree.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,Two lawsuits ended in jury verdicts worth $127 million.

969,"### Context: The claim that boiling menstrual pads and drinking the water to get ""high"" or ""drunk"" is an alarming new trend amongst Indonesian teens is a mixture of grim factual realities, exaggerations, speculations, and falsehoods. While there have been reports of Indonesian teenagers using sanitary pads to get high, it is not a widespread trend. The practice is generally found in slums and mining areas and is associated with child poverty in the poorest parts of Indonesia.

The chemicals in the sanitary pads give those who drink the resulting concoction a feeling of ""flying"" and hallucinations, according to the Indonesian National Drug Agency. However, the exact ingredients used in sanitary pads are generally considered proprietary, so it is unclear which chemicals these children are exposing themselves to by drinking the boiled remains. Testing has detected low concentrations of toxic chemicals with potential neurological side effects in some brands of sanitary pads.

The claim that children are boiling soiled and bloody menstrual pads to get high is harder to verify. While there have been reports of children using soiled pads for this purpose in the past, it is unclear if this is still the case. The only on-the-record, first-hand account of using sanitary pads for inebriation is from a 14-year-old boy in 2016 who described buying unsoiled pads.

The phenomenon of Indonesian children using sanitary pads to get inebriated is a reflection of poverty and is not a widespread trend. It is a practice that has been observed in certain areas and is generally found among street children. The use of soiled pads, if it occurs, would be an extreme reflection of poverty.

In conclusion, while there have been reports of Indonesian teenagers using sanitary pads to get high, it is not a widespread trend. The practice is associated with child poverty in certain areas and is not supported by concrete evidence. The claim of a ""new trend"" is a mixture of factual realities, exaggerations, speculations, and falsehoods.

970,"### Context: Former United States Labor Secretary Robert Reich tweeted that Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was building a mansion in Washington, DC while part-time Whole Foods workers lost their health benefits. Reich's tweet mentioned that Bezos' mansion would have 25 bathrooms, two elevators, 1,006 light fixtures, and a movie theater. In June 2017, Amazon acquired Whole Foods, and in August 2017, it became the parent company of the supermarket chain. Whole Foods confirmed that it would stop offering healthcare benefits to some part-time workers starting January 1, 2020. The company stated that this change was to create a more equitable and efficient scheduling model. The affected employees would be provided with resources to find alternative healthcare coverage options. However, all Whole Foods employees would continue to receive employment benefits, including a 20% in-store discount. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International President criticized Amazon's decision, stating that it devalued and degraded grocery jobs. Bezos' mansion in Washington, DC was reported to have 25 bathrooms, two elevators, and a movie theater. The architectural plans for the mansion were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Bezos also owned properties in Manhattan, Washington State, Texas, and California. In summary, Reich's tweet accurately highlighted the construction of Bezos' mansion and the discontinuation of healthcare benefits for part-time Whole Foods workers.

971,"### Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the next influenza pandemic is a matter of when, not if, and has outlined a global plan to fight the viral disease and get ahead of a potential global outbreak. The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, emphasized the need for vigilance and preparedness, stating that the cost of a major influenza outbreak would far outweigh the price of prevention.

The last flu pandemic, caused by the H1N1 virus, occurred in 2009 and 2010. Studies of that pandemic revealed that at least one in five people worldwide were infected in the first year, with a death rate of 0.02 percent. Global health experts and the WHO are concerned that a more deadly flu virus could emerge in the future, jumping from animals to humans, mutating, and infecting hundreds of thousands of people.

Flu viruses are constantly changing and infect around a billion people every year in seasonal outbreaks. Out of these infections, 3 to 5 million are severe cases, resulting in between 290,000 and 650,000 seasonal flu-related respiratory deaths. Vaccines can help prevent some cases, and the WHO recommends annual vaccination, particularly for healthcare workers and vulnerable individuals such as the elderly, young children, and those with underlying illnesses.

The WHO's comprehensive plan includes measures to protect populations from annual outbreaks of seasonal flu and prepare for a pandemic. The two main goals of the plan are to improve worldwide capacities for surveillance and response by urging governments to develop a national flu plan, and to develop better tools to prevent, detect, control, and treat flu, including more effective vaccines and antiviral drugs.

In conclusion, the WHO is urging the world to prepare for the next flu pandemic, emphasizing the need for vigilance and preparedness. The organization's plan aims to improve surveillance and response capabilities globally and develop better tools to prevent and treat flu. Annual vaccination is recommended, especially for healthcare workers and vulnerable individuals.

972,"### Context: The article discusses the shortage of intravenous (IV) bags in both Puerto Rico and the mainland United States as a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The tweet from Ben Boyer criticizing the Trump administration's response to the disaster brought attention to this issue. The shortage of IV bags is due to the fact that many medical manufacturing plants, including Baxter International, the largest IV bag supplier in the US, are located in Puerto Rico and were affected by the hurricane.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been working closely with industry and officials to address the shortage of IV saline and other products. The FDA expects the shortage of IV fluids to improve in early 2018 based on information from the manufacturers. Baxter International confirmed that its facilities in Puerto Rico are connected to the local electrical grid and expects to return to normal supply levels for products made in Puerto Rico in the coming weeks. However, Baxter clarified that its Puerto Rican operations did not include the manufacture of saline IV solutions, and production of those products continues to run normally.

The FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, stated that addressing the IV saline shortage is a key area of focus and expects the situation to improve early this year. The article also mentions that the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Maria remains unclear, with conflicting reports and a recount of the death toll ordered by the Governor of Puerto Rico.

The shortage of IV bags has affected healthcare facilities in the United States, leading to challenges in administering necessary treatments. Boyer's tweet brought attention to this issue, and the story gained traction on social media, with many nurses and medical professionals sharing their experiences with the shortage.

In summary, the article highlights the shortage of IV bags in the United States due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The FDA and manufacturers are working to address the shortage, and improvements are expected in early 2018. The shortage has impacted healthcare facilities and patients, leading to challenges in providing necessary treatments.

973,"### Context: Two studies presented at the 2011 National HIV Prevention Conference in Atlanta highlighted the importance of targeted interventions to address HIV rates in specific populations. The first study, conducted by the Cleveland Department of Public Health, found that adding reminders to patients' electronic health records about the need for routine HIV testing led to significant improvements in testing rates. The study was conducted at MetroHealth, a Cleveland-based hospital system, and within six months of implementing the reminders, HIV testing in the hospital's outpatient clinics increased by nearly two-thirds. The effort was particularly effective at increasing testing among men.

The second study, conducted by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, used disease mapping technology to identify HIV-infected patients who were not receiving adequate treatment, thereby increasing the risk of transmission. The study found that treatment coverage varied significantly by neighborhood, with certain populations, such as blacks, people under 24, recent substance abusers, recent prisoners, and the poor, more likely to have poorly controlled disease. The findings from this study will be used to target resources to those who need it most.

Both studies are seen as important in the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy introduced by the White House, which aims to focus resources on populations most heavily affected by HIV, including gay and bisexual men of all races, blacks, and Hispanics. Currently, there are approximately 1.2 million people in the United States infected with HIV, and about one out of five infected individuals are unaware of their status. Rates of infection are particularly high among high-risk groups, such as men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and poor heterosexuals.

Overall, these studies highlight the importance of targeted interventions and the use of technology to improve HIV testing rates and treatment coverage in specific populations. By focusing resources on the areas and populations most affected by HIV, it is hoped that the National HIV/AIDS Strategy can effectively address the ongoing HIV epidemic in the United States.

",true,U.S. health experts are turning to sophisticated computer mapping technology and electronic medical records to identify pockets of Americans most at risk of HIV infection.,HIV in America: Studies zero in on trouble spots.,"The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to target resources to the areas and populations most affected by HIV, and two studies presented on Wednesday show how that can be done."
974,"### Context: The article discusses a press release about a new psoriasis drug called guselkumab. The release claims that guselkumab is more effective than the current treatment, adalimumab. However, the release fails to address the cost of the drug, which is an important aspect to consider. The comparison drug, adalimumab, costs almost $50,000 per year, so it is likely that guselkumab will also be expensive if it is approved. 

The release states that 81% of patients taking a 200-milligram dose of guselkumab reported minimal or no psoriasis symptoms after 40 weeks of treatment, compared to 49% of patients taking adalimumab. However, it does not mention that patients taking a 100-milligram dose of guselkumab fared slightly better at various points during the first 40 weeks of treatment. 

The release also fails to discuss the potential harms of guselkumab. The study noted that 20% of patients who received guselkumab experienced adverse events of infection during the first 16 weeks of the trial, compared to 14% among patients receiving a placebo and 12% of patients who received adalimumab. The release should have mentioned this higher rate of infection.

The release describes the overall study, but it does not mention important limitations. It does not note that the number of participants who received guselkumab was relatively small at each dosage level. The release also fails to mention that the study was based on a skewed patient population, with 91% white and 71% male participants.

The release also exaggerates the risks associated with psoriasis, stating that it increases a patient's risk for depression, heart disease, and diabetes. While psoriasis is correlated with an increased risk of these conditions, it is not known to be the cause of them.

The release does not mention that the study was funded by the company that manufactures guselkumab and that the company was actively involved in the study. This level of involvement should have been made clear.

The release only discusses guselkumab and adalimumab as potential treatments, but there are many other options available. The release should have explained why these drugs are important treatment options and when physicians may incorporate them into treatment plans.

The release mentions that the study was a phase II clinical trial and that a phase III trial is ongoing. It should have explained what a phase II trial means and what further work is needed to reach firm conclusions about the effectiveness and potential side effects of guselkumab.

Overall, the release lacks important information about the cost, potential harms, limitations, and involvement of the drug company. It also exaggerates the risks associated with psoriasis and fails to mention other treatment options.
Claim: New psoriasis drug is more effective than current treatment
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"The news release announces the results of a phase II clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which found that an experimental drug called guselkumab was more effective than a drug already on the market (called adalimumab) at controlling the symptoms of psoriasis. However, the release leaves some significant gaps, not giving readers any information about potential harms or costs associated with guselkumab. The release falls victim to the common practice of hyperbole in its headline. This was a phase II trial in a relatively small number of subjects. Suggesting that guselkumab is both more effective and less toxic than adalimumab is nothing more than speculation at this juncture. A more appropriate title would have been, “Early phase II trial suggests that new psoriasis drug may be more effective and has the potential to leave more of normal immune system intact.”  According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, more than 5 million people in the U.S. have psoriasis. The disease can have a significant impact on quality of life, and treatment can be extraordinarily expensive, so information about new, effective treatment options is certainly worth noting. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. While psoriasis itself is not life-threatening, because it is an autoimmune disease, some pharmaceutical treatment options affect the immune system and can increase a patient’s risk of infections — and those infections may pose a significant health risk of their own. This makes it particularly important for readers to be aware of potential health risks associated with new treatment options.",New psoriasis drug is more effective than current treatment,"This news release describes a phase 2 clinical trial of a new drug, guselkumab, for the treatment of psoriasis. The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it falls short in several important areas. It does not mention the cost of the drug, which is likely to be very high. It also does not mention the potential harms of the drug, which are significant. The release also exaggerates the risks associated with psoriasis, and it does not mention that the study was funded by the drug’s manufacturer and that the manufacturer was actively involved in the study. The release also does not mention that the study was based on a skewed patient population. The release also does not mention that the study was a phase II clinical trial and that a phase III trial is ongoing.

975,"### Context: The article discusses the issue of members of Congress receiving farm subsidies while also supporting cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. The author examines examples of lawmakers who receive farm subsidies and their stance on SNAP. 

One example is Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, who supports cuts to the food stamp program but is also one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies. Fincher and his wife collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012, with $70,000 in direct payments in 2012 alone. During the debate on cutting SNAP, Fincher argued that the government should not continuously print money and that it is other people's money being spent.

Another example is Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California, who owns one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which received $188,570 in direct farm payments in 2012. Since 1995, the partnership has received $5.13 million in subsidies. LaMalfa won an amendment that would require fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He believes the success of the food stamp program should be measured by self-sufficiency rather than the number of people on the rolls.

Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997. He recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, stating that the program has outgrown its original mission. 

The article also mentions that 15 members of Congress received farm subsidies in 2012, with 13 being Republicans and 2 being Democrats. The Democrats who received subsidies voted for a Senate version of the farm bill that would cut SNAP by $4 billion, while Brown, a Democrat, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored.

The author acknowledges that some of the subsidy recipients have expressed the need for reform in the farm subsidy system. Fincher, for example, voted to remove direct payments, and LaMalfa has long opposed the farm subsidy system. Stutzman has argued that the farm-support system is like a mandate and farmers have no choice but to take it.

In conclusion, the article examines the claim made by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown that some House members who receive farm subsidies also want to cut food stamps. The examples provided support Brown's claim, but it is noted that some subsidy recipients have expressed the need for reform in the farm subsidy system.

976,"### Context: Rep. Mike Thompson claimed that since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States. This claim was fact-checked and found to be accurate. The FBI conducts instant criminal background checks on people seeking to buy firearms at licensed gun stores, and from February 2004 through December 2014, 2,043 out of 2,233 weapons applications by people on the terrorist watch list were allowed to proceed. The majority of these applications were for firearms, but three were for explosives, all of which were approved. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published an analysis of FBI data that supported Thompson's claim. The GAO found that an average of about 200 successful weapons purchases were made each year by people on the terrorist watch list during the timeframe. However, it is important to note that the data only show weapons applications, not the number of individuals making those requests, so the actual number of individuals who legally purchased weapons could be higher. It is also worth considering that suspected terrorists could have legally bought weapons at gun shows, where transactions are not subject to federal background checks. The accuracy of the names on the terror watch list has been a point of concern. A 2009 audit by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General found that 35 percent of the identities on the watch list at the time were associated with FBI cases that did not contain current terrorism designations. However, it is presumed that a majority of the names on the list are truly ""suspected terrorists."" Overall, Thompson's claim is accurate, but it is important to consider the limitations and potential inaccuracies of the watch list.
Claim: Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Rep. Mike Thompson said recently on the House floor that: ""Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the U.S."" He backed up his claim with FBI data that show 2,043 people on the agency’s terror watch list successfully applied for weapons at licensed gun shops over the past decade. There’s no way to track how many people on the list legally bought weapons at gun shows, as those transactions aren’t subject to federal background checks. But it makes sense to assume some did. The congressman left out the fact that a federal audit in 2009 found 35 percent of the identities on the list had no ties to current terrorism cases. The audit said many of the names remained on the list when they should have been removed. But given the large size of the terror watch list — with perhaps 10,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners — it’s reasonable to assume that 200 or more on the list made legal weapons purchases each year over the past decade.","Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States.","Thompson said, """"Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States."""" Thompson’s claim is backed up by a 2014 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which found that an average of about 200 successful weapons purchases were made each year by people on the terrorist watch list during the timeframe. The GAO report also found that three people on the list were allowed to purchase explosives. The GAO report is based on FBI data, which is presumed to be accurate. However, the data only show weapons applications, not the number of individuals making those requests, so the actual number of individuals who legally purchased weapons could be higher. Also, suspected terrorists could have legally bought weapons at gun shows, where transactions are not subject to federal background checks. Finally, the accuracy of the names on the watch list has been a point of concern. A 2009 audit by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General found that 35 percent of the identities on the watch list at the time were associated with FBI cases that did not contain current terrorism designations. It is presumed that a majority of the names on the list are truly """"suspected terrorists."""" All things considered, Thompson’s claim is accurate."
977,"### Context: The claim that Girl Scout cookies fund Planned Parenthood is false. The national organization, Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA), does not have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. However, some regional Girl Scout councils have partnered with Planned Parenthood in the past to provide sex education programs. The first call for a Girl Scout cookie boycott came in 2004 from Pro-Life Waco, a pro-life organization in Texas. They were upset when a local council offered a sex education program in partnership with a Planned Parenthood office in Waco.

The CEO of GSUSA at the time, Kathy Clonginger, defended the council's decision on the ""Today"" show, stating that local councils make decisions based on their community context and the needs of girls and their families. Clonginger did not acknowledge a national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood, and there is no evidence of such a partnership. GSUSA states that decisions regarding human sexuality, birth control, and abortion are made at the local level by parents, volunteers, and council members.

In 2014, GSUSA CEO Anna Maria Chavez denied a national relationship between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood in a YouTube video, stating that reproductive issues are private matters best left to families. This statement caused some confusion, as it contradicted Clonginger's earlier remarks. The explanation is that Clonginger acknowledged local ""relationships"" between councils and Planned Parenthood, while Chavez denied a national partnership.

There has also been confusion about where the money from Girl Scout cookie sales goes. The sale proceeds from local troops stay within local councils, and GSUSA does not receive a cut of the revenue. However, GSUSA does receive licensing royalties from the bakers of the cookies. Troops must pool their proceeds to pay for program supplies, activities, and group travel. Individual Girl Scouts can earn recognition items, program credits, and travel experiences based on their sales, but all proceeds and rewards must be used to enhance each girl's Girl Scout experience.

In conclusion, the claim that Girl Scout cookies fund Planned Parenthood is false. While some regional Girl Scout councils have partnered with Planned Parenthood in the past for sex education programs, there is no national partnership between GSUSA and Planned Parenthood. The money from cookie sales stays within local councils, and GSUSA does not receive a portion of the revenue.

978,"### Context: The conflict between Taliban insurgents and Pakistan's army has resulted in thousands of deaths and countless injuries. However, the psychological toll of the violence often goes unnoticed. Underfunded and understaffed hospitals are treating a rising number of people suffering from depression, anxiety attacks, paranoia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Even smaller attacks reported in the news can trigger people to seek psychiatric care. The stigma attached to mental illness has eased in Pakistan, making it easier for people to seek help. However, those living in the conflict-ridden areas of the northwest have limited access to psychological care facilities and must travel to cities like Peshawar for treatment. The Sarhad Psychiatric Hospital in Peshawar is the only proper mental health facility in the region, but it is underfunded and lacks resources. The hospital's senior consultant, Muhammad Tariq, treats up to 100 patients a day and is also the region's main forensic psychologist. The hospital lacks funding for basic resources like computers, and Tariq feels limited in what he can do. The hospital sees 10-15 new patients every day who are mentally affected by the violence. Many of these patients have lost their homes and livelihoods. The most challenging cases are those who already have mental illnesses and are further traumatized by the violence. Family support is crucial for these patients, but due to the fighting, it is too dangerous for them to return home. The article highlights the story of Muhammad Ikhtiar, whose schizophrenic son was affected by the violence and now requires constant care. Ikhtiar also faces challenges in making a living while caring for his son. Another patient, Muhammad Iqbal, suffers from bipolar disorder and is unaware of the dangers in his home village infested with militants. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for increased resources and support for mental health care in conflict-affected areas of Pakistan.

980,"### Context: The article discusses President Barack Obama's claim that health care reform will not cut Medicare benefits. It mentions that there are three versions of health care reform in the House, and each dedicates hundreds of pages to Medicare. The article explains that there are two basic ways most people get Medicare coverage: traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs. The House bill proposes to cut growth in Medicare spending, but not benefits. The biggest savings in the bill would come from a reduction in annual payment adjustments for some Medicare services. Obama also wants to save money on the Medicare Advantage program, which costs taxpayers more than the traditional Medicare plan. The House bills propose changes to the program that would result in savings. Experts from both sides of the debate agree that the changes could be considered cuts, but they also expand coverage for seniors and make some components of Medicare less expensive for patients. The article mentions that the core benefits of Medicare will not change, but the extra benefits provided by Medicare Advantage could be changed. It also discusses a $20 billion cut in hospital readmission subsidies and how cuts to Medicare payments could ultimately affect patients. The article concludes that while the bill does not directly trim Medicare benefits, the financial changes proposed could lead to reduced benefits, particularly for people in the Advantage program. Therefore, it is a stretch for Obama to claim that Medicare patients won't see changes in their plans as a result of the health care reform proposal.

981,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Leticia Van de Putte in a video ad, where she presents Republican nominee Dan Patrick as too extreme on public safety issues. The claim is that Patrick voted against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free. Van de Putte cites Patrick's vote against the 2014-15 state budget as the basis for her claim.

The article provides evidence that contradicts Van de Putte's claim. It states that Patrick was among senators who initially put the funding for testing rape kits into the state budget. Although he voted against the final overall budget, there is no indication that he did so to stop the kits from being tested. The funding for testing the kits passed into law.

The article also mentions that the tests of the rape kits started in fall 2014, after the budget took effect in September 2013. The kits were bid out to private laboratories, and the resulting DNA hits are expected to lead to convictions and take sexual offenders off the streets. However, it is still too early in the process to determine the impact of the testing on prosecutions.

The article concludes that Van de Putte's claim is flawed and incorrect. Patrick's vote against the final budget did not prevent the funding for testing rape kits from being included, and there is no evidence to support the claim that rapists walked free as a result of his actions. The claim is deemed to be ""PANTS ON FIRE"" - not accurate and making a ridiculous claim.
Claim: In 2013,"" Dan Patrick voted ""against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free.

### Explanation:
",false,"Van de Putte said Patrick voted ""against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free."" This claim is flawed in various ways -- starting with blaming Patrick for a result that didn’t come to be. In reality, Patrick appears to have been among senators to initially put the kit-test funding into the state budget. And while he voted against the final overall budget, there’s no indication he did so to stop the kits from being tested. Also, the contention that rapists walked free as a result of Patrick’s action is incorrect. The funding (to repeat) passed into law. When a statement is incorrect and ridiculous, the Truth-O-Meter warms up in a hurry. The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.","In 2013,"" Dan Patrick voted ""against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free.","Leticia Van de Putte said in a video ad that Dan Patrick voted """"against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free.""""

982,"### Context: The claim that Jordan's King Abdullah II murdered his wife, Queen Rania, is false. The article states that on June 24, 2016, a story emerged claiming that Queen Rania was killed by her husband in Rome due to an alleged affair with Bono, the frontman of U2. However, the article clarifies that this story is not true and originated from a website called AWD News, which is known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information.

The article highlights that AWD News often creates alarming and clickable stories by playing on nationalistic fantasies and conspiracy theories. It also mentions that the website has published other dubious headlines, such as the creation of a hidden EU army, Saudi Arabia offering to buy Facebook and arrest pro-democracy activists, and tying the assassins of British MP Jo Cox and threats against Donald Trump to the UK military and CIA.

The article further discredits the claim by stating that if Queen Rania had been murdered by King Abdullah II, it would not have been leaked by a conspiracy-oriented website. Additionally, Queen Rania herself has been active on social media, posting as recently as the time of the article's publication, which contradicts the claim of her murder.

In conclusion, the claim that King Abdullah II murdered Queen Rania is false and originated from a website known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information.

983,"### Context: The article discusses the rise in popularity of Paiche, a large freshwater fish from the Amazon, in restaurants and grocery stores around the world. The fish, which can weigh up to 220 pounds, was traditionally caught by spear-fishing indigenous peoples but its numbers declined due to unsustainable fishing practices and urban development in the Amazon. Amazone, a company backed by the Hochschild Group, aims to save the species from extinction by breeding organic, farm-raised fish for export and releasing some back into the wild.

Chefs and consumers are drawn to Paiche because it is a low-fat, mercury-free white fish with a texture similar to sea bass. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has listed Chilean sea bass as a fish to avoid due to unsustainable fishing practices and high mercury levels, making Paiche an attractive alternative. Restaurants in cities like New York, Miami, Houston, and Boston now serve Amazone's Paiche, and it is also sold in Spain, France, and Italy.

Amazone, although not yet profitable, expects to export $3 million worth of frozen Paiche this year, up from $500,000 in 2011. The company aims to supply global gourmet markets without exploiting the fish for profit. Amazone sells Paiche in the United States through ArtisanFish, a Florida-based wholesaler that focuses on protecting the environment and marketing hormone-free, premium seafood. ArtisanFish has negotiated an agreement to sell Paiche in a U.S. retail chain, but the retailer's name is not disclosed.

The article also mentions the growing popularity of Paiche in Lima, Peru's emerging culinary capital. Celebrity chef Pedro Miguel Schiaffino grills Paiche steaks and uses the fish to make ceviche, a Peruvian staple, at his upscale Malabar restaurant.

Overall, the article highlights the efforts of Amazone and ArtisanFish to promote sustainable fishing practices and offer a viable alternative to Chilean sea bass. Paiche's popularity is growing among conscientious gourmets and it is becoming more widely available in restaurants and grocery stores around the world.

984,"### Context: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital has implemented a new program to ease the strain on emergency rooms and intensive care units in New York state, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. The program involves sending more than 200 people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 home with a pulse oximeter to track their oxygen levels. A doctor or nurse practitioner follows up with them via video conference. The pulse oximeter is a small electronic device that clips onto a fingertip to indirectly measure the oxygen saturation of a patient's blood. Severe cases of COVID-19 can block the lungs, hindering their ability to pass oxygen into the bloodstream.

The patients in the program are also provided with a portable oxygen concentrating machine that sends oxygen-rich air through a nasal cannula. The patients are asked to log their oximeter readings and share them with a healthcare professional during 12-hour and 24-hour consultations. If a patient's condition worsens, they may be readmitted to the hospital. As of Wednesday, no patient in the program has died at home, but about 15 percent were asked to return to the hospital for inpatient care.

Similar programs using oximeters have been implemented by at least two other hospital systems outside of New York. Doctors believe that this approach could have benefits for patients with COVID-19, as there can be a lag in symptoms before a patient is aware of breathing problems. By giving patients a pulse oximeter to use at home, doctors can err on the side of safety and monitor their oxygen levels remotely.

Overall, this program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital demonstrates how doctors are adapting and loosening normal protocols to ease the strain on emergency rooms and intensive care units in New York state. By sending patients home with pulse oximeters and providing remote follow-up care, doctors can monitor their oxygen levels and potentially identify worsening conditions before they become critical. This approach could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19, as there is still much to learn about the disease and its symptoms.

985,"### Context: Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush claimed that Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues."" This claim was made during a town hall event in Englewood, Colorado, where an audience member asked Bush about his record on women’s health and what he would do for women’s health, particularly for veterans, if elected president. Bush responded by stating that he does not believe Planned Parenthood should receive any funding because they are not involved in women’s health issues.

Planned Parenthood is a controversial organization that provides a range of reproductive health services, including contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services, and cancer screenings such as breast exams. While they do provide abortion services, which Bush opposes, the majority of their services are related to women’s health.

According to the National Library of Medicine, women’s health encompasses the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being. Planned Parenthood's primary focus is reproductive health, which is a significant aspect of women’s health. In 2013, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients and provided nearly 11 million services. Only 12 percent of patients received an abortion, meaning the remaining 88 percent received other health services.

Fact-checkers at the Washington Post's Fact Checker gave Bush's claim four Pinocchios, their lowest rating. They pointed out that Planned Parenthood offers a wide range of services that are directly related to women’s health, such as contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests, and STI testing and treatment. While Bush opposes abortion, it is inaccurate to claim that Planned Parenthood is not addressing women’s health issues.

In response to criticism from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Bush tweeted that Planned Parenthood's treatment of the unborn has been horrifying and suggested supporting quality women's health programs instead. However, this does not negate the fact that Planned Parenthood provides essential services for women's health.

In conclusion, Jeb Bush's claim that Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues"" is contradicted by the organization's provision of over 10 million services in 2013, including various aspects of women's health. While Bush opposes abortion, it is misleading to suggest that Planned Parenthood does not address women's health issues.

Bush is opposed to abortion, but it doesn’t make sense to say that Planned Parenthood isn’t addressing women’s health issues.","Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues.","Bush said Planned Parenthood is """"not actually doing women’s health issues."""" That’s a ridiculous claim, given that Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million patients in 2013 and provided more than 10 million services. It’s true that abortion is a part of that, but so are a host of other services that fall under the umbrella of women’s health."

989,"### Context: Negotiations between Democratic and Republican leaders in the United States government stalled due to a dispute over the cost of a prospective vaccine for the coronavirus strain known as COVID-19. Democrats are pushing for significant funding to purchase large amounts of coronavirus diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines, which would be made available to the public free of cost. They want to maintain the ""fair and reasonable price"" federal procurement standard to prevent price gouging. On the other hand, Republicans argue that they are not asking for changes to the underlying procurement standards and are trying to fight Democratic efforts to create new price controls.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar stated that while they want to make the vaccine affordable, they cannot control the price because they need private sector investment. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called for the vaccine to be covered under Medicare plans to ensure that seniors do not have to worry about the cost.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), health insurers must cover federally-recommended vaccines at no cost for most people. This coverage extends to health insurance obtained through employers and programs like Medicaid for children and low-income individuals. The ACA exempts vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control from co-pays and deductibles.

990,"### Context: The claim that Vicks VapoRub caused a child's death is untrue. While the product has been associated with breathing problems in infants and toddlers, there is no evidence to suggest that it has been fatal. The story of a child dying after Vicks VapoRub was applied to their chest and under their nose is a fake news story that circulated on the internet. Facebook users flagged the post as part of the platform's crackdown on fake news.

Bruce Rubin, a pediatrician, has followed questions about Vicks VapoRub for a decade. He published a peer-reviewed article in 2009 based on a case where parents applied Vicks under their child's nose and the child stopped breathing. However, in the 10 years since that case, Rubin has not seen any reports of deaths related to Vicks VapoRub. There have been about 30 reports of breathing distress in very small children due to Vicks being applied under the nose, but no deaths.

A 2012 study found that inhaling menthol, one of Vicks' active ingredients, leads to increased mucus production, but the study did not cite any examples of a child dying from it. Jennifer Lowry, a toxicologist, has never heard of a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub. She has concerns about the product containing camphor, but her main worry is that parents will have children eat it, which is dangerous.

Procter and Gamble, the maker of Vicks VapoRub, has never had a family report a fatality due to inhaling the product. Despite efforts to investigate the social media post about the alleged death, there is no verifiable information regarding the city and name of the person involved. Snopes, a myth-busting website, also found that the claim lacked substance.

A Canadian study looked at cases of children eating Vicks or similar products, which sent children to the emergency room but were not fatal. The only exception was a case in 1983 where a child with pneumonia consumed a home remedy containing camphor and alcohol.

In conclusion, the claim that Vicks VapoRub caused a child's death is false. While the product has been linked to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, there is no evidence of any deaths.

The plant belongs to the Nepenthes genus and is similar to the Venus flytrap. Clinton Morse, a plant collections manager, confirmed that the image is authentic and that all Nepenthes plants have a similar passive pitfall trap. As the trap matures, the lid opens up, giving the plant a less penile appearance. The open trap is designed to attract insects, which then fall into the water-filled trap. The plant scavenges the nutrients from the decaying bodies of the trapped insects. The plant's carnivorous behavior is described in a 1999 review, which explains that the lip of the pitcher, called the peristome, has nectaries that attract insects. The steep walls of the pitcher, along with a lining of epicuticular wax, cause the insects to slip and fall into the fluid at the base of the pitcher, where they become trapped.

The bill includes provisions such as almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, and assistance for the unemployed, renters, homeowners, college debt holders, and the struggling Postal Service.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized the urgency of passing the bill, stating that not acting now would be irresponsible and would cost more in terms of lives, livelihoods, and the budget. Republicans criticized the bill as a bloated Democratic wish-list and argued that they want to assess the effectiveness of the $3 trillion already approved before considering additional measures. President Donald Trump expressed support for a ""Phase Four"" relief bill but called for protections for reopening businesses from liability lawsuits and a cut to payroll taxes.

During the debate, the House floor was sparsely populated, and lawmakers and aides wore protective masks and gloves. Roll call votes were conducted in small groups to limit crowding. Democrats named the bill ""The Heroes Act"" to highlight its support for front-line emergency workers. Democrats saw Republican opposition as an easy campaign target, while Republicans viewed the bill as a Democratic political blunder. They criticized the bill for its generous unemployment benefits, provisions assisting immigrants in the U.S. illegally, and measures related to voting by mail and the marijuana industry's access to banks.

The bill faced divisions within the Democratic Party, with some moderate Democrats opposing it due to its price tag and politically contentious provisions. A few progressive Democrats were also dissatisfied, as they wanted more guarantees for workers' salaries and health insurance coverage. Fourteen Democrats voted against the bill, most of whom are centrists and vulnerable in the upcoming elections.

The passage of this bill highlights the crumbling bipartisan consensus that produced previous coronavirus relief bills. Polls show that GOP voters are satisfied with the federal response and are not demanding further action. The bill's price tag, estimated to exceed $3.5 trillion, and a lack of consultation with Republicans by Pelosi contributed to GOP opposition. The lone Republican supporting the bill was Rep. Peter King of New York, who is retiring.

993,"### Context: A second man has been arrested in connection with the overdose death of rapper Mac Miller. Ryan Reavis, 36, was charged with possessing marijuana and prescription drugs, as well as weapons offenses and fraud. However, he has not been directly accused of causing Miller's death. Reavis' arrest comes after Cameron James Pettit, 28, was charged with selling drugs to Miller shortly before his death. Police have not provided details on the connection between Reavis and Miller. Authorities served a search warrant at Reavis' home in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, where they seized prescription pills, marijuana, a doctor's prescription pad, firearms, ammunition, and a homemade firearm suppressor. Reavis is being held on $50,000 bail. It is unclear if he has an attorney. Pettit, who was charged in federal court, has not entered a plea yet. Miller, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, died a year ago in his Los Angeles home from an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol, and fentanyl. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid that has contributed to a deadly epidemic in the US and has claimed the lives of other musicians like Prince. Miller's music often discussed his depression and drug use, earning him fans among some of the biggest names in hip-hop. He was also in a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande. After his death, Grande posted an affectionate video of him on her Instagram page and released a song, ""Thank U Next,"" that mentioned him lovingly. Miller's death is part of a national wave of opioid abuse that has claimed the lives of other musicians, including Prince and Matthew Roberts, guitarist for the band 3 Doors Down.

The department says it’s prohibited by privacy laws from identifying the two children who died and would not give their exact ages or where they lived in Douglas County. The pediatric deaths follow the department’s report earlier this week that two adult flu-related adult deaths in people over 65 years have been reported in Douglas County. Health officials say the very young, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are at greater risk of complications from the respiratory illness. The most recent report from the department on Monday says Douglas County has had 3,758 lab-confirmed flu cases this flu season. The flu season runs through April, so the department urged those who’ve not gotten a flu vaccine to get one.

995,"### Context: A panel from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati has ruled that an Ohio law banning abortions in cases where there is a positive test result or prenatal diagnosis indicating Down syndrome is likely unconstitutional. The law, signed in 2017 by former Republican Gov. John Kasich, would have made it a fourth-degree felony for physicians to perform an abortion under such circumstances. The pregnant woman would not have faced criminal liability. The ruling is a disappointment for abortion opponents who had promoted the law as an anti-discrimination measure. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office plans to seek reconsideration by the full 6th Circuit.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Ohio Department of Health, the state medical board, and county prosecutors over the law on behalf of Planned Parenthood and several abortion providers. A federal judge had previously placed the state law on temporary hold, stating that federal law is clear that states cannot limit a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy before viability. The state appealed, leading to the recent ruling.

Ohio Right to Life, the state’s oldest and largest anti-abortion group, expressed sadness over the ruling. They had promoted the law as a protection against ""lethal discrimination"" against children with Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a genetic abnormality that causes developmental delays and medical conditions. The National Down Syndrome Society estimates that about one in every 700 babies in the United States is born with the condition.

Abortion rights groups argue that the Down syndrome bans are part of a larger effort to restrict a woman’s right to an abortion. They label such restrictions as ""reason bans"" because they attempt to influence a woman's decision-making process regarding her pregnancy.

Overall, the ruling from the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals leaves the Ohio law banning Down syndrome abortions on hold, as it is likely unconstitutional. The decision is disappointing for abortion opponents who viewed the law as an anti-discrimination measure, while abortion rights groups argue that it is an attempt to limit a woman's right to choose. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office plans to seek reconsideration by the full 6th Circuit.

997,"### Context: The article discusses an ad run by the Patriot Majority PAC that criticizes Sharron Angle's support for the Chilean ""privatization scheme"" and claims that it has resulted in hidden fees, fewer benefits, and millions of people with no coverage. The article examines the validity of these claims.

Regarding hidden fees, the article acknowledges that high fees have been a concern in the Chilean system. However, experts state that fees are more obvious in Chile than in other countries because they are levied on top of the mandatory contribution to private pensions. While the ad is correct in criticizing fees, it is incorrect to say they are hidden.

In terms of fewer benefits, studies have shown a long-term rate of return in the Chilean system of roughly 10 percent, which is high by international standards. Experts agree that the current system is preferable to the pre-1981 system, which was unsustainable and in crisis. Therefore, suggesting that switching to a private system resulted in fewer benefits is misleading.

The claim that millions of people have no coverage is true but misleading. The percentage of Chileans participating in the system has hovered around two-thirds, similar to the pre-1981 system. The coverage gaps are attributed to the nature of the Chilean economy, with low-income workers in the underground economy and self-employed individuals having lower participation rates. The 2008 reform addressed coverage concerns by introducing a universal pension and topping up small pensions.

Overall, the article concludes that the ad exaggerates the issues with the Chilean system. While fees are a problem, they are not hidden. The system has provided strong returns and is sounder than the pre-1981 system. The coverage gaps are not unique to the privatized system and are influenced by specific factors in Chile's economy. The ad's rhetoric, imagery, and exaggerations undermine its reasonable point that the Chilean system may be seen as inferior to Social Security by most Americans.

998,"### Context: A study conducted by scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts has found that flounder in Boston Harbor are now tumor-free. This is a significant turnaround from the late 1980s when over three-quarters of the species in the harbor were found to have signs of liver disease, including cancerous tumors. The health of the flounder in the harbor became emblematic of the broader environmental challenges faced by the area and led to a series of lawsuits. In 1985, a federal court decision compelled Massachusetts to properly treat sewage dumped into the harbor, resulting in the completion of a new sewage treatment plant and the opening of an underground tunnel to direct discharge away from the harbor. Since then, the results have been dramatic, with marine animals such as porpoises, seals, and humpback whales now regularly seen in the harbor. The improved water quality in the rivers that feed into the harbor and the cleanliness of its beaches have also been noted. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, the agency responsible for drinking water and sewage, has called the clean-up of Boston Harbor the greatest environmental achievement of this generation.

999,"### Context: The claim that the European Union ordered reporters not to report whether a terrorist is Muslim is not entirely accurate. The claim is based on a report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), which was commissioned by the Council of Europe to monitor human rights abuses. The report recommended that the media take responsibility for responsible reporting to avoid perpetuating prejudice and biased information, as well as to avoid harm to targeted persons or vulnerable groups. The report also mentioned a study by Teesside University, which found that instances of anti-Muslim violence increased in the seven-day period immediately after terror attacks when the media stressed the Muslim background of the perpetrators.

However, it is important to note that the ECRI report did not issue a mandate but rather a recommendation. The report called for an independent press regulator but also emphasized the need to protect editorial independence and avoid government officials encroaching on media outlets. The report also highlighted previous criticisms of media practices in the UK, such as the Leveson Inquiry, which revealed unethical practices by News International.

The article points out that the headlines and allegations made by the Gatestone Institute and the Daily Mail, which suggest that the European Union ordered reporters not to report whether a terrorist is Muslim, are misleading. The European Council and the European Union are separate organizations, and the ECRI report does not blame the media for hate crimes but rather emphasizes the importance of responsible reporting.

In summary, while the ECRI report does recommend responsible reporting by the media to avoid perpetuating prejudice and biased information, it does not order reporters not to report whether a terrorist is Muslim. The report also calls for an independent press regulator but emphasizes the need to protect editorial independence. The headlines and allegations made by certain media outlets are misleading and do not accurately represent the content of the report.

1000,"### Context: The article discusses three claims made against Donald Trump. The first claim is that in 1989, Trump's first ex-wife, Ivana, swore under oath in a deposition that he had violently raped her. This claim originated from a book by Harry Hurt III, which detailed Ivana's divorce deposition. Trump denied the rape allegation and the suggestion that he had a scalp-reduction procedure. Ivana later issued a statement saying that the rape allegation was ""without merit,"" but did not deny making the statement under oath.

The second claim is that Trump Model Management, his modeling agency, was caught trafficking young girls and hiding them in basements. However, this claim is a gross exaggeration. A Mother Jones article from August 2016 accused Trump Model Management of illegal employment practices, such as not obtaining work visas for foreign models and encouraging them to deceive customs officials. The article mentioned cramped living arrangements, but did not suggest that young girls were being trafficked or hidden in basements.

The third claim is a civil lawsuit filed against Trump by a woman using the alias ""Katie Johnson."" She claimed that Trump sexually and physically abused her at parties hosted by Jeffrey Epstein when she was 13 years old. However, ""Katie Johnson"" has not been identified or interviewed, and no evidence has been provided outside of her court filing. Trump has not had the opportunity to confront his accuser or the evidence against him in court.

In summary, the article addresses the three claims made against Donald Trump. The first claim is based on Ivana Trump's divorce deposition, but she later issued a statement saying the allegation was without merit. The second claim is an exaggeration of an article that accused Trump Model Management of illegal employment practices, not human trafficking. The third claim is a civil lawsuit filed by an anonymous woman, but no evidence has been provided.

1001,"### Context: According to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine, alternative therapies such as acupuncture and hypnosis can be effective options for smokers who want to quit. The researchers, led by Mehdi Tahiri of McGill University, stated that while there are still questions about the effectiveness of these therapies compared to conventional methods, they should be recommended as choices for smokers who are not interested in medication or have not had success with standard therapies.

The study found that smokers who underwent acupuncture were more than three times as likely to be tobacco-free six months to a year later. Similarly, smokers who received hypnosis had a higher success rate compared to those who had minimal help. However, the success rate was not consistent across all tests conducted, although the overall trends pointed to the benefits of alternative treatment.

One study in 2008 showed that 55 percent of smokers who received laser acupuncture quit smoking in six months, compared to only four percent of those who did not receive the treatment. However, a 2007 study from Taiwan reported a lower success rate for needle acupuncture around the ear, with only nine percent of participants quitting after six months compared to six percent without the treatment. The situation was similar for hypnosis, with two studies showing a significant impact and 20 to 45 percent of patients being smoke-free six months to a year later, while the other two trials showed smaller effects.

The researchers noted that there are still questions about the number of sessions of acupuncture or hypnosis that might be necessary, as well as which specific techniques are best. Other research reviews have also concluded that the effectiveness of alternative therapies for quitting smoking is still uncertain.

In conclusion, the study suggests that acupuncture and hypnosis can be viable options for smokers who want to quit, especially for those who are not interested in medication or have not had success with standard therapies. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal number of sessions and techniques for these alternative treatments.

1002,"### Context: Scientists in Hong Kong and the United States have made a breakthrough in prenatal diagnosis by analyzing a sample of the mother's blood to identify all the DNA strands that belong to the fetus. Previously, it was believed that only part of the baby's DNA was present in the mother's blood, but the research team discovered that the mother's plasma holds the entire fetal genome. This discovery allows for the construction of a screen for a number of diseases that are genetically inherited.

The study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, focused on a couple undergoing prenatal diagnosis for a hereditary blood disorder called beta-thalassemia. By analyzing the mother's blood, the team found that 90 percent of the DNA belonged to the mother and 10 percent belonged to the baby. They were able to determine that the fetus inherited a beta-thalassemia mutant gene from the father, making the baby a carrier of the disease.

Lead author Dennis Lo described the process of analyzing the fetal genome as assembling a jigsaw puzzle with millions of pieces. The challenge is that the mother's own DNA is mixed in with the fetal DNA, making it more difficult to piece together. However, with this new technology, it is now possible to look for any disease that is genetically inherited.

While this breakthrough is significant, experts caution that it is still too early to widely apply this technology. There is a need for accurate interpretation of the results, as many conditions may only manifest in adult life. Additionally, individuals may not want to know certain information about their health when they are older.

Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of analyzing a mother's blood to detect diseases in the fetus. It opens up possibilities for prenatal diagnosis and screening for a range of genetic conditions. However, further research and careful interpretation of results are necessary before this technology can be widely implemented.

1003,"### Context: One year after the deadly shootings at an anti-Vedanta protest in India, no police officer has been arrested or charged in connection with the incident. A judicial commission set up to investigate the shootings has provided no updates on its progress. The incident was one of the deadliest environmental protests in India in a decade. The United Nations' human rights experts condemned the ""apparent excessive and disproportionate use of lethal force by police"" in May 2018. India's National Human Rights Commission dropped its inquiry, citing ""adequate compensation"" paid to victims and attempts by the state to restore law and order. However, people surrounding the Vedanta Ltd smelter, which was shuttered by state authorities for allegedly poisoning groundwater, say they are still being intimidated by local police. The company denies the pollution allegations. Some residents allege they have been detained and beaten by the police and have been refused the right to protest. One activist, S Mugilan, has been missing since February 15, the day he held a news conference. Local police say their actions since the shootings have been aimed at keeping the lid on any potential trouble, even if that means curbing some rights to freedom of speech or protest. The police shot at the protesters without warning on May 22, 2018, killing 12 people with shots to the head and chest, half of them from behind. Another protester died after being allegedly beaten by the police. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was asked by the Madras High Court to file charges within four months, but nine months later, no action has been taken. Vedanta executives have been campaigning to reopen the smelter, which the company says did not pollute its surroundings. Local residents say the police are clamping down on any attempts to discuss the shootings or the plant shutdown. In the days and weeks following the protest, local police detained 277 people, mostly aged between 18 to 30, though they were all subsequently released following a court order. The families of the 13 people killed received compensation, but none have hired a lawyer to seek more. Many of those affected by the incident have faced financial losses and disrupted education. People seeking justice are still being picked up by the police.

Dr. Kien Vuu, a professor of medicine, stated that it is unlikely for JUULing to have a short-term carcinogenic effect that would cause cancer in young people. Research on the long-term effects of e-cigarette use is ongoing, but studies have shown that e-cigarettes can be an effective smoking cessation aid. JUUL has implemented a minimum age restriction of 21 for purchasing their products, regardless of state laws. The company has addressed the rumor and stated that it is unsubstantiated and reckless. JUUL Labs is committed to improving public health and eliminating cigarettes by providing a true alternative for adult smokers. They have implemented technological advances and best practices to minimize emissions and do not add chemicals of concern to their products.

1005,"### Context: According to an article, Governor Rick Perry claims that Texas is a model state that escaped the recession with few battle scars and a lot of jobs, which is why people are moving there. He states that 1,000 people are moving to Texas every day. The article investigates this claim and provides some statistics to support it.

The article mentions that the governor's staff estimated the daily population growth by dividing the state's annual population growth by 365 days. The statistics used for this estimation came from the U.S. Census Bureau. Between July 1, 2008, and July 1, 2009, Texas gained 478,012 more people, making it the state with the highest population growth during that period. California was second with 381,000 new people. However, the net population change includes births and people leaving the state, so it doesn't solely represent newcomers.

To determine the number of newcomers, the article refers to the U.S. Census Bureau and states that about 635 people come to Texas every day, on average. This number is based on the average daily net migration from other states (393) and other countries (242). Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tracks the addresses of people who file taxes each year and reports that information to the Census Bureau. According to the IRS data from 2007 to 2008, 493,840 people switched their residence to Texas, which is approximately 1,353 people each day.

The article concludes that Governor Perry's claim is close to being accurate, although he didn't consider in-state births or people moving away. The number of people moving to Texas varies, but based on the IRS data from 2007 to 2008, more than 1,300 people on average were relocating to Texas during that time frame. Therefore, the claim is ruled as true, even if the governor used slightly outdated data as evidence.

1006,"### Context: The article titled ""Broccoli May Slow or Reverse Some Atherosclerosis"" discusses a study that suggests sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, may have the potential to reduce the development of atherosclerosis. The study was conducted on 15 rabbits and found that those given a sulforaphane supplement experienced a decrease in lipid levels compared to the control group.

The article highlights the benefits of sulforaphane in reducing lipid levels in the rabbits, but it does not provide information on the availability or cost of the supplement. It also fails to discuss the potential implications of these results for cardiovascular risk in humans.

The article mentions that sulforaphane can have medication-like effects and may be harmful for individuals taking the blood thinner Coumadin. However, it does not provide any further information on potential risks or precautions.

The article does not effectively bridge the gap between the study conducted on rabbits and its potential application to humans. It also fails to provide important context and caveats about early-stage animal research. The lack of quotes from researchers or outside sources further limits the article's credibility.

There is no discussion of alternate strategies for reducing arterial plaques or heart disease, and the article does not provide information on the availability or type of intervention that might be beneficial for individuals.

The article raises concerns about the potential for companies to market sulforaphane supplements based on this single study, without sufficient evidence or context. It questions why a media outlet would publicize research at such an early stage.

The article claims that this study is the first to examine the link between sulforaphane and atherosclerosis, but there is no evidence of original reporting or reliance on a news release.

Overall, the article lacks important information, context, and caveats. It fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the study's findings and their potential implications for humans.

1007,"### Context: An expert panel has reaffirmed the need for colon cancer screening to begin at age 50. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a recommendation stating that adults between the ages of 50 and 75 should be screened for colon cancer. The recommendation received an ""A"" grade, indicating the highest level of confidence. However, for individuals over the age of 75, the recommendation received a ""C"" grade, indicating moderate certainty and based on individual considerations.

The article highlights that the costs of screening can vary significantly depending on the test and the terms of a person's health insurance coverage. While insurance may cover the cost of screening, follow-up tests to check suspicious results may result in high medical bills. The article argues that the story should have mentioned the costs of screening, as well as the potential harms, such as anxiety, bleeding, colon perforation, and sedation-related events.

The effectiveness of different screening tests and the quantified benefits of each method are not addressed in the article. The story should have provided more information on the differences in effectiveness and the quality of evidence for each screening test.

The article also notes that colonoscopy, which was lauded in the story, accounts for most of the serious harms caused by colon cancer screening. This information should have been included to provide a balanced view of the benefits and risks of different screening methods.

The USPSTF recommendation is the result of a structured review of available studies on colon cancer screening, as well as new analyses of the data. The article suggests that the story could have done more to explain what sets this recommendation apart from other reports and why it should be trusted.

The article mentions that an average-risk person who is informed about the screening may choose not to be screened as a reasonable choice, but only as part of a shared decision-making process with their doctor. This information should have been included in the story to provide a comprehensive view of the options available to individuals.

Overall, the article argues that the story should have provided more information on the costs, benefits, and potential harms of colon cancer screening. It also suggests that original commentary directly from task force members would have provided unique insights not found in the news release.
Claim: Expert Panel Reaffirms Need for Colon Cancer Screen Beginning at Age 50
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story about updated colon cancer screening recommendations offers readers a reasonably faithful summary of the key conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The key point of the new guidelines is that several methods of screening all work pretty well for people ages 50-to-75, yet many Americans don’t get screened. Unfortunately, the article doesn’t do much to inform the reader beyond the task force’s news release (available for download here), only stating that “there are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations.” While it may be cumbersome to explain those benefits and risks in detail, it still would have been useful to go over some of the specifics, such as risks and costs, so that people get a basic idea of some of the complex trade-offs at hand. While cancer screening doesn’t always produce clear benefits, the USPSTF concludes colon cancer screening does offer substantial benefits for most people between the ages of 50 and 75. Given the high rates of colon cancer in the U.S., this is important news to convey to the public.",Expert Panel Reaffirms Need for Colon Cancer Screen Beginning at Age 50,"This is a story about a panel of experts that has reaffirmed its recommendation that people at average risk of colon cancer should begin screening at age 50. The story does a good job of explaining the panel’s work and the strength of the recommendation. However, the story could have done more to explain what sets this recommendation apart from other reports and why it should be trusted. The story also could have done more to explain the costs of screening, the potential harms of screening, and the effectiveness of different screening methods. The story also could have done more to explain the options available to people. For example, an average-risk person who is informed about the screening may choose not to be screened as a reasonable choice, but only as part of a shared decision-making process with their doctor."
1008,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Illinois Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford that the novel coronavirus was ""man-made."" Lightford suggested that someone created the virus in a lab and that they should now be trying to find a solution to the pandemic. However, leading experts and scientific research have debunked this claim.

According to an article published in Nature Medicine, the genetic structure of the coronavirus does not indicate that it was altered or created in a lab. The researchers present two plausible explanations for the origin of the virus: natural selection in an animal host or natural selection in humans after the virus spread from animals. While this finding does not rule out the theory that the virus may have escaped from a lab in China, the known evidence makes it clear that the virus itself is not the result of human tampering.

Experts from various research and public health institutions, including the World Health Organization and Dr. Anthony Fauci, have stated that the most likely explanation for the virus is that it originated in animals. U.S. intelligence officials also support this view.

When contacted about her claim, Lightford admitted that she had no evidence to support her assertion that the virus was created by humans. She clarified that it was her opinion and she was speaking generally.

In conclusion, the claim that the novel coronavirus was ""man-made"" is not accurate. Scientific research and expert consensus indicate that the virus originated in animals and was not created or manipulated in a lab.
Claim: The novel coronavirus was “man-made.”
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:

1009,"### Context: State Rep. Jay Hottinger claims that Wendy's founder, Dave Thomas, left Ohio on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax. However, PolitiFact Ohio investigated this claim and found that it is not accurate. Dave Thomas died in 2002 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he had been living since 1982. He had retired as CEO of Wendy's at age 49 and moved to Florida primarily to enjoy year-round golfing and cruising on his yacht. Thomas had lived in Ohio for 20 years prior to his move to Florida. While it is possible that he wanted to limit his estate tax exposure, it is unlikely that this was his primary motivation for moving.

Thomas was a generous philanthropist and supported various organizations and causes in both Florida and Ohio. He was also involved in advocating for adoption tax credits at both the state and federal levels. There is no evidence to suggest that Thomas would have left tax and estate planning until the last minute, as he was knowledgeable about taxes and had supported tax-related legislation in the past.

PolitiFact Rhode Island has found that estate taxes have little to no impact on people's decisions to move from one state to another. The National Tax Journal also published research in 2006 that found no evidence of elderly individuals responding to changes in estate taxes by moving. Kail Padquitt, a staff economist for The Tax Foundation, stated that he has not seen any proof that the prospect of paying estate taxes drives people to relocate.

Furthermore, Hottinger's claim that Thomas left the state ""literally on his deathbed"" to avoid the estate tax is inaccurate and ridiculous. Thomas had been living in Florida for 20 years before his death, and it is worth noting that Florida also had an estate tax until 2005.

In conclusion, the claim made by State Rep. Jay Hottinger that Dave Thomas left Ohio on his deathbed to avoid the estate tax is not supported by the facts. Thomas had been living in Florida for two decades before his death and had various reasons for moving, including his love for golf and boating. Estate taxes have been found to have little impact on people's decisions to move, and there is no evidence to suggest that Thomas made his move solely to avoid the tax.

1010,"### Context: The department said Friday that the new cases bring the number of such illnesses among Connecticut residents reported since August to 34, though the specific cause of the injuries is not yet known. Twenty-six patients reported vaping with THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana, 90 days before becoming sick. Of those cases, 17 were in Fairfield, nine in New Haven, three in New London and two in Hartford, and one in Litchfield, Tolland and Windham counties. One person in Connecticut has died. The CDC said Thursday 33 people have died of lung injuries associated with vaping products in 24 states.

1011,"### Context: The article titled ""Compound May Fight Hard-to-Treat Lung Cancer"" discusses a new compound that shows promise in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is resistant to other drugs. The article mentions that the compound is still in the early phase of research and that its safety profile in humans has yet to be established. It also highlights that there are no discussions about the potential costs or harms associated with the compound.

The article provides accurate data on lung cancer mortality and NSCLC from the American Cancer Society (ACS), but it does not cite any independent sources besides the ACS statistics. The lack of independent perspective is concerning, especially when the researcher claims that this research ""will lead to an effective treatment for the thousands of non-small cell lung cancer patients worldwide.""

The article mentions that the compound is being developed for NSCLCs that are resistant to two other drugs, but it does not clarify if those two drugs are the only available treatment options for patients who might receive the new compound.

Towards the end of the article, it is revealed that the dramatic results against NSCLC tumors were achieved in mice, not human beings. This information is crucial, as the article fails to mention that some results were achieved in cell lines, not even in mice, according to the press release and article published in Nature.

Overall, the article is misleading as it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence beyond what was mentioned in the press release. It also fails to mention the setting for the results, leading readers to assume that the treatment effects were observed in humans. The article lacks important information about the compound's potential liabilities and the fact that the evidence is not from humans.

In conclusion, the article highlights a new compound that shows promise in treating hard-to-treat NSCLC, but it fails to provide a balanced perspective, independent sources, and crucial information about the research being in early stages and the results being observed in mice and cell lines, not humans.

The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"It took until 268 words deep into a 383 word story to learn that the ""Compound May Fight Hard-to-Treat Lung Cancer"" story was not about human research. This article commits one of the cardinal sins of health journalism: it downplays the fact that the research was not done in humans. The unchallenged projections about the potential applications for patients are premature.",Compound May Fight Hard-to-Treat Lung Cancer,"This story is a classic example of how a news organization can be fooled by a news release. The story is based on a news release from the University of Michigan, which in turn is based on a paper published in the journal Nature. But the story is misleading because it fails to make clear that the results were not from humans, but from mice and cell lines. The headline, """"Compound May Fight Hard-to-Treat Lung Cancer,"""" is misleading because the compound has not been shown to """"fight"""" lung cancer in humans. The story also fails to provide a balanced evaluation of the evidence, and fails to provide an independent perspective.

1012,"### Context: The article discusses the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a treatment for radiation side effects in a cancer survivor. It mentions that Medicare covers the treatment at $450 for a two-hour session, but does not discuss whether other insurance programs cover it. The cost of the entire treatment plan for the patient and whether it was covered by insurance is not mentioned. The article focuses on one patient's subjective account of pain relief and does not provide a quantitative assessment of the evidence supporting the treatment. It cautions about the lack of evidence and rigorous medical studies supporting the use of hyperbaric chamber therapy outside of common uses. The article mentions the potential overuse of the treatment but does not explicitly mention the harms associated with it. It highlights the story of a desperate patient in a balanced way and does not commit disease mongering. The sources in the article, except for one reference to Kaiser Health News, have connections to the patient. The article mentions that physical therapy and pain medication are standard treatments for delayed radiation effects and describes the challenges of managing them. It states that hyperbaric chambers are located in about 1,400 hospitals across the US and that access to the therapy is likely relatively easy. The article also mentions that hyperbaric therapy has been around since the 1900s and is not a novel procedure. It does not appear that the story relied on a news release.
Claim: Hyperbaric oxygen: The mysterious therapy that saved a cancer survivor from radiation side effects
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This well-written article discusses a patient suffering from delayed effects of radiation who received hyperbaric therapy treatment. The patient noticed improvements in pain levels and mobility, but doctors in the story warn that this treatment is unproven to help patients with delayed radiation injury and that this type of therapy tends to be overused. Though it is gratifying to hear the patient’s words and the hope that this treatment has provided him, it actually isn’t clear whether the hyperbaric oxygen itself was the reason he got better. The “placebo” effect is well described in the medical literature and refers to sham treatments (fake surgery or pills) leading to benefit. It may also be that the treatment really did help but not for the reasons cited–maybe simply sitting still for hours helped tissues to heal. We do wish the story had explored this aspect more. Overuse of unproven medical technologies poses risks to patients and adds to rising healthcare costs. An N of 1 does not prove that a technology works since there are so many other factors that could contribute to a patient seeing improvement over time.",Hyperbaric oxygen: The mysterious therapy that saved a cancer survivor from radiation side effects,This is a story about a single patient who says she was helped by a treatment called hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The story does a good job of describing the treatment and its potential harms. It also does a good job of describing the evidence behind the treatment. The story could have been improved by including a discussion of the costs of the treatment and by describing the costs to the individual patient. The story also could have been improved by including a discussion of the quality of the evidence supporting the use of the treatment.

1013,"### Context: The claim that individuals with a high net worth are ineligible to serve in the military due to a propensity for insubordination is not supported by evidence. While it is true that the majority of active servicemen and women come from modest means, there are examples of wealthy individuals who have served in the military. For example, Senator John McCain's son, James McCain, served in the Marine Corps and went to Iraq. Similarly, all four of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.'s sons served in the military despite their family's wealth and fame.

There have been cases where individuals who won the lottery or received sudden wealth were discharged from the military. For instance, a sailor aboard the USS Nimitz won $6.5 million in the lottery and was discharged from the Navy. However, these cases do not indicate that high net worth individuals are prohibited from serving. Rather, sudden wealth can disrupt a military career, and the military has systems in place to allow individuals to request discharge in such situations.

Military forms and guidance also support the idea that requests for discharge due to a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" will be considered if it is in the best interests of the Army, not necessarily the individual. However, these provisions do not specifically bar wealthy individuals from serving.

In conclusion, while there are cases where individuals with sudden wealth have been discharged from the military, there is no evidence to support the claim that high net worth individuals are ineligible to serve due to a propensity for insubordination. The military has systems in place to handle situations where sudden wealth may interfere with an individual's military career, but these cases are based on individual requests and not a blanket prohibition on wealthy individuals serving.
Claim: Individuals with a high net worth are ineligible to serve in the military because they are more likely to be insubordinate.

1014,"### Context: The article discusses the risks and rewards of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a treatment for various disorders, including autism. The author criticizes the lack of discussion on costs, the number of sessions required, and the duration of treatment. The article also highlights the absence of evidence and research on the effectiveness and potential harms of TMS for autism. The author suggests that personal anecdotes are not sufficient evidence to assess the likelihood of benefit or harm in general. The article emphasizes the need for a discussion of research in this area and the inclusion of studies on TMS for other disorders, such as depression, to establish common risks and side effects. The lack of information on the duration and benefits of treatment is also criticized. The article mentions that there are no well-proven, effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder, but it does not engage in disease mongering. The article suggests that an independent source could have provided important perspectives on the treatment being discussed. It also notes that there is no discussion of alternative treatments or general options for people with autism. While TMS is available for the treatment of depression, its use for autism is still considered novel and not recommended. The article concludes by stating that the story was based on an interview with the author and his doctor and did not rely on a news release.

The claim was debunked by WLKY, who posted on their Facebook page that the report was false and created by React365.com. The prank website reacted to WLKY's post by deleting the station's call letters and logo from the page, but the fake article remained intact.

It is important to note that the claim's credibility was already suspect due to the poor grammar and misspellings in the report. Additionally, the fact that the report was not published on WLKY's official website further indicated its falsity.

1016,"### Context: Acting state Supreme Court Justice Catherine Cholakis has ruled that the state Public Health and Health Planning Council exceeded its authority when it issued a ban on flavored e-cigarettes and e-liquids, limiting them to only tobacco or menthol flavors. Cholakis stated that regulating the vaping industry is the responsibility of the state Legislature, not the executive branch. The ban was challenged by the Vapor Technology Association and two of its member businesses, who argued that it would force vaping businesses to close across the state. The judge granted their request for an injunction against enforcing the ban.

Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has referred to vaping as a public health crisis and accused vaping companies of targeting young people with flavors like cotton candy and bubble gum. Last month, Cuomo announced his intention to introduce legislation that would ban flavored nicotine e-cigarette products and vaping advertisements aimed at youth. The legislation would also give the state Department of Health the power to ban the sale of vaping carrier oils that have been linked to respiratory ailments.

Cuomo's spokesman called Cholakis' decision ""unfortunate"" but acknowledged that the judge recognized the seriousness of the vaping issue. The spokesman stated that they are reviewing the decision and considering their options, but will continue to move forward with comprehensive legislation to address public health concerns related to vaping.

The Vapor Technology Association has not yet commented on the ruling.

The urgency to regulate e-cigarettes has increased in recent months due to the rise of vaping-related illnesses nationwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of December 17, over 2,500 people in the United States have reported respiratory issues linked to vaping, and 54 deaths have been confirmed.

In summary, a judge has blocked New York's ban on flavored vaping products, ruling that the state Public Health and Health Planning Council overstepped its authority. Governor Cuomo plans to introduce legislation to ban flavored nicotine e-cigarettes and vaping advertisements, as well as empower the state Department of Health to ban certain vaping carrier oils. The decision comes amid a nationwide increase in vaping-related illnesses and deaths.

1019,"### Context: President Donald Trump claimed that during a press conference on March 13, 2020, the stock market set an all-time record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average did experience a record surge on that day, gaining 1,985 points, which was its biggest point gain ever. The surge accelerated during Trump's news conference. However, it is important to note that this record came a day after the steepest decline ever, with the Dow plummeting 10% on March 12. The gains made on March 13 were wiped out the following trading day. 

During the press conference, Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency and announced measures such as greater availability of testing and the purchase of oil for the strategic petroleum reserve. These steps may have contributed to the stock market's surge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started at 21,747.52 at the beginning of the speech and closed at 23,175.92, gaining 1,428 points over the course of the speech. This gain itself was larger than the previous record for the largest point gain in a day.

While the stock market did experience a significant increase during Trump's press conference, it is important to consider the context. The gains were a recovery from the previous day's record decline, and they were short-lived as the market dropped significantly the following trading day. Experts also caution that the stock market is not a direct reflection of the overall economy and that sharp rises and declines are common during times of economic stress.

Trump's claim that the stock market set an all-time record during his press conference is partially accurate but leaves out important details. The gains made were in response to a previous record decline, and they were not sustained. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

1020,"### Context: The claim that recently-arrived asylum seekers are perpetrating the majority of crime in Sweden is not supported by the article. The article states that most violence in Sweden cannot be linked to asylum seekers. Instead, it explains that economic stagnation in immigrant communities that formed decades ago has resulted in intergenerational poverty, which has fueled the proliferation of street gangs. Unemployment is higher and education levels lower in certain neighborhoods, such as Herrgården in Malmö, which is considered the most dangerous part of Rosengård. The article emphasizes that crime in these areas stems from Sweden's failure to integrate previous generations of immigrants.

The article also highlights that crime in Sweden is not a result of recently-arrived refugees, but rather an iteration of gang violence that has been ongoing since the 1990s. Motorcycle gangs like Hell's Angels and Bandidos were the first wave of gang organization in Sweden, followed by the children of people who fled the Balkan war. The current violence in these areas is attributed to a power vacuum in the organized crime community and the younger ""third wave"" of children of immigrants who are trying to establish themselves. This third wave is characterized by its chaotic nature, loose structure, and disconnection from wider society.

The article mentions that Sweden's governmental agency that conducts crime research, Brå, has not performed a study on the nationality of crime suspects since 2005 due to legal restrictions. However, the 2005 study found that people with non-Swedish backgrounds were 2.5 times more likely to be crime suspects. The article also cites a Stockholm University finding that parental socioeconomic resources and neighborhood segregation play a decisive role in criminal activity, rather than immigrants' country of origin or shared cultural factors.

While the article acknowledges that there has been an increase in homicides connected to a criminal milieu and an increase in the proportion of cases perpetrated with guns, it states that overall crime figures in Sweden have been trending down since 2005. The proportion of people who say they have been victims of any crime during the year has declined, as well as the proportion of households victimized by property crimes.

In conclusion, the article refutes the claim that recently-arrived asylum seekers are perpetrating the majority of crime in Sweden. It highlights the role of economic stagnation, intergenerational poverty, and gang violence in certain immigrant communities as the main factors contributing to crime in Sweden.

1021,"### Context: Carolyn Tuft, a survivor of a mass shooting in 2007, is dealing with the long-term effects of lead poisoning from the ammunition used in the shooting. Tuft's 15-year-old daughter died in the Trolley Square mall shooting in Salt Lake City. Since then, Tuft has been unable to work, resulting in the loss of her home and business. She experiences physical and emotional pain, struggling to get up in the morning and get dressed. Tuft's friend, Mary Anne Thompson, who is a local chapter leader of Moms Demand Action, has witnessed the devastating effects on Tuft's life.

Lead poisoning from ammunition is a topic that has received little research attention. Once lead enters the body, it can travel through the bloodstream and affect vital organs, such as the kidneys, brain, and heart, leading to serious health issues like kidney disease, depression, heart disease, and suicidal thoughts. Gabriel Filippelli, a science professor at Indiana University, emphasizes the need for more research on the impacts of lead poisoning from ammunition.

Michael J. Kosnett, a medical toxicologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, explains that retained lead bullets or fragments can cause elevated lead levels in the blood, making individuals feel sick. However, even those with lower lead levels who do not experience symptoms could still be at risk of long-term health effects.

Tuft was shot multiple times during the Trolley Square mall shooting, resulting in her suffering from lead poisoning. She supports measures such as a ban on assault weapons, stronger background checks, and proposed ""red flag"" laws, but does not favor total gun bans. Tuft expresses her frustration at how a mass shooting not only takes lives but also destroys livelihoods and dreams.

Overall, the article highlights the personal struggles of Carolyn Tuft, a survivor of a mass shooting, who is dealing with the long-term effects of lead poisoning from the ammunition used in the shooting. It also emphasizes the need for more research on the impacts of lead poisoning from ammunition and the importance of implementing measures to prevent mass shootings.

1024,"### Context: During President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2019, a rumor circulated that Queen Elizabeth II wore a Burmese Ruby Tiara as a sign of disrespect towards the American leader. The tiara, commissioned in 1973 by the House of Garrard, features 96 rubies given to the Queen as a wedding gift from the people of Burma. The rubies were intended to symbolize protection against evil and illness.

The Court Jeweler blog further explained that the Burmese people believe that rubies can protect the wearer from the 96 diseases that can afflict the human body. The tiara was made with these rubies and diamonds, set in a series of rose motifs, including the Tudor rose, which combines white and red petals.

Contrary to the claim that Queen Elizabeth wore the tiara as a slight against President Trump, she has worn it on numerous occasions since its commission in 1973. She has worn it while meeting various world leaders, including South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, India's President Pratibha Patil, Slovenia's President Danilo Turk, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and French President François Mitterrand. The tiara has also been worn during celebratory events such as her silver jubilee in 1977.

Additionally, Queen Elizabeth wore the tiara for an official portrait in 1992, which was subsequently used on the face of the £10 and £20 banknotes from St. Helena.

The fact that Queen Elizabeth has worn the Burmese Ruby Tiara on multiple occasions and in the presence of various world leaders suggests that those claiming she wore it as a slight against President Trump may be projecting their own political beliefs rather than accurately interpreting the Queen's intentions.

1025,"### Context: The article discusses the effectiveness of the Provenge vaccine in prolonging the lives of prostate cancer patients. It mentions that the cost of the treatment has not been announced, but fails to mention that other biotech treatments for cancer can cost thousands of dollars per month. The article does report that 32 percent of men receiving Provenge were alive three years later, compared to 23 percent of men who received placebo infusions. However, it does not explain that the four-month survival advantage mentioned in the lead sentence is derived from comparing the median survival of 26 months among men in the treatment arm to 22 months among men in the placebo arm of the trial.

The article features the founder of a prostate cancer patient advocacy group who claims to know men who have died waiting for Provenge to be approved. This statement gives an exaggerated sense of the effect of the treatment, as more than two-thirds of the men receiving Provenge died within three years and there was no effect on disease progression.

The article mentions that 1 percent of study participants dropped out due to side effects, with the most common problems being short-term chills, fever, and headache. However, it fails to provide a complete listing of side effects observed in the trial.

The article should have noted that Provenge was denied approval two years ago due to concerns about possible side effects, including a possible increase in stroke risk, even though no difference was seen in this trial.

The article does not directly compare Provenge to standard treatment with chemotherapy, as the study used a placebo control. It also fails to emphasize that this treatment has not yet been shown to improve outcomes for men earlier in the course of the disease.

The article mentions another experimental prostate cancer vaccine that extended survival by more than eight months, which contradicts the claim that Provenge is the first cancer vaccine to extend survival.

The article quotes a researcher not connected with the trial, but fails to mention that the company developing the drug paid for the trial and that the lead researcher quoted in the story owns stock in the company.

While the article mentions that chemotherapy is the standard treatment for similar patients, it does not make it clear that the new therapy has not been directly compared to standard chemotherapy.

The article states that the company plans to apply for FDA approval later this year and highlights that Provenge is the first cancer vaccine to demonstrate a survival benefit. However, it fails to mention that the same treatment was denied approval two years ago.

Overall, the article lacks important information and may give readers an exaggerated sense of the effectiveness of Provenge as a treatment for prostate cancer.

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This story provides many of the key details readers need to understand the results of the trial of Provenge – being evaluated as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer – but the overall tone of the story emphasizes the good news while soft-peddling the caveats. Even though the story points out that only a third of men receiving the experimental approach were alive three years after they entered the trial, it would be understandable if readers concluded that Provenge is a dramatic advance in prostate cancer treatment and offers substantial advantages, with no disadavantages, compared to the chemotherapy typically offered similar patients. This USA Today story was about half the length of the AP report we also reviewed. Important facts were omitted that undercut the usefulness of the story; for example, the failure to note that the lead researcher owns stock in the company developing the drug or that the FDA declined to approve this drug two years ago because of concerns about potential side effects and questions about its actual effectiveness. While some cancer experts quoted elsewhere termed the trial findings an ""incremental"" advance, all of the comments included in this story portrayed the results as a dramatic advance.

1026,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Rep. Mary González that an abortion procedure is safer than a vasectomy. The claim is based on figures from a Texas Tribune news story and a Kentucky report. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, fewer than 1 percent of Texas abortions in 2014 resulted in any complications for the woman. The overall number of abortions in Texas had decreased due to changes in law that imposed safety standards for clinics and required physician-providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. 

In contrast, a 2006 article by two Kentucky physicians states that the incidence of complications from vasectomies can be as high as 15 percent. The article mentions that a no-scalpel vasectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of complications compared to the incision technique. A chart in the article shows varied complication rates of 0.2 percent to 15.9 percent, depending on the method used.

When the author of the article reached out to the Texas Department of State Health Services, they stated that they do not track complications from vasectomies. However, they provided data on abortion complications in Texas, which showed that less than one-tenth of 1 percent of abortion procedures in Texas resulted in complications.

The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health and abortion rights nonprofit, provided information stating that a first-trimester abortion carries a risk of less than 0.05 percent of major complications that might require hospital care. A review of 57 studies of abortion complications published from 1980 through April 2015 found that major complications following first-trimester abortions were very rare.

Regarding vasectomy complications, a 2005 analysis of worldwide evidence stated that vasectomy, while safe and relatively simple, requires a high level of expertise to minimize complications. The analysis mentioned a 2 percent chance of hematoma and an average 3.4 percent chance of infection. Another article from the Canadian Urological Association described varied complication rates from vasectomies, including infection, bleeding, and chronic scrotal pain.

In conclusion, the claim made by Rep. Mary González that an abortion procedure is safer than a vasectomy is supported by the available data. Abortion procedures have lower complication rates compared to vasectomies, although both procedures are generally considered safe with rare complications.

1027,"### Context: According to a press release from Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed's office, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking, despite the national smoking rate falling. The press release was part of the launch of a statewide campaign called ""Nobody Quits Like Georgia,"" which aims to help Georgia smokers quit by connecting them with counseling and support. The campaign is sponsored by the American Lung Association.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that smoking leads to various diseases and disabilities and harms almost every organ in the body. It estimates that over 16 million Americans have a smoking-related disease, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The financial toll of smoking in the United States is estimated to be over $300 billion per year, including direct medical care costs and lost productivity.

The press release from Mayor Reed's office cited a statistic from the American Lung Association that 18.8 percent of Georgia adults were identified as smokers in 2013. However, newer data from the Georgia Department of Public Health shows that the adult smoking rate in Georgia had fallen to 17.4 percent in 2014. The rate of smoking among young adults aged 18 to 24 also decreased to 16.4 percent.

The CDC spokesperson mentioned that although the smoking prevalence in Georgia has been declining, the progress has not been as robust as it could have been. They believe that interventions such as higher tobacco prices, comprehensive smoke-free laws, mass media campaigns, and sustained funding for tobacco control programs have not been fully implemented in Georgia.

The director of chronic disease prevention for the Georgia Department of Public Health mentioned that the tobacco-free schools program, which is now in 105 out of 181 school districts in the state, has contributed to the decline in smoking rates among young adults. The University System in Georgia has also implemented a smoke-free policy at its colleges and universities.

In conclusion, while the national smoking rate has been decreasing, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia still smoke. However, the smoking rate in Georgia has shown a decline, particularly among young adults. The state has implemented various programs and policies to reduce smoking rates, but there is still work to be done.
Claim: While the smoking rate nationally has fallen, more than 18 percent of Georgians still light up.

The first part of the statement is misleading. Smoking rates have generally been falling nationally and in Georgia. The state’s rate was lower than the national rate in 2013. Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state.

1029,"### Context: National conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly claims that broken compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) allegedly cause migraines and epilepsy attacks. To investigate this claim, the author reached out to various experts and conducted research. 

The author first contacted Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle Forum, who sent the email blast containing Schlafly's column. They also found Schlafly's original column on WorldNetDaily.com and requested further information. They then searched for news stories on CFLs causing migraines and epileptic episodes and found an opinion column by Nicolas Loris, a research associate for the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation. Loris cited a 2009 article from The Daily Mail, which quoted ""medical charities"" stating that CFL bulbs can trigger migraines and epilepsy attacks. These charities were lobbying the government for an exemption for people with health problems.

The author then consulted experts on migraines and epilepsy. Stephen Silberstein, a professor of neurology, stated that while a flickering light can aggravate a headache, there is no evidence that CFLs cause migraines. Marc Nuwer, a professor of clinical neurology, explained that CFL bulbs flicker at rates not detectable by the human eye and do not cause epileptic seizures. He speculated that a broken light flashing at a specific frequency could potentially trigger seizures, but this is different from the bright, room-lighting effect of a strobe light.

The author also contacted Graham Harding, an international expert on photosensitive epilepsy, who reported that a small percentage of respondents in an online survey experienced seizures due to CFL bulbs. However, Harding noted that the risk was no greater than with normal fluorescent bulbs and that the UK's Epilepsy Action group had not reported any seizure problems related to CFLs.

Mark Rea, director of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Lighting Research Center, stated that he had not seen any US studies demonstrating headaches or epileptic attacks caused by CFLs. He mentioned a 1989 study from the UK that found a reduction in eye strain and headaches when high-frequency lights were used.

Finally, the author referred to a paper adopted by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, which stated that there is no scientific evidence that CFLs induce seizures or aggravate migraines.

In conclusion, while flickering lights have been linked to migraines and epileptic seizures, there is no scientific evidence to support Schlafly's claim that broken CFL bulbs cause these conditions.

1030,"### Context: The article discusses the accuracy of a claim made by Charlie Crist, a Democrat, about Republican Governor Rick Scott's record on abortion. Crist's claim is that Scott signed ""laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."" The article confirms that Scott did sign a law in 2011 that requires all women to receive an ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. The law also gives women the opportunity to review the ultrasound and have it explained to them, although they can decline to review it if they sign a form. Previously, ultrasounds were only required for second trimester or later abortions. The article also confirms that Scott signed a law in 2014 that changed the timeline for cutting off abortions. The new law banned abortions once a fetus is considered viable, which is typically around 23 or 24 weeks of gestation. The previous law banned abortions in the third trimester, but included a broad exception to ""preserve the health of the pregnant woman,"" which some interpreted to potentially include rape or incest survivors. However, no woman has received a third-trimester abortion under any exception between 2011 and 2014. The article also mentions that Florida had restrictive abortion laws before Scott took office and that the state has not experienced widespread clinic closures. The article concludes that Crist's claim is accurate, but needs additional information.

Scott signed a law in 2011 that requires ultrasounds for all women before they get an abortion, and in 2014 he signed a law that stated women could not have an abortion after the point of viability. That means women could not have an abortion about two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life. However, the previous law didn’t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester.

1031,"### Context: JUST, a San Francisco-based food company, is planning to expand its plant-based egg product, JUST Egg, to Europe in the next few months. The company aims to become one of the lowest-cost proteins globally, with a goal of reducing the cost of JUST Egg from 22 cents per serving to 12 cents next year and ultimately below five cents. The demand for plant-based foods is growing rapidly as consumers become more concerned about the environmental impact of meat production and seek alternative protein sources. JUST Egg is made from mung beans and is currently available in the United States, Canada, China, and Singapore, with sales evenly split between retailers such as Walmart, Safeway, and Whole Foods, and restaurants like Tim Hortons. The company's CEO, Josh Tetrick, believes that cutting costs is crucial for broader acceptance of plant-based proteins. The cheapest supermarket eggs from non-caged hens cost around 16 cents each. Tetrick also mentioned that profitability is the next logical step for the company, and he is considering a possible listing to raise funds. JUST has already raised approximately $250 million from investors worldwide, including Mitsui, Temasek, China Construction Bank, Founders Fund, the Benioff family, and the Heineken family. The company has hired Dave Wagstaff, a longtime food industry executive, to head its European team. JUST's partners in Europe include Eurovo, a Italian egg company responsible for manufacturing and distribution, as well as German poultry group PHW and online food delivery platform Delivery Hero. Investors are taking notice of the growth in plant-based foods, as demonstrated by the success of U.S. startup Beyond Meat, whose stock has nearly tripled since going public in May. Tetrick is confident that JUST can capture a portion of the $260 billion global egg market if executed correctly. The company expects low- to mid-double-digit million dollar revenues this year and aims to multiply sales by around seven next year. The most important financial objective for JUST is operating profitability, which Tetrick believes they will achieve within the next year.

1032,"### Context: The claim that President Trump has banned welfare for illegal immigrants and that it will save $57.4 billion a year is inaccurate. Immigrants living in the country illegally and those on non-immigrant visas are generally not eligible for federal public benefits, even before Trump became president. The Trump administration did issue a rule in August 2019 that broadened the government's ability to deny visas and permanent-resident status to immigrants who receive public benefits or may need assistance after their arrival. However, this rule targets people seeking legal admission and those applying for permanent residency, not illegal immigrants. 

The Facebook post does not specify the source of the $57.4 billion figure, but it mirrors a headline on a Breitbart story. The story, however, was about legal immigration. A study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine estimated that the annual fiscal cost of first-generation immigrants and their dependents was $57.4 billion, but this figure referred to state and local expenses, not federal costs or benefits. The main cost was education, and it included both immigrants here legally and illegally. The study did not differentiate between legal and illegal immigrants.

In summary, the claim that President Trump has banned welfare for illegal immigrants and that it will save $57.4 billion a year is inaccurate. Immigrants living illegally in the United States are already ineligible for most federal assistance programs. The Trump administration's rule targets legal immigrants and those applying for permanent residency who receive public benefits. The $57.4 billion figure comes from a study on the fiscal costs of first-generation immigrants and their dependents, but it refers to state and local expenses, not federal costs or benefits, and includes both legal and illegal immigrants.

1033,"### Context: The claim made by Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, that 174 Democrats voted against a ""bipartisan act to stop convicted terrorists and sexual predators from becoming TSA Agents"" is misleading. The bill in question, H.R. 1140, known as the ""Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020,"" was actually a Democratic-led effort to grant employees of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) the same protections as other federal employees. The bill aimed to address issues such as low pay, high attrition rates, and limited workplace protections for TSA employees.

The bill was not bipartisan and did not specifically target convicted terrorists and sexual predators from becoming TSA agents. However, during the debate on the bill, concerns were raised about potential implications for TSA's ability to discipline employees involved in security violations. Committee Republicans argued that the bill could hinder TSA's national security mission and limit the agency's ability to address serious instances of misconduct.

In response to these concerns, Rep. Debbie Lesko made a motion to recommit with instructions to add an amendment related to the TSA's hiring of individuals convicted of certain crimes. The amendment aimed to ensure that the TSA continues to prevent the hiring of individuals convicted of sex crimes, offenses involving minors, violence, or terrorism. However, it did not create any new protections as existing TSA regulations already disqualify individuals convicted of such offenses.

The vote that Kirk cited was not a vote on the bill itself but rather a roll call vote on Lesko's motion to recommit with instructions. The 174 Democrats who voted against the motion were seeking to prevent additional amendments to the bill. Democratic critics argued that Lesko's amendment was unnecessary as the TSA already conducts rigorous background checks and will continue to do so.

In summary, Kirk's claim that 174 Democrats voted against a bipartisan act to stop convicted terrorists and sexual predators from becoming TSA agents is misleading. The bill in question aimed to provide TSA employees with the same protections as other federal employees and did not specifically target convicted terrorists and sexual predators. The amendment proposed during the debate sought to maintain existing safeguards against hiring individuals convicted of certain crimes, but it did not create any new protections.

1034,"### Context: The claim that murder is the primary cause of death for pregnant women is partially true. According to a study cited by Kyleen Wright, president of the anti-abortion Texans for Life Coalition, about three out of every 100,000 pregnant or postpartum women are murdered, while two out of every 100,000 kill themselves. This study also found that half of the women who died violently had conflicts with current or former partners. The study suggests that homicide accounts for more deaths than specific individual complications of pregnancy, such as hemorrhage or preeclampsia. However, it is important to note that the study did not consider all possible causes of death for pregnant women, such as car accidents.

Another study led by Cynthia Berg of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the overall death rate of women from all pregnancy-related complications was 14.5 per 100,000 live births. This study included deaths from medical complications during pregnancy or within a year afterward. Of the reported deaths, 4,200 were due to medical complications, 880 were due to motor vehicle accidents, and 617 were due to murder.

While the Palladino study suggests that murder is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated deaths, it is not the leading cause when compared to medical complications and vehicle accidents. Medical complications and vehicle accidents were found to be more prevalent causes of death for pregnant women. Additionally, national statistics on homicide among all women of reproductive age show that homicide is similar in prevalence for pregnant and non-pregnant women.

In conclusion, while murder is a significant cause of death for pregnant women, it is not the primary cause. Medical complications and vehicle accidents are more prevalent causes of death. Therefore, the claim that murder is the chief cause of death for pregnant women is partially true.

1035,"### Context: The article titled ""Medicating Children With ADHD Keeps Them Safer"" discusses a study that suggests medicating children with ADHD can reduce risky behavior and keep them safer. However, the article points out several important aspects that are missing from the story.

Firstly, the article highlights that the costs of the drugs and whether they are covered by insurance are not discussed. Additionally, there is no information provided about the duration of the medication, such as how long children would have to take them.

The article also criticizes the lack of absolute numbers in the story. While the story provides percentages, it fails to provide actual numbers related to outcomes. The article mentions that in a sample of about 14,000 teens diagnosed with ADHD, the study translates into 512 fewer teens contracting an STD, 998 fewer having a substance abuse disorder, and 6,122 fewer yearly injury cases for children and teens under 19 years old.

Furthermore, the article points out that there is no mention of the potential harms of the drugs. It questions whether the benefits outweigh the adverse effects, which is crucial information that should have been included.

The study itself is a retrospective review of data from Medicaid in one state, but the article argues that readers need more details to determine the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from this type of data review. It emphasizes that this kind of study cannot prove that medicating kids with ADHD reduces risky behavior or keeps them safer.

The article also criticizes the lack of independent sources in the piece. It suggests that the article straddles the line between commentary and news, and would have benefited from references to work outside of this one study.

Additionally, the article highlights that there is no mention of alternatives to medication for ADHD treatment. It points out that obtaining the prescribed drugs can be difficult due to the complex behavioral health system and prescription drug payment policies in the US.

Lastly, the article mentions that the story does not establish the novelty of the findings. While the news release states that previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of medications in treating the core symptoms of ADHD, little has been known about the effects of treatment on health, behavioral, and educational outcomes in the long run.

In conclusion, the article criticizes the lack of important information and context in the story about medicating children with ADHD. It highlights the need for more comprehensive reporting, including costs, potential harms, alternative treatments, and independent sources.
Claim: Medicating Children With ADHD Keeps Them Safer
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This article reports on new findings that link medicating kids with ADHD to “safer” behaviors as they get older. The story clearly takes the viewpoint that this is the case, and yet we aren’t given enough evidence from the study itself–or other studies alluded to–to make this assessment for ourselves. Instead, we’re given partial “truth-isms” like this statement, which doesn’t really paint the full picture: “Accidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with ADHD.” What’s missing? That’s also true for kids who don’t have ADHD, with “unintentional injury” being the top cause of death among all U.S. kids–and young adults, too. If it were clear that this was an opinion piece designed to advance an argument, we’d be more forgiving of these shortcomings. But we found the piece in the general health section of the website (not with the opinion columns), and the headline reads like a straight news story. Readers may be confused — as we were — as to whether this is objective, balanced news or just a columnist’s attempt to persuade. The diagnosis of ADHD is common, the impact of the condition is significant and the medications used have potential for adverse effects. Controversy exists on the number of children treated, and the balance of harms/benefits–and news coverage and commentary that doesn’t acknowledge these nuances does a disservice to the concerned reader.",Medicating Children With ADHD Keeps Them Safer,"This story reports on a study that found that children and teens diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who were prescribed stimulant medications had fewer injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, and substance abuse disorders than those who were not prescribed the drugs. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s design and the limitations of the data. However, it falls short in several other areas. It doesn’t provide any quantification of the benefits of treatment, which is a major oversight. It also doesn’t provide any information on the costs of the drugs, which is important because the story suggests that the drugs are effective at reducing risky behavior.

1036,"### Context: A study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reveals that while the majority of Americans stay within the recommended alcohol limits, excessive drinking remains a significant public health problem. The study, conducted by researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, aimed to determine how many adults exceeded the advised alcohol consumption limits. Data was collected from a nationally representative survey on health and nutrition, which included 5,400 adults over the age of 21. Participants were asked about their alcohol consumption the previous day. The findings showed that 64% of men and 79% of women reported not drinking any alcohol on that day. Additionally, 18% of men and 10% of women drank within the recommended limits. However, 9% of men reported consuming three to four drinks the day before, and 8% of women reported drinking two to three alcoholic beverages. The study also found that 8% of men and 3% of women were classified as heavy drinkers, consuming five or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women. The study highlights that rates of unhealthy alcohol use in the U.S. are significant and that regularly drinking more than the recommended levels is linked to increased alcohol-related problems. Binge drinking, defined as consuming more than four drinks for men and more than three drinks for women and older adults on any one day, can increase the risk of accidents and injuries. The study also reveals that heavy drinking is not limited to the college-age population, with heavy drinkers found across all age groups. The researchers hope that the study will help individuals recognize whether they are drinking more than recommended and raise awareness about the potential health risks associated with excessive alcohol consumption.

1037,"### Context: A recent study has identified a potential biomarker for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease commonly found in athletes who have experienced repeated head trauma. The study compared the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE to the brains of 50 deceased individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 18 deceased non-athletes. The researchers found significantly higher levels of a protein called CCL11 in the brains with CTE, even when compared to the brains with Alzheimer's. They also discovered that the amount of CCL11 increased with the number of years someone played football.

However, the article raises several concerns about the study. It questions the significance of the higher levels of CCL11 and whether they are abnormal. It also highlights the potential harms of using this biomarker as a diagnostic tool, such as false-positive and false-negative results that could cause unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance. The article suggests that more research is needed to determine the clinical benefits and limitations of this biomarker.

The article notes that the study used samples from the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, which may explain why researchers are unsure if the relevant protein can be found in the blood. It also mentions that other biomarkers are being tested for diagnosing CTE but provides limited information on these alternatives.

The article acknowledges that the research is still in its early stages and quotes one of the researchers as saying, ""This is something new."" It emphasizes that the study's findings are far from clinical applications and that more work needs to be done.

However, the article is criticized for using a word-for-word quote from a news release without disclosing its source, which affects its credibility. Overall, the article rates as ""Not Satisfactory"" in terms of providing a comprehensive and clear understanding of the research findings and their implications.
Claim: Researchers identify CTE biomarker that may lead to diagnosis while alive
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The story focuses on a recent journal article that reported finding higher levels of the protein CCL11 in individuals who were posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) than was found in healthy individuals or in those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after an individual has died, and this finding is presented as a first step toward developing a diagnostic tool for CTE that can be used while patients are still alive. This is a very preliminary basic science research study and probably not worth publicizing to a general audience. As the story explains, no one really knows how relevant this finding is yet, and if it will lead to anything clinicians can use. The story at least makes that very clear, and tapped an independent source to provide context. CTE has been a huge news topic lately because of its association with professional football players. For this reason, research related to CTE is likely to get a lot of attention from readers. This one certainly did, garnering coverage from several large news media organizations (the Los Angeles Times, for example, and the New York Post (which hailed the finding “monumental”). The totality of all this coverage on a preliminary finding could leave readers with the impression the research is closer to clinical use than it really is.",Researchers identify CTE biomarker that may lead to diagnosis while alive,"This story reports on a study that identified a protein that may be a biomarker for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to repeated head trauma, such as that experienced by football players.

However, a chain message claiming that the federal government is preparing to announce a nationwide quarantine is false. There is no evidence to support this claim, and President Trump has stated that he is not considering a nationwide quarantine. The Department of Homeland Security and FEMA have not ordered the National Guard or military to be dispatched across the country. The message also misinterprets the Stafford Act, a federal disaster relief law that provides aid to state and local governments. While the law has been invoked to assist with the coronavirus response, it does not require a nationwide lockdown. Forced quarantines are historically rare, and most infected individuals are allowed to self-quarantine. State and local governments have the authority to quarantine Americans within their own borders, and the Department of Homeland Security can screen and quarantine individuals reentering the U.S. from other countries.

1040,"### Context: The claim that ""background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence"" is not entirely accurate, according to experts. While research has shown that background checks are associated with reduced gun violence, it is not scientifically established that background checks alone can reduce violence without a broader system of laws, regulations, and enforcement. 

One study by the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety compared states that require background checks for private sales to states that do not. They found that states with comprehensive background checks had a roughly 50 percent lower rate of gun violence in several categories. However, experts caution that this comparison does not control for all other variables that may differ between the two groups of states, such as relative levels of gun ownership. 

Another study looked at the effects of a Connecticut law requiring handgun purchasers to get a license on subsequent homicides. Researchers found that the law was associated with a 40 percent reduction in gun homicides. However, this reduction in gun violence could not be solely attributed to background checks, as the law was part of a larger regulatory scheme that included other provisions such as raising the legal age to buy a handgun and requiring gun safety training.

Experts agree that background checks on all gun transfers are necessary to stop prohibited people from obtaining guns. However, it has not been scientifically established that background checks alone can reduce gun violence without a broader system of laws and regulations. Stronger gun laws and fewer guns are associated with lower rates of gun violence, but the relationship between background checks and gun violence is not as clear-cut as the claim suggests.

In conclusion, while research has shown that background checks are associated with reduced gun violence, it is not scientifically established that background checks alone can reduce violence without a broader system of laws, regulations, and enforcement. The claim that background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence is not entirely accurate.

1041,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests caloric restriction may improve memory performance in older adults. The study found that the group that practiced caloric restriction saw a 20% average improvement in memory performance. However, the article does not provide information on how memory was tested or what a 20% improvement means in practical terms. It also fails to mention the number of calories the restriction group consumed on a given day. The article does mention that earlier studies have linked caloric restriction to memory decline, and it warns that older patients should not restrict their caloric intake without medical supervision due to the risk of malnutrition. It also notes that it is unknown whether caloric restriction is safe for slightly overweight or normal weight adults. The article acknowledges the limitations of the study, such as its small size and inconclusive results. However, it does not mention that caloric intake was based on self-reports, which may be unreliable, or that the improved memory may be linked to weight loss rather than caloric restriction. The article also suggests that the cognitive improvements may be related to the daily task of counting calories and logging food intake. Overall, the article is unsatisfactory in terms of providing important information and addressing potential caveats. It does not exaggerate the severity or incidence of memory loss in older adults and includes interviews with study researchers and independent experts. The article briefly discusses the history of caloric restriction testing and does not solely rely on a news release.
Claim: Another Potential Benefit of Cutting Calories: Better Memory
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This newspaper report demonstrates how it’s possible for a reporter to do a competent job covering the news but fail to provide important information for readers. The study, which demonstrates that caloric restriction may improve memory in older people, delivers the essential findings adequately, mentions some key caveats, includes comments from three experts and places these findings in the context of previous work done with animals and humans. But the report fails to look beyond the narrow findings and answer important questions people will want to know as they [understandably] imagine how they might put these findings to practical use:  1. How much/little food did the restriction group eat? A 30 percent restriction for someone eating 2,000 calories per day is 1,400 calories; for someone eating 1,700 per day, that’s 1,190. Those are tough numbers. People would want to know that. 2. Is it clear the results were due to caloric restriction, not weight loss? This is the proverbial caveat big enough to drive a truck through, yet it was not mentioned. 3. Is it safe for older people–or anybody–to restrict calories by 30 percent? The failure to take up that last question is particularly serious. Older people who are not overweight could wind up malnourished if they tried to restrict their calorie intake by 30 percent. Other news organizations mentioned this prominently in their stories. The Times should have too.",Another Potential Benefit of Cutting Calories: Better Memory,"The story reports on a small study of 36 older adults that found those who restricted their calorie intake to 75 percent of their daily calorie needs for 2 weeks had better memory performance than those who did not restrict their calorie intake.

However, the story should have been more clear about the nature of the memory tests used in the study and the magnitude of the improvement in memory performance. The story also should have been more clear about the role of weight loss in the improvement in memory performance."

However, there is more nuance to this story. While Scott did cut about $1 million for mosquito control in 2011, the state later increased the budget to about $2.7 million and it has remained at that level for four years. Scott also vetoed a one-time appropriation of $500,000 in 2011 for a mosquito lab at Florida A&M University, which then shut it down. However, the university had already decided to eliminate non-teaching units, including the mosquito lab, due to budget cuts. The state has since funded research at a different university center. Wasserman Schultz's claim that Scott is responsible for the spread of Zika is not entirely accurate, as there are no guarantees in research funding and it is not certain that more funding would have prevented the current situation.

1043,"### Context: A panel of experts in the United States is reviewing low-carb diets, along with other eating styles, for the 2020 update to the dietary guidelines. This inclusion could potentially influence the nutrition advice given by doctors and shape government food programs like school lunches. The current guidelines cite the Mediterranean, vegetarian, and other diets as examples of healthy eating. The main goal is to move away from a one-size-fits-all diet and consider individual needs.

Low-carb diets have gained support due to rising obesity rates, which suggest that conventional wisdom about nutrition does not work for everyone. However, some nutrition experts caution that evidence for low-carb diets is new and the long-term effects are unclear. They argue that criticism of the guidelines is exaggerated and blame the food industry for distorting messages to market low-fat snacks full of sugar and large portions.

Low-carb diets generally limit foods like bread, pasta, and sugar to less than 30% of calories. The idea of restricting carbohydrates has been around for decades, with the Atkins diet being a well-known example. The ketogenic diet, a very low-carb diet, has also gained popularity among celebrities.

While low-carb diets can work well for people with type 2 diabetes who are more sensitive to carbohydrates, the benefits can be overblown. People still need to ensure that their overall diet is healthy. Some nutrition experts argue that sticking to low-carb diets can be challenging and suggest making changes that can be sustained in the long term.

There are differing opinions on whether low-carb diets should be included in the guidelines. Some argue that adding another diet could further confuse the public, while others believe that simplifying the guidelines would be more useful. The current guidelines already advise limiting saturated fat, which is commonly found in meat and butter, foods often associated with low-carb diets.

In conclusion, the inclusion of low-carb diets in the dietary guidelines is being reviewed by a panel of experts. Supporters believe that this could lead to more personalized nutrition advice and influence government food programs. However, there are concerns about the newness of the evidence for low-carb diets and the need for a healthy overall diet. Some experts argue for simplifying the guidelines, while others caution against adding more confusion.

1044,"### Context: The article discusses a study conducted by researchers from Oxford University, which suggests that many people facing knee problems would benefit more from partial knee replacements rather than total knee replacements. The study found that partial replacements are not only cheaper but also allow for faster recovery. However, the article does not provide specific details on how much faster the recovery is or the benefits of the surgery compared to not having any surgery at all.

The study measured the ""quality adjusted life years"" (QALYs) gained from the surgeries, which is a way of assessing the cost-effectiveness and value of a medical procedure. The researchers found that the QALY gains varied depending on the patient's sex, age, and the frequency of the surgeon performing the partial surgery. However, the article does not mention any risks associated with either surgery or provide information on the data used in the study.

The lack of details in the article makes it difficult for readers to understand the methodology and limitations of the study. It is also unclear whether surgery is the only option for patients with knee arthritis, as the article states that osteoarthritis is the main reason for knee replacement surgery. The article does not incorporate input from independent sources and quotes from the study authors are taken from a news release without attribution.

The article mentions that partial knee replacement surgery is available and not the first study to evaluate its outcomes. However, it does not provide any comparison with previous studies or discuss the significance of this new study. The information in the article appears to come solely from a news release issued by the study authors' research institution, without crediting the release.

In conclusion, the article provides limited information on the study and its findings. It lacks details on the benefits, risks, methodology, and data used in the research. The article also does not provide a comprehensive analysis or comparison with previous studies on the topic.
Claim: Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This story parrots a news release sent out by Oxford University about a study published in the journal BMJ Open. The study concludes that partial knee replacements would — in many cases — leave patients “better off” than total knee replacements. With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were. It also didn’t discuss harms of surgery, among other problems. An over-reliance on publicity materials appears to be a pattern — last week the Guardian received a 1-star score from us for a different story that also simply restated what the news release said. Knee replacement surgeries are not uncommon. A 2015 study reported that, as of 2010, there were 4.7 million people in the U.S. who had received a total knee replacement. If partial knee replacement (also called a unicompartmental knee replacement, or UKR) is an option for many patients, and the partial version could improve outcomes and reduce medical costs, then this is a finding with the potential to significantly improve life for patients (and make U.S. insurers happier in the process). However, it’s important to highlight the risks associated with such a decision — even if those risks could potentially be reduced by seeing an increase in partial replacement surgeries over time. The importance of this research is that for some people a less-invasive surgical procedure may be an option, but the choice isn’t quite so clearcut as the researchers imply.",Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report,"This story reports on a study that compared two types of knee replacement surgery: total and partial. The study found that partial knee replacement surgery is a better option for many patients, as it is less invasive and allows for faster recovery.

1045,"### Context: On February 7, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned about the limited stock of personal protective equipment (PPE). On the same day, the Trump administration announced that it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns, and respirators to China. The State Department facilitated the transportation of these donated medical supplies to the Chinese people, including materials donated by Samaritan’s Purse, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Boeing, Intermountain Healthcare, and other private organizations. The delivery was intended to help save lives in China and contain the virus within the country.

The Facebook post claiming that the U.S. gave away medical supplies that are now needed at home is largely accurate. The State Department announced the delivery on February 7, and the timing coincided with a press conference in which the WHO warned of a potential supply shortage of PPE globally, including in China. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated that demand for PPE was up to 100 times higher than normal, and prices were up to 20 times higher. He emphasized that health workers and caretakers should be the first to receive items from the limited stock.

The Facebook post also claims that U.S. health care workers are dying due to a lack of PPE. While it is true that some health workers have been infected with COVID-19, the article does not provide specific evidence linking their infections to a lack of PPE. However, there have been reports of shortages, and health workers have been vocal about the need for more supplies, using the hashtag #GetMePPE on social media.

The article mentions that some medical supplies are now being imported into the U.S. from abroad, including a shipment arranged by the White House from China and the New England Patriots lending their team plane to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks from China for Massachusetts’ health workers.

It is unclear whether any of the donated materials sent to China in February made their way back to the U.S., and whether the donations would have gone directly to U.S. hospitals if they had not been shipped overseas. The State Department did not provide answers to these questions.

In summary, the claim that the U.S. sent 18 tons of medical supplies to China on February 7, the same day the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE, is accurate. The donated materials came from private organizations and were intended to help save lives in China and contain the virus. The article does not provide direct evidence linking the lack of PPE to the deaths of U.S. health care workers, but shortages have been reported, and health workers have expressed the need for more supplies.
Claim: “On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.”
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The State Department announced Feb. 7 that it had “facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies to the Chinese people.”   The same day, the WHO director general said, “There is limited stock of (personal protective equipment) and we need to make sure we get it to the people who need it most in the places that need it most,” citing health care workers and caretakers. A State Department spokesperson told us efforts aimed at responding to the threat of the coronavirus overseas also help mitigate the spread in the U.S.","“On February 7, the WHO warned about the limited stock of PPE. That same day, the Trump administration announced it was sending 18 tons of masks, gowns and respirators to China.”","A Facebook post claims the U.S. sent 18 tons of medical supplies to China on Feb. 7, the same day the World Health Organization warned of a limited stock of PPE. The post is largely accurate. The State Department announced the delivery on Feb. 7, and the timing coincided with a press conference in which the WHO warned of a potential supply shortage of PPE globally, including in China."
1046,"### Context: The claim that Christine Blasey Ford committed perjury by identifying herself as a ""research psychologist"" in her Senate committee testimony is not supported by evidence. The claim originated from an article on the website Dangerous.com, which suggested that Ford may have violated California law by misrepresenting herself as a psychologist. However, there is no evidence to support this claim.

Ford holds a doctorate in psychology from the University of Southern California and has two master's degrees in psychology. She is a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and also works as a research psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. While the website editor, Chadwick Moore, could not find Ford's name listed on a public database of licensed psychologists in California, this does not mean she violated any laws.

The California Business and Professions Code does protect the title of ""psychologist"" and prohibits falsely representing oneself as a psychologist without proper certification. However, there is an exemption for those who work at research institutions, allowing them to state their professional role as long as they specify it is specific to the facility where they are employed.

Moore also claimed that Ford's job title on the Stanford University School of Medicine website changed from ""research psychologist"" to ""affiliate"" after the Kavanaugh controversy. However, it is unclear whether this change was made in response to the controversy or for other reasons.

The article reached out to Ford's attorneys for clarification on her employment status and whether she holds any clinical licenses, but did not receive a response. However, it is important to note that perjury is defined as knowingly making false statements under oath, and Ford's use of a job title given to her by her employer does not meet this criterion.

In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the claim that Christine Blasey Ford committed perjury by identifying herself as a ""research psychologist"" in her Senate committee testimony. The California Business and Professions Code provides an exemption for those working at research institutions, allowing them to use their professional role as long as it is specific to their employment facility.

1047,"### Context: The claim that there have been public warnings about flesh-eating bacteria at Florida beaches on the Gulf of Mexico is true, but the bacteria is technically not classified as ""flesh-eating."" The bacteria in question is called Vibro vulnificus and it can infect people who eat raw shellfish or come into direct contact with seawater through open wounds. People with healthy immune systems usually experience mild symptoms, but those with underlying illnesses or compromised immune systems, especially those with liver disease, are at a higher risk. The bacteria can cause blood infections and blistering skin lesions, leading to the term ""flesh-eating bacteria."" In extreme cases, amputation may be necessary to stop the spread of infection. Public health warnings about the bacteria have been issued in previous years, with a combined 73 cases reported in 2013 and 2014. However, infections are rare considering the millions of visitors to Florida beaches each summer. Health experts have disputed the term ""flesh-eating bacteria,"" but necrotizing soft tissue infections, which the bacteria can cause, are informally referred to as such due to the destruction of body tissue. Overall, the claim is true, although there is debate over the terminology used to describe the bacteria.

1048,"### Context: The Trump administration has submitted a final rule on gas mileage and greenhouse gas emissions, but the details have not been released yet. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) believes that the rule, written jointly with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will improve gas mileage and reduce emissions from new vehicles in the US. The administration claims that the rule will make new vehicles more affordable and safer, putting more of them on the road. However, the details of the rule have not been disclosed until it is reviewed and published by the Office of Management and Budget.

Last year, the administration proposed a freeze on fuel efficiency standards, which sparked a legal battle with California. California has the authority to set its own greenhouse gas emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. Trump revoked California's authority, and the state challenged the decision in court. The auto industry also split on the matter, with four companies (Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, and Honda) siding with California, while most other automakers supported Trump.

When the Trump administration released its proposed ""Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule"" in 2018, it faced criticism from environmental groups who claimed that the calculations were flawed. Even the EPA's Science Advisory Board, which is mainly appointed by Trump, questioned the rationale in a draft report. The administration's preferred option was a freeze at 2020 levels, arguing that it would save lives by making vehicles more affordable and increasing sales. However, EPA staffers privately challenged this rationale, stating that the proposal would actually increase highway deaths.

Overall, the article suggests that the Trump administration is signaling a compromise on gas mileage rules, but the details of the final rule have not been disclosed yet. The administration believes that the rule will improve gas mileage, reduce emissions, and make new vehicles more affordable and safer. However, there has been criticism from environmental groups and even within the EPA regarding the rationale behind the proposed freeze on fuel efficiency standards. The article highlights the ongoing legal battle between the administration and California over greenhouse gas emissions standards.

1049,"### Context: The article discusses the presence of private medical practices in communist Cuba, where state healthcare is free and universal. Private medical practices have been banned in Cuba since 1963, but a few practitioners, like 80-year-old Dr. Barca, still operate. Many Cubans are frustrated with the inefficiency of the state healthcare system and believe that allowing more private practices would improve services and ease the burden on the state. Some patients, like Martha Garcia, have been visiting private practitioners for years because they feel they receive better care and have access to necessary equipment that is lacking in free health clinics. 

The article explains that Cuba initially allowed private medical practices after the 1959 revolution, but as the country moved towards socialism and nationalized the healthcare system, many doctors left the country. Currently, there are about 70,000 doctors in Cuba, many of whom serve on medical missions in other countries, which brings income to the government. However, only a handful of private practitioners remain due to the lack of new entrants in the field for over 50 years. President Raul Castro has allowed the privatization of various businesses, but professionals like doctors have not been given the same opportunity. 

The government has tried to raise awareness among Cubans about the value of its medical services by displaying posters at clinics that show the low costs of consultations, X-rays, MRIs, and surgeries. However, some Cubans still prefer paying for private treatment. Mayra Hernandez, a hotel worker, believes that being treated by Dr. Barca is worth the bus trip and fee he charges because she was unable to get the treatment she needed at public clinics. Dr. Barca, who works four days a week, plans to continue practicing until he dies because he enjoys his profession.

Overall, the article highlights the demand for private medical practices in Cuba due to frustrations with the state healthcare system. Many Cubans believe that allowing more private practices would improve the quality of healthcare services and alleviate the burden on the state. However, the government has not shown any signs of expanding the privatization of the medical field, which is considered strategic.

1050,"### Context: An article titled ""Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial"" discusses the results of a clinical trial for a new cholesterol drug called anacetrapib. The article emphasizes that the drug is still in the early stages of the clinical trial process and has a long way to go before it can be on the market. Therefore, it does not provide cost estimates.

The article mentions the potential economic impact of a cholesterol drug, considering that over 20 million Americans are currently taking statins. It highlights that on the day the trial results were announced, Merck stock went up, demonstrating the financial implications of this research.

The safety questions surrounding the drug are also emphasized in the article. It states that it is unknown whether the changes in cholesterol levels seen in the trial have beneficial health effects. The article quotes an independent source who expresses skepticism about the manipulation of HDL cholesterol levels, stating that they are not convinced it matters, although it shows promise.

The article reports that anacetrapib did not show harmful effects seen in trials of a similar drug, torcetrapib, which was pulled from testing. However, it clarifies that the trial was not powerful enough to rule out side effects that were less common than a certain threshold.

The article accurately reports that the trial primarily focused on safety, not health benefits. It mentions that the drug seemed to have passed an initial hurdle by proving safe in preliminary trials before discussing the changes in cholesterol levels.

The article does not engage in disease-mongering and accurately reports that the trial included patients with coronary heart disease and those considered to have a greater than 20 percent chance of a cardiovascular event within 10 years.

Although the article includes independent sources to provide context, it fails to mention that the trial was sponsored by the drug company developing anacetrapib and that the quoted researcher has financial ties to that and other drug companies.

The article briefly mentions the role of diet and exercise in cholesterol management but does not provide extensive information on how anacetrapib might fit into the context of other approaches.

Overall, the article acknowledges that anacetrapib is still years away from being considered for approval and that there are other drugs in a similar stage of testing. It does not appear to rely on a news release.
Claim: Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Beginning with the lead and continuing throughout, the story reminded readers of the limitations of this trial and that questions about health benefits will have to wait for the next round of experimentation. However, although this story gives readers a balanced view of what researchers reported, it should have told them that the trial was sponsored by a drug company and that the lead researcher has financial ties to that company and others in the field. When a trial is designed to test safety, stories about the results should focus on that question without wandering off into speculation about health benefits that have yet to be put to the test. That’s what this story does. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the “good” HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented. In reality it takes a lot of subjects to even begin to get a picture of the risks and benefits of a new drug. While encouraging, the results of this study are far from conclusive.",Experimental Drug Raises Good Cholesterol Levels in Early Trial,This is a story about a drug that is still in the early stages of clinical testing. The story does a good job of explaining that the drug is years away from possible approval. The story also does a good job of explaining that the drug may not provide the health benefits that researchers hope for. The story could have been improved by including information about the financial ties of the researcher who is quoted in the story. The story also could have been improved by including more information about the role of diet and exercise in managing cholesterol.
1051,"### Context: The article discusses the pollution and health concerns faced by residents living near the Houston Ship Channel, a waterway connecting plants to the ocean. Some residents claim that the air has a chemical-based smell and that the pollution is affecting their health, although scientific evidence does not prove this. One resident, Eugene Barragan, has found lumps in his lungs and experiences coughing fits. Lillian Riojas, Valero Energy Corp's chief spokeswoman, states that the company has worked to reduce pollution at its refinery since 1997, and data shows a decrease in ambient benzene levels. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality gives Valero's refinery the top compliance level, while other nearby refineries and chemical plants have a satisfactory compliance rating. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co has implemented changes to lower emissions, while LyondellBasell Industries, TPC Group, and Flint Hills Resources did not comment on pollution in the area. A 2007 study found that children living within 2 miles of the Houston Ship Channel had a higher risk of contracting acute lymphocytic leukemia, suggesting an association between childhood leukemia and air pollution. However, the study could not prove that pollutants caused the illnesses. Residents like Dennys Nieto, who recently moved away from the area, suffer from asthma, lung pain, headaches, inflammation, and erratic blood pressure and heartbeat. They believe that the pollution in the air is causing these health issues and want to move to a location far from the refineries to improve their health and quality of life.

1052,"### Context: The claim that the U.S. standard railroad gauge derives directly from the width of Imperial Roman war chariots is partly true, but for trivial and unremarkable reasons. The article explains that the gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches used in the U.S. railroads was adopted because it was the same gauge used in England, where the railroads were built by English expatriates. The English, in turn, used that gauge because it was the same as the wheel spacing of wagons, which was determined by the width of the wheel ruts on the old roads in England. These ruts were formed by Roman war chariots, and since the chariots were made for Imperial Rome, they all had the same wheel spacing. Therefore, the U.S. standard railroad gauge can be traced back to the width of Roman war chariots.

However, the article also points out that this claim is not completely accurate. The U.S. railroads were not solely built by English expatriates, and there were multiple gauges of track used in the Confederacy during the Civil War. The eventual standardization of railroad gauge in the U.S. was due to the North winning the war and rebuilding the Southern railway system to match its own.

The article also mentions an interesting extension to the story about railroad gauges. It explains that the width of the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) used in the Space Shuttle program was determined by the width of a tunnel through which they had to be transported by train. The tunnel was slightly wider than the railroad track, which was about the width of two horses' behinds. Therefore, the major design feature of the Space Shuttle was determined by the width of a horse's behind.

In conclusion, while the claim that the U.S. standard railroad gauge derives directly from the width of Imperial Roman war chariots is partly true, it is not completely accurate. The gauge was adopted because it was the same as the gauge used in England, which was determined by the width of wagon wheel spacing, which in turn was determined by the width of Roman war chariot wheel ruts. The article also highlights the connection between the width of the SRBs used in the Space Shuttle program and the width of a horse's behind.

1053,"### Context: An Arizona man has died and his wife has been hospitalized after ingesting a fish-tank cleaner containing chloroquine phosphate, the same active ingredient found in anti-malarial drugs that President Donald Trump has mentioned as a possible treatment for COVID-19. The couple mistakenly believed that the fish-tank cleaner was the same as the drug form of chloroquine mentioned by Trump. Chloroquine phosphate is used in prescription-only anti-malarial drugs in the U.S., while the fish-tank cleaner is not suitable for human consumption.

The confusion surrounding the couple's case is not unique, as some headlines failed to make it clear that they ingested fish-tank cleaner rather than the prescription drug. One headline even suggested that the fish-tank additive could treat coronavirus, which is incorrect. Officials from the hospital that treated the couple warned against self-medicating and emphasized that their case should serve as a cautionary tale.

The woman explained that she had seen Trump talk about chloroquine as a potential coronavirus cure in a press conference, and she had the fish-tank cleaner stored in her house. She mixed the cleaner with soda and drank it as a preventative measure. Trump has praised chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19, but experts have stated that there is only anecdotal evidence of their effectiveness. Clinical trials are currently being conducted to study these drugs.

The fish-tank cleaner containing chloroquine phosphate is not approved for human consumption and should not be used as a substitute for the prescription drug. The FDA has warned against using products that claim to prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 without proper evaluation and approval. The agency emphasized that chloroquine should only be taken if prescribed and obtained from legitimate sources.

While there have been studies suggesting that the prescription drug form of chloroquine may have benefits in treating COVID-19, more research is needed. The fish-tank cleaner, however, is not safe for human use.

1055,"### Context: The article examines the claim made by Wendy Davis, a Democratic gubernatorial nominee, that women in Texas are paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns. The article finds that while pay gaps do exist between men and women in Texas, the comparisons can be complicated.

In 2010, the general pay gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women was $8,355, according to federal estimates. However, this does not necessarily mean that women are paid less for doing the same job as men. A 2013 survey indicated a $2,000 gap between the median pay for Texas men and women with comparable professional experiences holding the same or similar jobs.

Davis' claim of women being paid 82 cents for every dollar earned by men is supported by a fact sheet from the National Partnership for Women & Families, which cites a one-year American Community Survey undertaken in 2011 by the U.S Census Bureau. The latest available estimate from the 2012 survey is that Texas women working full time earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men.

Experts note that the pay gap cannot be fully accounted for by job differences and suggest that sexism plays a role. Factors such as educational attainment, work experience, and industry category contribute to the pay gap. Women are more likely to be employed part-time, and men are more likely to work longer hours, including overtime, which leads to higher earnings.

The article also compares Texas women's pay to women in other states and the national average. In 2012, Texas women fared better compared to men in their state than women in 24 other states. However, when looking at all employed individuals, women in Texas earn 71 cents for every dollar earned by men.

Overall, the article concludes that while Davis' claim is accurate based on the 2011 survey, the latest available estimate from 2012 shows that Texas women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men.
Claim: Women ""are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Davis said that Texas women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in the state. Her figure, based on a 2011 federal survey, reflects median earnings for adults who worked full time in the past 12 months, leaving out part-time workers. It’s also outdated in that according to the latest available survey, taken in 2012, Texas women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men (again working full time in the past 12 months), less than what Davis said.","Women ""are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas.","Davis said that women """"are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas.""""

1056,"### Context: The article discusses the issue of obesity among children in China, focusing on the case of Lu Zhihao, a 4-year-old boy who weighs over 60 kg (132.3 lb), which is five times the weight of an average boy his age. Lu Zhihao's condition is suspected to be partly due to a hormone imbalance. The article highlights the growing problem of obesity in Chinese society, particularly among the more affluent middle-class families who are raising pampered children like Lu Zhihao.

The authors of the book ""Fat China: How expanding waistlines are Changing a Nation"" attribute the rise in obesity to factors such as rising incomes, greater longevity, and the one-child policy. The one-child policy has resulted in each child having richer parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles who are keen to spoil them, leading to the ""Little Emperor"" syndrome. The article also mentions the influence of Western fast-food chains like McDonald's and KFC, which are now present in many Chinese towns and cities.

Lu Zhihao's mother admits that he throws tantrums when denied food, and his father expresses concern about his health, stating that his legs cannot support his weight and his heart is under pressure due to the heavy load. The article also cites a 2008 Chinese National Task Force on Childhood Obesity, which found that almost one in five children under seven in China are overweight, and more than seven percent are obese.

Overall, the article highlights the issue of obesity among children in China, particularly among the more affluent middle-class families.

1057,"### Context: The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has authorized the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) to use Medicaid funds to pay for short-term care for patients admitted at large institutions for mental disease. This expands the treatment options for individuals with substance use disorder and serious mental illness in Indiana. The state sought to extend the expanded substance abuse and mental illness components of the Healthy Indiana Plan through 2025.

The Medicaid waiver, which took effect on Wednesday, allows Indiana to offer the full continuum of treatment for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. The FSSA Secretary, Dr. Jennifer Sullivan, stated that this waiver will ensure consistency in treatment for the one in four people with mental illness who also have a substance abuse problem.

State records show that only about half of Indiana Medicaid members receiving inpatient psychiatric services between July 2018 and June 2019 obtained them at an institution for mental diseases. The new waiver is expected to allow for longer inpatient stays, improved stabilization, and more successful transitions back into homes and communities. It also aims to reduce costs associated with overuse of hospital emergency rooms for mental health problems and psychiatric crises.

Republican Governor Eric Holcomb expressed his support for the waiver, stating that it aligns with his agenda to improve the lives of Hoosiers and increase the capacity of mental health services throughout the state. He believes that this waiver will help achieve these goals from the beginning of the new year.

In summary, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has authorized Indiana to use Medicaid funds for short-term care at large mental health facilities. This expansion aims to provide consistent treatment for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, improve stabilization, and reduce costs associated with emergency room visits. Governor Holcomb sees this as a step towards improving mental health services in the state.

1059,"### Context: The claim that ""almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood) pregnancy services were abortions"" is misleading. The statement refers to a fact sheet by the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates. The fact sheet breaks down ""pregnancy services"" into three categories: abortions, prenatal care, and adoption referrals. According to Planned Parenthood's annual report, abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories. However, this analysis is misleading for several reasons.

Firstly, not all of Planned Parenthood's clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not their focus. Many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care, but the number of referrals is not recorded. If referrals were included, the percentage of abortions would likely change, but it is impossible to determine by how much.

Secondly, Planned Parenthood does not specifically track the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for reasons other than prenatal care, abortion, or adoption. Many of their services are not related to pregnancy at all, such as testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, contraception, and cancer screening.

According to Planned Parenthood's report, abortions account for only 3 percent of all services performed. However, if the share of abortions is calculated per patient (assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to 12 percent. Critics argue that this measurement of ""services"" is flawed because performing an abortion is more involved than administering a pregnancy test or providing contraception.

In conclusion, the claim that almost 95 percent of Planned Parenthood's pregnancy services were abortions is based on a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of their services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. Planned Parenthood does not fully track the number of pregnancy referrals, making it impossible to determine an accurate percentage of ""pregnancy services"" that were abortions.
Claim: Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood) pregnancy services were abortions.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Smith said, ""Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions."" An anti-abortion group puts the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes ""pregnancy services"" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant. But Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information. What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals. Planned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers.

1060,"### Context: The article discusses U.S. Rep. David Scott's claim that an average of 5,600 soldiers commit suicide each year, which is about 20 per day. The article points out that there is a miscalculation in Scott's statement, as the correct number would be 15 daily suicides. However, the article acknowledges that Scott's point about the high number of veteran suicides is still valid. 

The article mentions that Scott's concern about mental health treatment for veterans was sparked by an investigation by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) in 2010. The investigation found that over 500 veterans were on a waiting list for mental health care at the Atlanta VA Medical Center, and 16 attempted suicide. The VA tried to address the issue by referring veterans to outside treatment, but this led to long waiting lists at those clinics. Federal audits later linked the deaths of three veterans in Atlanta to poor oversight by hospital staff, and it was revealed that a fourth veteran committed suicide in a VA hospital bathroom.

The article also discusses a VA study on suicide data, which estimates that 22 veterans die by suicide each day. However, the study includes all veterans, not just those who are on active or reserve services. The study also found that the majority of veteran suicides were by those age 50 and older. The article concludes that while Scott's math may be slightly off, his point about the high number of veteran suicides is still valid. However, the article notes that there is no evidence to support the implication that the VA is to blame for these deaths. 

Scott supports a proposal to offer employment incentives to psychiatrists who work for the VA to address the shortage of mental health services. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) has also lobbied for a bill that calls for recruiting more healthcare workers to the VA and Department of Defense and reviewing their suicide prevention programs. The article emphasizes the need for change in the system to prevent veteran suicides.

1061,"### Context: The article discusses a conspiracy theory surrounding the injuries of Democratic Senator Harry Reid. Reid's staff claimed that he broke bones in his face and ribs when a piece of exercise equipment malfunctioned and caused him to collide with some cabinets on New Year's Eve. However, conspiracy theories emerged when Reid announced that he would not seek re-election after the accident. The theory that gained traction was that Reid actually sustained his injuries in a fight with his brother, Larry Reid.

The theory was popularized by the blog site Power Line, which presented the case for it in a series of posts. The blog cited an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor named Easton Elliott, who claimed that Larry Reid showed up at a meeting on New Year's Eve drunk and covered in blood, recounting a fight with a family member. Elliott connected this account with news stories about Harry Reid being admitted to the hospital on New Year's Day and concluded that the family member involved in the fight was Harry Reid.

However, there is no concrete evidence to support the theory that Harry and Larry Reid got into a fistfight on New Year's Eve. The only source for this claim is Easton Elliott, whose existence is questionable. The blog post mentioned that the name ""Easton Elliott"" was possibly fabricated by a Las Vegas businessman for his second career as an addiction recovery life coach. The only online presence of Easton Elliott is a LinkedIn profile with no connections.

The article also mentions that Larry Reid was indeed arrested for drunken driving and assaulting a state patrol officer in February 2015. However, this does not prove that he was involved in a fight with Harry Reid on New Year's Eve.

In conclusion, despite the conspiracy theories surrounding Harry Reid's injuries, there is currently no evidence to suggest that they resulted from anything other than a workout accident. The claims made by Easton Elliott are unverified, and the blog site Power Line did not endorse them.

1062,"### Context: The article discusses a pre-clinical study that examined the effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles and curcumin in cell culture. The study found that the formulation of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles resulted in substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. The researchers also noted that nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma. However, the news release does not provide any data to support these claims and uses sweeping phrases instead of quantitative estimates.

The news release does not mention any potential harms or toxic effects of nanotechnology on the body, which is a concern for some scientists. Nanoparticles may have toxic effects on the lungs and other organs, and may affect the endocrine system, leading to changes in hormone levels, sexual characteristics, reproduction, and development. The news release only focuses on the benefits of nanoscience research without discussing potential harms.

The news release does not emphasize that the research is in its early pre-clinical stages and will take at least another 10 to 12 years before it is tested in humans. Testing treatments in cell culture is the first step, and what works in animal models often does not work in humans. The news release does not specify the type of cell lines used in the study, whether they were derived from humans or mice.

The news release does not discuss any existing alternatives to treat neuroblastoma, such as chemotherapy or surgery. It also initially gives the impression that the technology is available at local hospitals, but later clarifies that the study was conducted in cell lines in a laboratory.

The news release claims that the use of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles to treat neuroblastoma is novel, but previous studies have already looked at the use of curcumin-containing nanoparticles to induce cell death in neuroblastoma cells and the toxicity of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles.

Overall, the news release does not provide sufficient data or information to support its claims and does not address potential harms or existing alternatives. It also does not accurately represent the novelty of the research.
Claim: Nanoparticles loaded with component of common spice kill cancer cells
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This University of Central Florida news release covers a study published in the journal Nanoscale, which found that curcumin-loaded nanoparticles kill neuroblastoma tumor cells in cell culture (in test tubes or petri dishes). Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice tumeric. The news release doesn’t disclose any harms and quantitative data to back up its claims and, instead, uses only broad, ambiguous language when describing the treatment’s benefits. For example, researchers found that these molecules may induce “substantial” cell death in neuroblastoma cells without being toxic to healthy cells. The study’s limitations should have been emphasized — namely, that it’s early pre-clinical research with experiments only conducted in undefined cell lines. In addition, research with curcumin-loaded nanoparticles isn’t exactly new. In 2012, a couple of studies looked at the molecule’s effects, including its toxicity, on neuroblastoma cells. Many news releases cover research that is in its pre-clinical phases. This is fair game, of course, but we then expect these reports to caution readers on the treatment’s applicability to clinical medicine. In other words, treatments that are successful in cell lines and animal models usually do not translate to effective clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it also takes years, maybe decades, before a treatment is even ready for clinical trials — a process often referred to as “from bench to bedside.” To avoid giving patients false hope, news releases need to disclose the early nature of the research high up in the release as well as be more explicit in detailing the treatment’s development and timeline.",Nanoparticles loaded with component of common spice kill cancer cells,"This news release describes a pre-clinical study that examined the effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles and curcumin in cell culture.

1063,"### Context: The article discusses a study on the effectiveness of adalimumab (brand name Humira) as a treatment for chronic uveitis, a type of eye inflammation. The study found that adalimumab, when added to the standard treatment, improved the symptoms of uveitis and extended the time between flare-ups from 13 weeks to 24 weeks. However, the article highlights some important information that was not mentioned in the study's release. It states that patients in the adalimumab group reported more serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, compared to the placebo group. Additionally, 16% of patients in the adalimumab group dropped out of the study, compared to less than 7% in the placebo group. The article also notes that adalimumab had three times the rate of adverse events and twice as many serious adverse events compared to the placebo. The release of the study did not mention the word ""blindness,"" which is a possible outcome of untreated uveitis. The article praises the release for its transparency in disclosing potential conflicts of interest and directing readers to supplementary documents for more information. However, it criticizes the release for not providing enough information on how adalimumab compares to corticosteroids, which are commonly used to treat uveitis. The article explains that corticosteroids suppress the body's entire immune system, while adalimumab targets specific inflammation. The article concludes by stating that there is no cause for alarm in the study's findings.
Claim: Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.","Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","This news release describes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the drug adalimumab (Humira) for the treatment of chronic uveitis, a condition in which the eye’s iris and/or its surrounding tissue becomes inflamed. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that adding adalimumab to the standard treatment of corticosteroid eye drops reduced the frequency of flare-ups from 13 weeks to 24 weeks. The release does a good job of explaining the study’s findings, but it could have been more clear about the drug’s potential harms and its cost. Uveitis is a condition in which the eye’s iris and/or its surrounding tissue becomes inflamed. It can lead to vision loss and even blindness. The standard treatment for chronic uveitis is the use of corticosteroid eye drops. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including glaucoma and cataracts. The addition of adalimumab to the standard treatment may reduce the frequency of flare-ups and the need for corticosteroid eye drops."
1064,"### Context: Johnson was due to speak to manufacturers on Monday and the government had already asked engineers to find ways to quickly produce more ventilators in Britain which the government would buy, the prime minister’s office said. Germany and Italy have scrambled to get more ventilators and manufacturers warned on Friday that hospitals everywhere faced a lack of vital equipment needed to treat coronavirus patients. The government was also negotiating with private healthcare providers about paying for thousands of beds in private hospitals, to be brought into use if coronavirus spreads rapidly in Britain. “The public are right to be proud of the NHS, but the scale of the challenge we face means we can’t do this alone,” the head of Britain’s National Health Service, Simon Stevens, said in a statement issued by Downing Street. All hospitals would be given instructions on Monday to help them to prepare, he said. Britain has so far had fewer confirmed cases of coronavirus than other countries in Europe such as Italy, Spain and France but the death toll almost doubled to 21 on Saturday. A British government source said the government would ban mass gatherings from next week in an attempt to curb the coronavirus outbreak, an escalation of its crisis plan that critics have said was too relaxed.

1065,"### Context: The article discusses a chain letter-style post that has been circulating on Facebook, containing medical advice about the symptoms and treatments for the novel coronavirus strain known as COVID-19. The post, which has been shared over 291,000 times since February 27, 2020, presents itself as an ""important announcement"" and includes a list of claims.

Dr. Christopher Labos, a cardiologist and associate with the office for science and society at McGill University, identified four outright falsehoods in the post. One of the claims is that drinking warm water can treat the virus, but there is no evidence to support this. While increasing water intake is generally considered beneficial for health, it is not a proven deterrent or treatment for COVID-19.

The article also mentions that both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other health experts have advised frequent handwashing with soap and water or the use of hand sanitizer. However, it is unclear how long the virus can survive on hands.

The symptoms associated with COVID-19 can vary, and the alleged timeline for the virus' progression mentioned in the post is unclear. Some patients did not report any symptoms before being diagnosed with the virus. The CDC has reported that in some cases involving children in China, patients listed a runny nose as a symptom alongside coughing and running a fever.

The article states that while it may be possible to contract the virus by touching an affected surface and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, it is believed that the primary mode of transmission is through human contact.

The author attempted to contact other public health institutions, such as the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, for more information. However, they were only granting requests for comment to ""top-tier"" news outlets.

In summary, the article highlights the spread of a chain letter-style post on Facebook containing medical advice about COVID-19. The post includes both false and true claims, and there are still unknowns about the symptoms and transmission of the virus.

1067,"### Context: The article discusses the controversy surrounding a photoshoot in which Roseanne Barr, the star of the sitcom Roseanne, dressed up as Hitler and posed with gingerbread cookies. The photos were originally part of a 2009 article in Heeb magazine, a satirical Jewish publication. The article explains that Roseanne asked to dress up as Hitler for the spread, jokingly claiming that she may be the reincarnation of the Führer. The author of the article describes Roseanne's personality and her current projects, highlighting her unconventional and outspoken nature.

The photoshoot received considerable backlash and criticism from pundits across the political spectrum. The View and The O'Reilly Factor featured segments criticizing Roseanne for the Hitler-themed photoshoot. However, Heeb magazine defended the pictures, stating that their goal was to challenge preconceptions and represent the complex perspectives that many Jews have about their identities. The magazine argued that Holocaust jokes are frequently featured in Hollywood movies and that they were trying to communicate something truthful about contemporary Jewishness.

Roseanne herself addressed the issue during an episode of The Green Room with Paul Provenza. She explained that the photoshoot was for Heeb magazine's Germany issue and that Hitler was a symbol of Germany. She expressed frustration with the backlash, stating that she was not making fun of people in the ovens but trying to convey a deeper message about the everyday nature of holocausts.

In summary, the article discusses the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr's photoshoot as Hitler for Heeb magazine. It provides context about the satirical nature of the publication and the intention behind the photoshoot.

1068,"### Context: The claim that there has been a surge in people using bug spray to get high is not supported by evidence. The Daily Mail reported on three incidents, but only one involved a confirmed case of someone intentionally using insecticide as a recreational drug. The other two incidents were based on speculation and hearsay. In one incident, a person in Mississippi combined methamphetamine with crystals produced from spraying Raid insecticide on an electrified screen and injected it. However, this was an isolated case and not part of a trend. The second incident allegedly involved a man in Tennessee who was high on a mix of wasp spray and methamphetamine. Some reports suggested that the perpetrator admitted to intentionally using this combination, but more detailed reporting indicated that this was just an assumption based on drug trends. There was no confirmation that wasp spray was found in the perpetrator's system. The final incident, which occurred in Indianapolis, involved a series of overdoses at a men's shelter. The cause of the overdose was determined to be synthetic marijuana mixed with an unknown chemical, not bug spray. The claim that bug spray is being used to get high is based on vague language and speculation. The effects of using bug spray as a recreational drug are also questionable. While pyrethroids, the compounds found in bug spray, can cause problems in humans at high concentrations, most people tolerate large amounts without complications. Medical literature includes cases of people consuming or injecting large volumes of pyrethroids without experiencing violent or psychotic behavior. The symptoms described in the incidents mentioned in the article can be attributed to synthetic marijuana and similar chemicals, not bug spray. Therefore, the claim that there has been a surge in people using bug spray to get high is not supported by evidence.
Claim: Health officials have seen a surge in the number of people using ""bug spray"" to get high.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"There are two cases, though only one has been confirmed, in which a crystallized form of bug spray is alleged to have been added to methamphetamine, and these events resulted in symptoms consistent with an aggressive methamphetamine high. The final case, in contrast, involved the unconfirmed assertion that bug spray, in liquid form, was sprayed to synthetic marijuana (to enhance the high or perhaps throw drug dogs off the scent) and resulted in symptoms consistent with a synthetic marijuana overdose. The collection of these three events does not coherently create a narrative that can be considered an “alarming trend,” but because at least one credible report documents a case in which someone intentionally injected Raid (mixed with methamphetamine), we rank the assertion of a surge in the number of people using “bug spray” to get high as mostly false.","Health officials have seen a surge in the number of people using ""bug spray"" to get high.","What's undeniable is that the three incidents described above are not evidence of a """"surge"""" in bug spray abuse, but rather isolated incidents that may or may not have anything to do with each other."
1069,"### Context: The article discusses the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845. It states that after years of debate, the various political factions in the US agreed that the benefits of annexing Texas outweighed the pitfalls. The article mentions that Texas was a struggling frontier community with a colonial economy and lacked basic requirements for statehood. The presence of Texas as an independent republic posed a threat to US ambitions and interests, and it blocked American expansion to the Pacific. The primary stumbling block to annexation was the potential for war with Mexico, which eventually happened in the Mexican-American War in 1846.

The article also highlights the contentious issue of slavery in relation to the annexation of Texas. The admission of Texas as a slave state would upset the balance between free and slave states in the US. Some southerners wanted to carve additional slave states out of the vast Texas territory to maintain the balance of power in the Senate. The slavery issue was addressed in the Joint Resolution for Annexing Texas, which allowed for Texas to be divided into up to four more states. Slavery would be banned in states formed north of the Missouri Compromise line and left up to popular sovereignty in states formed south of the line.

Texas was officially admitted to the Union in 1845, and the possibility of splitting Texas into more than one state was avoided in 1850 when California was admitted as a free state and Texas received $10 million to relinquish its territorial claims. The Compromise of 1850 settled these issues temporarily. The article mentions that the issue of the slavery demarcation line became moot with the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and the Supreme Court's ruling in the Dred Scott decision.

The article concludes by stating that the provision in the Texas Annexation document allowing for the creation of four additional states was largely superfluous. The US Constitution already provided for the formation of new states through the junction or division of existing states.

In summary, the article discusses the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845 and the contentious issues surrounding it, including the threat of war with Mexico and the issue of slavery. It also mentions the provision in the annexation document allowing for Texas to be divided into five different states.

He was taken to the hospital but died three days later. Initially, the police believed it was a traffic accident, but later stated that three men, including the pedicab driver who found Siregar, were suspects in stealing his belongings. Walhi stated that Siregar had head injuries from a blunt object, but no wounds on other parts of his body. His bag, laptop, wallet, and phone were missing. Amnesty International Indonesia called for an independent investigation, as Siregar had raised cases on environmental and human rights crimes against local people. Human rights lawyer Muhamad Isnur questioned why Siregar's motorbike was not stolen if his death resulted from a robbery. The police did not respond to requests for comment. Siregar had been involved in various projects, including assisting fishermen in a lawsuit against a sand miner and fighting against forest encroachment. His most high-profile case was representing Walhi in a legal challenge to stop the construction of a $1.5 billion China-funded hydro dam, which experts warned would harm orangutan habitats. The company that owns the dam project, North Sumatra Hydro Energy (NSHE), denied any involvement in Siregar's death and requested not to be connected to it until the police investigation is completed.

1072,"### Context: French drugmaker Sanofi has announced that it will be ending its research in diabetes and narrowing its business units in order to boost profitability. The decision comes as the company aims to revitalize itself after disappointing investors in recent years. Sanofi's move away from diabetes research marks a significant turning point for the company, which had previously dominated the insulin market but faced challenges due to patent losses and declining sales. The company's new CEO, Paul Hudson, stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve breakthrough innovation and that resources need to be redirected to areas of opportunity. 

While Sanofi is discontinuing its diabetes research, it is focusing on other areas such as cancer drugs. The company recently announced a deal to acquire U.S. biotechnology firm Synthorx for approximately $2.5 billion. Sanofi also plans to achieve new cost savings of €2 billion ($2.20 billion) by 2022 through spending cuts and supply chain restructuring. It aims to increase its core operating margin to 30% by 2022, up from 25.8% in the previous year.

Sanofi highlighted the potential of its eczema treatment Dupixent, which has recently been approved for other therapeutic areas such as asthma. The company aims to expand sales of Dupixent to over €10 billion. In 2018, revenue for the drug increased by 268% to reach €788 million. Sanofi plans to reorganize its business units around three pillars: specialty care (including oncology and rare diseases), vaccines, and general medicines. Its consumer healthcare unit, which includes over-the-counter products like Doliprane, Cialis, and Tamiflu, will be considered as a standalone business.

Sanofi's objective for the consumer healthcare business is to unlock value and entrepreneurial energy by growing faster than the market in the mid-term. The company is considering options such as a joint venture or an outright sale for the division. Sanofi will provide further details about its strategic plans to investors on Tuesday.

Overall, Sanofi's decision to end diabetes research and narrow its business units is aimed at improving profitability and focusing on areas of opportunity, such as cancer drugs and specialty care. The company also plans to achieve cost savings and increase its core operating margin.

He was referring to a decision made by the Health and Human Services Department Secretary Kathleen Sebelius regarding preventive services that must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance, or deductible. The rule requires most health insurance plans to cover FDA-approved forms of contraception without any additional costs. However, there is an exemption for certain non-profit religious employers, such as churches and synagogues, but it does not cover religious organizations that do not primarily employ or serve people of the same religion. This means that many universities, hospitals, and charitable groups would not be exempt from providing insurance coverage that includes contraceptive drugs, some of which are considered abortion-inducing by Catholics. The government is giving these religious groups an extra year to implement the preventive care requirements, but they are not exempt from the rule. The decision is already facing legal challenges. Gingrich's claim is not entirely accurate because the rule does not apply to all Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant institutions, and there is an exemption for certain religious employers.

The story mentioned that the study found no serious side effects in six months. It also gave the caveat that the study did not address the issue of longer-term safety. This article reported on the results of a randomized clinical trial; details on its publication were included as well as potential conflicts of interest of the study’s authors. Other information sources were also mentioned in the piece. No obvious disease-mongering. Yet, although an estimate of prevalence was given, natural history of knee OA was not mentioned.

And while the study failed to demonstrate benefit in management of knee OA, the article included a quote from a patient who uses the supplements and believes they are effective (though whether the individual has knee OA is not clear). Thus the story seems to balance one individual anecdote against the weight of evidence from a study of 1,583 people.

Davenport commented on the unfortunate choice of badge number without initially explaining its significance. However, it is revealed that the number ""1488"" or ""14/88"" is included in the Anti-Defamation League's Hate Symbols Database as a white supremacist code. The number ""14"" represents the slogan ""We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children,"" while ""88"" stands for ""Heil Hitler."" Together, these numbers endorse white supremacy and are commonly used within the white supremacist movement.

The article also mentions previous instances where the numbers ""1488"" or ""14/88"" have been used. For example, a Trump store commemorative baseball was priced at $88, and a Department of Health and Human Services admission mentioned ""1,488"" lost children. Additionally, a Department of Homeland Security memo had a fourteen-word title that resembled the neo-Nazi ""Fourteen Words"" trope.

1076,"### Context: Farmers have been feeding their cattle candy, including Skittles, for several years. This practice became more popular in 2012 when farmers faced a corn shortage and the rising price of corn. Feeding candy to cows is a thrifty and resourceful way for farmers to provide alternative feed options. The candy is blended with more traditional forms of feed, such as hay, and is given to cows in small amounts, usually capped at 3% of their diet. Farmers have found that the sugar in ice cream sprinkles, for example, can increase milk production by three pounds per cow per day. 

According to John Waller, a professor of animal nutrition at the University of Tennessee, using waste candy as cow feed is a viable option that prevents the material from going to landfills. Ruminant animals, like cows, have the ability to digest a wide variety of feedstuffs, thanks to the microbes in their rumen. This allows them to utilize byproducts of the local food industry that other animals cannot consume. Farmers across the country have been using different types of waste, such as orange rinds in Florida or almond hulls in California, to supplement their cattle's diet.

While it may be surprising to some, the practice of feeding candy to cows is not new. In fact, in January 2017, a truck carrying Skittles spilled its load on a Wisconsin road, revealing that the intended destination for the candy was a cattle farm. The Skittles were considered unfit for packaging and were meant to be used as feed for the cows. However, it is important to note that cows are not fed troughs filled solely with Skittles. The candy is mixed with other materials to create a balanced animal feed.

Overall, feeding candy to cows is a cost-effective way for farmers to provide alternative feed options, especially when faced with a shortage or high prices of corn. It allows them to utilize waste materials that would otherwise go to landfills and provides additional nutrients to the cattle.

1077,"### Context: The claim that monarch butterflies are becoming extinct due to the increased use of genetically modified crops is partially accurate but leaves out important details. While it is true that the monarch population is on the decline, experts say that the adoption of genetically modified crops is not the sole factor. The monarch population has dropped 90 percent over the past 20 years, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. The World Wildlife Fund classifies them as ""near threatened,"" which means they are ""likely to become endangered in the near future,"" but they are not currently classified as extinct.

Several factors contribute to the decline of monarch butterflies. Deforestation in Mexico, recent weather patterns, and reduced availability of milkweed, the butterflies' main food source, are all contributing factors. Illegal logging in Mexico has reduced the areas where monarchs can migrate, affecting their lifecycle. However, the Mexican government has made efforts to curtail this problem in the past five years. Weather patterns, such as a serious drought in Texas and an extra-long winter in 2014, have also impacted the monarchs' migration and survival.

The biggest threat to monarch butterflies is the reduced prevalence of milkweed, which is their primary food source and where their larvae grow. The increasing use of genetically modified crops that can withstand herbicides has led to a decline in milkweed. Milkweed cannot withstand herbicides like the GMO crops can, and farmers often remove it because it can stifle crop yield. A study in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity found a strong correlation between the increased use of herbicide-tolerant crops, the decline in milkweed prevalence, and the declining monarch population.

However, it is important to note that causation has not been definitively established, and other factors such as deforestation and weather events also play a role in the decline of monarch butterflies. Some argue that the blame placed on GMOs may be overstated, as correlation does not necessarily mean causation. While the evidence suggests a connection between GMO crops and the decline of monarch butterflies, further research is needed to establish a direct cause.

In conclusion, while the claim that monarch butterflies are becoming extinct due to the increased use of genetically modified crops is partially accurate, it leaves out important details. The decline of monarch butterflies is influenced by multiple factors, including deforestation, weather patterns, and the reduced availability of milkweed. While GMO crops have been correlated with the decline, causation has not been definitively established. Monarch butterflies are currently classified as ""near threatened"" and are several steps away from extinction.

The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"DeFazio said that ""monarch butterflies are becoming extinct"" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides. The evidence of a connection is suggestive but not conclusive. Monarch populations have been declining alongside a shrinkage in its primary food source -- milkweed -- and the increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides and herbicides. However, causation has not been established yet, and other culprits -- deforestation and unexpected weather events -- are likely to have played a role as well. Moreover, DeFazio exaggerated when he said that the butterfly species is ""becoming extinct."" It faces significant challenges, but monarchs remain several steps away from extinction, and many conservationists think the trend can be mitigated. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.","Monarch butterflies are becoming extinct"" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides.","What's true: The monarch butterfly population has declined by 90 percent over the past 20 years, and the increased use of genetically modified crops that can withstand herbicides has been correlated with the decline of milkweed, the monarchs' primary food source.

1078,"### Context: The article discusses a recent study on a breath test that could potentially be used for the early diagnosis of lung cancer. The release mentions that the cost of materials for the test is around $20, which is significantly less than the cost of CT scan imaging currently being used. However, it does not provide information on how much patients would be charged for the test. The release highlights the potential benefits of the breath test, such as lower cost and reduced exposure to repeat CT scans, but does not provide any quantification. It mentions that there was a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery, with three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalizing after surgery, matching levels of the control group. However, it does not define what a ""significant decrease"" means or what a ""normalized"" level would be. The release does not provide any information on the test's ability to accurately detect or rule out lung cancer recurrence, which would be important for its clinical use. It also does not address the potential harms of the test itself, such as false positive screens causing anxiety and necessitating additional testing. The release points out that the test could potentially reduce harms by reducing a patient's repeat exposure to radiation from CT scans. The release mentions that the breath test is being evaluated as a tool to monitor for disease recurrence, but it is not yet available and requires approval from the FDA. The release does not make a strong claim of novelty, but it could have mentioned related work that has been done in the field of breath analysis for lung cancer detection. Overall, the release does not provide enough information on the cost to patients, the test's accuracy, potential harms, and the hurdles that remain before the test can be validated for clinical use.
Claim: Lung Cancer Breath ‘Signature’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Image courtesy University of LouisvilleThis release discusses a study testing the efficacy of a test using the breath of lung cancer patients. Since patients with lung cancer are known to have specific chemicals in their breath — known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — which are caused by the disease, detecting them after the patients underwent surgery could indicate a recurrence of the disease. These chemicals are, in effect, markers for the presence of disease. The release notes the study showed a reduction in the amount of these compounds after patients had undergone surgical resection of the lung, but doesn’t give any numerical information about the level of reduction, other than to say it is “significant.” The release provides a nice description of costs and describes the test’s potential benefit to reduce harm from repeat CTs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States with 224,000 new diagnoses each year and 158,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Both early detection and successful monitoring of disease recurrence might reduce those numbers considerably. Current monitoring for lung cancer recurrence after surgery is based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. A breath test using chemical markers to detect recurrence could potentially be cheaper, simpler and less risky than repeat CT scans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a positive breath test would still necessitate a follow-up CT scan and with almost every screening test, there is a risk of missed diagnosis.",Lung Cancer Breath ‘Signature’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis,"This news release describes a small study of a breath test for lung cancer that is under development. The test is based on the idea that lung cancer produces a “signature” of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of patients with the disease.

1079,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by fluoride opponents regarding the cavity rate in Multnomah County, Oregon. The claim stated that Multnomah County has the 15th lowest cavity rate in the country, but PolitiFact Oregon ruled the statement false because county data is not comparable to state data. Additionally, the claim relied on cavity numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that were from varying years and cannot be ranked.

The article then mentions a draft report from the Oregon Health Authority that stated Oregon scored worse in every major measure of oral health for children in 2007 compared to 2002. The report also mentioned that Oregon ranked 25th, or 7th from the bottom, in the percentage of children with untreated decay compared to 32 other states with similar data. However, the CDC spokeswoman stated that the statistics are not meant to be ranked because they cover different time periods and have different response rates and percentages of children who qualify for free and reduced-price meals.

The article criticizes the Oregon Health Authority for using rankings based on percentages from other states and other years to provide context for Oregon's numbers. It argues that declaring Oregon as 25th based on these rankings does not provide meaningful or accurate context. The article also mentions that the Smile Survey released by the Oregon Health Authority showed a decrease in the percentage of children with untreated tooth decay from 36% in 2007 to 20% in 2011-12.

The article concludes by stating that the Oregon Health Authority should have presented the percentages for all 32 states in its 2007 report without designating a ranking. It also criticizes the inclusion of the phrase ""Oregon ranked 25th – or 7th from the bottom"" in the 2012 report, arguing that it was not the most responsible way to put perspective on Oregon's untreated decay percentages.

Overall, the article highlights the issues with comparing cavity rates between counties and states and criticizes the use of rankings based on different years and data to provide context for Oregon's cavity rate.

1080,"### Context: Researchers from Britain's Wellcome Sanger Institute and France's Institut Pasteur have used genomic sequencing techniques to trace the origins of the cholera outbreak in Yemen. The study found that the strain causing the epidemic in Yemen is related to one first seen in 2012 in South Asia, which has since spread globally. However, the Yemeni strain did not arrive directly from South Asia, but was circulating and causing outbreaks in eastern Africa in 2013-14 before appearing in Yemen in 2016. The researchers were not able to pinpoint exactly which countries in eastern Africa the strain had come from. 

The findings of this study are significant because they provide insights into the movement of cholera globally, which can help in better preparing for future outbreaks. By understanding how cholera moves, health authorities can intervene earlier and prevent the spread of the disease. This is particularly important in regions like Yemen, where healthcare and sanitation systems have been crippled due to the ongoing war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi group. Yemen has reported around 1.2 million suspected cholera cases since 2017, with 2,515 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the outbreak is accelerating again, with approximately 10,000 suspected cases reported per week.

The researchers sequenced the genomes of cholera bacteria samples collected in Yemen and nearby areas, including a Yemeni refugee center on the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border. They also included 74 other cholera samples from South Asia, the Middle East, and eastern and central Africa. By comparing these sequences to a global collection of over 1,000 cholera samples, they were able to determine the genetic relationship between different strains.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of genomic sequencing in understanding the origins and spread of diseases like cholera. By utilizing this technique, researchers can estimate the risk of future outbreaks and provide health authorities with more time to intervene. In the case of Yemen, the study reveals that the strain causing the cholera outbreak likely originated from eastern Africa before spreading to Yemen. However, further research is needed to identify the specific countries in eastern Africa from which the strain originated.

1081,"### Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that genetic mutations have been observed in the H7N9 strain of bird flu, which has been circulating in China since 2013. These mutations have made the virus more deadly to birds, but it is unclear if they make it more lethal for humans. In about 7% of recent cases, scientists have identified genetic changes suggesting that the viruses are resistant to Tamiflu, the recommended treatment for bird flu. However, this rate is similar to previous years, and constant change is a characteristic of all influenza viruses. The WHO emphasized that the risk of the virus spreading among people is low, as it mainly affects individuals in close contact with infected birds or other people. Since October, 460 people in China have been infected with bird flu, accounting for more than one-third of the 1,250 infections reported since 2013. Some scientists are concerned that China is not sharing enough information about the virus, as there was a sudden announcement of about 100 cases earlier this year, which could compromise efforts to track any changes in the virus' spread. The continuing bird flu worries highlight the world's vulnerability to the next flu pandemic, according to Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota.

1082,"### Context: The article discusses the positive results of a safety and efficacy study conducted by Shire on a drug called SHP465 for children and adolescents with ADHD. The article highlights that there is no discussion of the eventual price point of the drug, which is important considering the availability of cheaper generic alternatives like Adderall. The article also mentions the costs of other ADHD drugs such as Vyvanse and Concerta, which are around $250 for a 30-day supply. Generic Ritalin, on the other hand, costs around $45 for a month's supply. The article points out that companies sometimes develop new formulations of drugs to sell them at higher costs as new patented drugs, even if they are not more effective or safe than existing treatments.

The article notes that the benefits of SHP465 are explained in relation to a placebo and a standardized measurement of improvement, but there is no comparison made with existing treatments. It questions the need for a stimulant that lasts 16 hours and suggests that it would be cheaper to take a dose of an existing shorter-acting drug in the early afternoon.

The adverse effects of SHP465 are listed and found to be similar to those of other amphetamine drugs. The article mentions that the trial appears to be of high quality, but there is no accompanying peer-reviewed paper and the raw data and manipulated data are not available. It also raises concerns about the financial arrangements between the study's principal investigator and Shire, as the investigator has received payments for consulting for the company.

The article states that the drug maker hopes to begin marketing SHP465 in the second half of 2017, after clearing FDA approval. It also mentions that it is unclear if the drug is novel or in what way, as it is an amphetamine drug and others like it are already in use. The article concludes by stating that there does not appear to be any unjustifiable claim being made in the news release.
Claim: Shire Announces Positive Results of SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents with ADHD
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This news release announces the results of a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of a long-acting stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. The pharmaceutical company Shire completed this follow-up trial on the drug’s safety and efficacy after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required more data when Shire first sought approval for the drug. The drug was tested in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with ADHD. The company claims that the drug showed significant improvement in both children and adolescents when compared with a placebo and on the clinical global impression improvement scale, a standardized measurement of improvement. While the release is clearly targeted to investors and financial reporters, it was distributed and made available to a wide public audience. Just because a release is written for a business audience does not mean it should skimp on transparency. Its biggest weakness is the strong claims it makes without providing any links or references to published research where the results can be evaluated. We perused the company’s website for details of the study but came up empty-handed. The news release doesn’t mention the lead investigator’s financial relationship with the drug sponsor, projected costs of the new drug, nor make any comparisons with numerous similar drugs already on the market. This news release matters to the company since it is aiming to launch a new formulation (currently referred to as SHP465) of a drug similar to Adderall, also developed by Shire, which faces generic competitors. The new formulation essentially comes with a new patent for an old drug — the main difference being a longer half-life (or longer daytime effect) — 16 hours versus 12 hours for the current Adderall extended release pill. As the news release states, this new launch would extend Shire’s patent on its “ADHD Franchise” for many years: “Protection for Shire‘s ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029 “There are patents supporting Shire’s overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of  2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.” The news of a new drug formulation might be important for children and adolescents with ADHD who are frequently given amphetamines to treat their symptoms. But it is unclear how this drug differs from existing amphetamines already in use.",Shire Announces Positive Results of SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents with ADHD,"This news release describes a 16-hour stimulant drug, SHP465, that Shire hopes to market for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The release is a bit vague about the drug’s benefits and it doesn’t provide any quantification of the drug’s effectiveness. It also doesn’t mention the costs of the drug or compare the drug’s costs to existing treatments. The release does a good job of describing the drug’s adverse effects and it’s good to see the release mention that the drug is an amphetamine. The release also would have been stronger if it had mentioned that the study’s principal investigator has received payments from the drug maker.

1083,"### Context: The claim that consuming tainted lettuce caused more deaths in 2018 than homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants is false. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were two outbreaks of E.coli involving lettuce in 2018. The first outbreak resulted in five deaths and hospitalization of 96 people, while the second outbreak led to 62 cases of infection and 25 hospitalizations, but no deaths. In total, the CDC documented five deaths from consuming tainted lettuce in 2018.

On the other hand, there is no official nationwide tally of the number of homicides committed by undocumented immigrants. However, a report by the Cato Institute using official Texas Department of Public Safety data found that in 2015, undocumented immigrants were convicted of 46 homicides in Texas, which is a rate of 2.6 convictions per 100,000 undocumented immigrants. This is lower than the homicide conviction rate among U.S. citizens in Texas. Assuming that there was no significant change in the figures between 2011-2017 and 2018, the findings for 2015 can be considered a reasonable proxy for homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants in 2018.

Based on an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States in 2016, if the rate of homicide conviction seen in Texas was the same nationwide, it would equate to around 278 homicide convictions of undocumented immigrants throughout the United States in 2016, and a similar number in 2018.

Even though these figures relate to homicide convictions and not strictly homicides, it is reasonable to assume that the number of homicide convictions in any given year will not be significantly different from the number of prosecutable homicides in that same year. Therefore, it is safe to say that the number of homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants in 2018 was vastly higher than the five deaths caused by tainted lettuce.

Furthermore, between 2014 and 2016, the number of homicides recorded by the CDC increased each year, reaching 19,362 in 2016. If we estimate around 20,000 homicides took place in 2018, undocumented immigrants would need to account for only 0.02 percent of homicides, despite making up more than 3 percent of the total U.S. population. However, the Texas data shows that undocumented immigrants accounted for 5.9 percent of homicide convictions, which is higher than their share of the population but not 165 times lower.

In conclusion, the claim that consuming tainted lettuce caused more deaths in 2018 than homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants is false. The number of homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants is estimated to be significantly higher than the five deaths caused by tainted lettuce.
Claim: Consuming tainted lettuce caused more deaths in 2018 than homicides perpetrated by undocumented immigrants.

1084,"### Context: The article addresses the claim made by John McCain in an ad that Barack Obama supports teaching comprehensive sex education to kindergartners. The claim is based on a bill that was considered in the Illinois General Assembly in 2003. The bill aimed to expand sex education directives from grades 6 through 12 to grades K through 12. It required the curriculum to be medically accurate, include information on HIV prevention and contraceptives, and teach abstinence. The legislation also stated that course material and instruction should be age and developmentally appropriate.

However, the article clarifies that Obama was not a sponsor or co-sponsor of the bill, and it never became law. Obama voted for the legislation in committee on a party-line vote, but it never made it to a full Senate vote. Therefore, calling it one of Obama's accomplishments is incorrect.

The article also mentions that the bill's main intent was to ensure teenagers received medically accurate information. Expanding age-appropriate sex education to lower grades was a secondary effect, aimed at teaching children to avoid sex predators. Carol Ronen, the retired state senator who sponsored the bill, stated that Obama had nothing to do with it and called the claim ""a lot of hoopla.""

The article highlights that this is not the first time Obama has faced the accusation of supporting sex education for kindergartners. During his 2004 U.S. Senate campaign, his opponent Alan Keyes used the same claim. Obama clarified that he did not support explicit information about sex for young children and emphasized that instructional material must be age appropriate.

In conclusion, the claim that Obama's one education accomplishment was legislation to teach comprehensive sex education to kindergartners is false. Obama was not a sponsor or co-sponsor of the bill, it never became law, and it did not pass. The bill aimed to expand age-appropriate sex education to lower grades and teach children about avoiding sex predators. Obama clarified that he did not support explicit information about sex for young children.

1085,"### Context: In Lake Worth Beach, Florida, a confrontation between officials during a city commission meeting drew attention after Commissioner Omari Hardy criticized his colleagues for not taking the COVID-19 pandemic seriously. Hardy accused Mayor Pam Triolo and the rest of the commission of ignoring his request to hold an emergency meeting on the disease a week earlier. He also criticized the decision to cut off utilities for residents who had fallen behind on their payments, calling it a lack of leadership.

Hardy stated that electricity and water were cut off for 52 customers who had not paid their bills for 72 days, and an additional 53 customers were scheduled to have their services cut off the day after the contentious meeting. City Manager Michael Bornstein confirmed the initial service cuts and explained that they were carried out automatically for customers who had failed to pay their bills. However, he assured that these customers would be allowed to resume service without cost and that no service would be cut during the pandemic. Late payments would be due in full after the crisis passes.

Hardy expressed his frustration with his colleagues' lack of concern for the residents affected by the utility cuts. He stated that he had requested an emergency meeting to address the issue, but only one other commissioner supported the idea. As a result, dozens of families had their lights shut off, and Hardy lost his temper during the argument with Triolo.

In a Facebook post three days after the confrontation, Hardy reiterated his stance and expressed no regrets for confronting the mayor. He highlighted that his colleagues did not want to discuss the utility cuts and that he was disappointed in their lack of action.

The article focuses on the confrontation between officials in Lake Worth Beach, Florida, and the decision to cut off power and water services to residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1086,"### Context: A group of doctors and medical professionals called Doctors for Camp Closure held a protest demanding that Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officials allow them to administer flu vaccines to migrants in detention facilities in San Diego. The protest was in response to the deaths of three migrant children from influenza while in Border Patrol custody. The CBP has stated that they are not equipped to run a vaccination program and that it is not their practice to administer vaccines. The doctors argue that the Centers for Disease Control recommends vaccinating all children above the age of six months against the flu. They showed up at a detention facility ready to administer vaccines for free but were denied entry, leading to the protest. On Tuesday, about 70 doctors and others demonstrated outside the San Diego Sector Border Patrol headquarters, and four doctors and two others were arrested for blocking the driveway. After the arrests, officials briefly met with the group. On Wednesday, a vigil was held for those who have died in detention facilities, and the demonstration leaders met again with Customs and Border Protection officials. The Department of Homeland Security defended the decision to not let the doctors in, calling them ""radical political activists."" The doctors argue that they are addressing a public health issue and are saddened by the administration's attack on them. They had previously sent letters to the Trump administration requesting permission to vaccinate migrants but received no response. The CBP stated that they have increased their medical staff and that migrants sent to longer-term facilities usually receive vaccinations. However, many migrants are sent back to Mexico to wait out their asylum requests, where they live in crowded and unsanitary conditions.

The company, which cut 62 percent of its workforce last year to focus on developing the drug as a treatment for breast and colon cancers, said in December that it was not likely to succeed in a mid-stage colon cancer study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug, tivozanib, as a treatment for kidney cancer in June, saying that study results were inconsistent. The breast cancer study, which began in December 2012, was testing the efficacy of tivozanib in combination with another cancer drug on patients with locally recurrent or metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

1088,"### Context: Flooding in Bangladesh has resulted in the deaths of over 60 people and has displaced hundreds of thousands. The disaster management and relief ministry has reported that nearly 3 million people are struggling with the flooding, which is the worst in two years. As water levels begin to recede, authorities are concerned about outbreaks of infectious diseases in the country. The secretary of the disaster management and relief ministry, Shah Kamal, has stated that there is a possibility of water-borne diseases spreading and water treatment plants are being set up in flood-affected areas on a priority basis. At least 22 patients with symptoms of diarrhea and other ailments have been admitted to hospitals in the northern Bogra district.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in Bangladesh has deployed around 700 volunteers, including 100 staff, to provide relief operations in the northern and northwestern parts of the country. The Red Cross is providing food, drinking water, and other aid to flood victims, along with financial assistance of 4,500 taka ($54) per family. The government has allocated 45.80 million taka ($543,684) to help people rebuild their houses.

The flooding has also caused significant damage to infrastructure and agriculture. Preliminary assessments by the disaster management and relief ministry indicate that about 9 km of embankments, 172 km of roads, and nearly 250 bridges and culverts have been damaged. Early estimates from the agriculture department suggest that farmers have lost agricultural produce worth more than $40 million, and the losses are expected to be higher once a full list from different flood-affected areas is obtained.

In neighboring Nepal, torrential rain has caused landslides that resulted in the deaths of eight people and the disappearance of four others in the Gulmi district. This brings the total number of deaths from rains in the past two weeks in Nepal to 100, with 30 others still missing.

Overall, the flooding in Bangladesh has caused significant loss of life, displacement of people, and damage to infrastructure and agriculture. The government and organizations like the Red Cross are providing relief efforts to assist those affected by the floods.

1089,"### Context: The article discusses the potential land mines that Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, might face over his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA. Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nation's biggest hospital system but it became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 regarding whether it defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the investigation grew. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines and pleading guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case.

Scott's claim that two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were owned by Columbia/HCA is analyzed. The claim is based on a 1994 study that rated hospitals in terms of cost efficiency and patient outcomes. The study found that 11 out of 17 top-rated hospitals in Florida were Columbia/HCA properties, which is around 65 percent. Similar results were found in subsequent years of the study. However, the article raises the question of whether the rankings could be questioned because of the fraud-laden data that may have been used in the analysis.

The author of the study, Jean Chenoweth, states that they cannot definitively answer whether the rankings would have been affected by the Medicare fraud investigation. Chenoweth explains that their policy is to rescind any awards given on the basis of inaccurate data, but since Columbia/HCA settled the case, there is no proof or admission that the specific data used for the rankings was inaccurate.

In conclusion, Scott's claim that two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were owned by Columbia/HCA is supported by the study he references. However, the article highlights that the rankings could be questioned due to the fraud case and the lack of a public airing of the specific allegations. The author of the study does not know if the data used for the rankings was accurate or fraudulent. Therefore, while there is no evidence to say the rankings are bogus, the claim could benefit from additional information.

1090,"### Context: Florida is currently experiencing an outbreak of hepatitis A, with the Tampa Bay region leading the state in the number of cases. Pasco County has reported 466 new cases, Pinellas County has reported 369 cases, and Hillsborough County has reported 145 cases. Pinellas health officials have been the first in Florida to deploy ""foot teams"" to areas where people at risk for hepatitis A tend to gather, and they have administered 789 vaccines since May. Other counties in the state are now following suit and implementing similar efforts.

Since January 2018, Florida has recorded a total of 3,395 cases of hepatitis A. The virus affects the liver and spreads through contaminated feces. Symptoms include fever, dark urine, yellow-tinged skin or eyes, fatigue, and gastric issues. The virus can be transmitted through tainted food or water, as well as through sexual contact.

Hepatitis A outbreaks have been occurring in 29 states since 2016, with California and Michigan being the first affected. Nationally, over 25,000 cases have been reported in the past year. In the Tampa Bay area, there have been reports of food service workers infecting others at local restaurants. Public health experts state that the majority of hepatitis A cases are seen in white men in their young adult years to middle age. These individuals are often transient, have limited access to sanitation methods, and are more commonly drug users.

To combat the outbreak, free hepatitis A vaccines are being offered as part of an aggressive effort. Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees has declared a statewide emergency in response to the outbreak. The local health department has been visiting high-risk areas, such as motels where homeless individuals often stay, multiple times this year to provide vaccinations.

In summary, Florida is currently facing a hepatitis A outbreak, with the Tampa Bay region being the most affected. Efforts are being made to vaccinate at-risk populations, such as food service workers and transient individuals, in order to control the spread of the virus.

Medicaid does cover the type of surgery that Kimmel's son underwent and is a significant source of reimbursement for children's hospitals. Medicaid is the major source of health insurance coverage for children's hospitals and the specialized services they offer. It covers a broad range of services for children, including necessary services for their physical or mental health. Any state that accepts Medicaid funding must offer these services to children from birth through age 21. While Hoover's initial remark was incorrect, she did have a point about the relative lack of access for Medicaid beneficiaries. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that fewer physicians accept new patients with Medicaid compared to private insurance. However, it is important to note that Medicaid does cover the necessary services for children's health, including complex pediatric surgeries.

1094,"### Context: In 2006, Donald Trump violated Palm Beach ordinances by erecting an oversized American flag and pole at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The flag was installed on an 80-foot-high flagpole, exceeding the maximum height of 42 feet set by local zoning regulations. As a result, Trump was fined $1,250 per day by the Palm Beach town council. After six months of legal disputes, Trump proposed a solution to the city: he would donate the accumulated fine of $120,000 to veterans' organizations, move the flag and pole to a different location, and use a 30-foot flagpole instead. The city agreed to this proposal.

However, it was later revealed that Trump paid the fine through his nonprofit organization, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, instead of using his personal finances. The New York state attorney general sued Trump, his children, and his foundation, claiming that he illegally used the nonprofit for personal benefit, including his 2016 presidential campaign.

The article also mentions that Trump had a history of flagpole disputes. In 2014, he raised an oversized flag on a 70-foot flagpole at the Trump National Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, without obtaining a permit. The California Coastal Commission allowed the flag to stay, but the city had to revise its height rules.

Overall, the article confirms that Donald Trump violated Palm Beach ordinances by erecting an oversized flag and pole, and he donated the fine to veterans' organizations.

It also points out that there is no information on the number of mice that died during the study. The Cochrane Collaboration, a non-profit organization that researches evidence-based medicine, states that there is no proof that fish oil can treat or prevent various conditions, including cancer-related weight loss, depression, and dementia. The article also highlights that some fish contain high levels of mercury and other contaminants, which can be harmful, especially for pregnant women. The side effects of fish oil tablets, such as heartburn and nausea, are also mentioned. The article criticizes the news release for not clarifying that the study was conducted on mice with an unusual form of breast cancer, not healthy humans. It also questions the accuracy of the claim that 25% of women are affected by the HER-2 form of breast cancer, citing other sources that state a lower percentage. The funding sources and conflicts of interest are not mentioned in the news release, but the study was funded by various Canadian organizations. The article also notes that the news release does not mention evidence-backed strategies to reduce breast cancer risk, such as limiting alcohol consumption and exercising. Overall, the article criticizes the news release for providing premature medical advice and conveying unsupported claims about the benefits of omega-3s for cancer prevention.
Claim: Choose Omega-3s from fish over flax for cancer prevention, study finds

",false,"This news release reports on a study of tumor growth in mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer who were fed varying types of omega-3s. The news release offers plenty of unwarranted medical advice such as “choose omega-3s from fish over flax for cancer prevention” while failing to caution about the limitations of using mouse studies to predict human outcomes. The study points out that previous research has focused on the protective role of eating fish and other marine life against breast cancer, with little evidence regarding the impact of plant sources of omega-3s. Yet there’s no conclusive evidence that eating fish reduces cancer risk, and no mouse study can prove otherwise. News releases shouldn’t extrapolate from the evidence as this one does by conferring benefits seen in a few unusual mice onto all humans looking to prevent any form of cancer.

1097,"### Context: The article discusses a news release about a phase Ib study that tested a combination of the drug Keytruda with an experimental agent called SD-101 for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The news release does not mention the cost of Keytruda, which is approximately $12,500 a month or $150,000 a year. The release also overstates the benefits of the treatment, suggesting that it could provide an alternative for patients whose tumors have not responded to other therapies. However, the study was not designed to test this and did not show such results. The focus of the study was on safety and dosage, but the news release does not provide any information about the symptoms or side effects experienced by the patients. The release describes the research as ""early"" and provides some information about the trial size and what was measured, but it fails to clarify that any assessment of benefit may be due to Keytruda alone. The release could have included statistics on the number of people diagnosed with metastatic melanoma each year. The study used a combination of Keytruda and SD-101, but it was not a head-to-head trial comparing the two. The release notes that the therapy is experimental and not yet available, but it could have mentioned that Keytruda was approved by the FDA for use in metastatic melanoma in 2015. The researchers in the study attempted to change the tumor microenvironment by injecting the experimental drug directly into the metastatic sites. The article criticizes the headline and subheadline of the news release for being wishful thinking and not based on the study's design or findings. There is no evidence to support the claim that the new treatment could help people with advanced melanoma live longer.
Claim: Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This news release describes a phase 1b trial to test whether injecting an immune stimulant directly into metastatic melanoma lesions would change the environment around the tumor in ways that would make an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), more effective. But it’s important the readers are left primarily with the understanding that the results are from the dose-escalation phase–the part of a clinical trial where the researchers look to determine the “best” dose, typically meaning the highest dose that can be used without causing adverse symptoms or side effects. The study was not designed to see whether this approach was better than the approach currently used, or if it helped some people with metastatic melanoma live longer. Yet, the headline states: Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma. The sub-headline asserts, “the new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time.” And the first paragraph asserts that “a treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma … live longer.” None of that is known yet. It also is notable that the release made no mention of side effects among patients given this combination of therapies–even though that’s what this trial was examining. Immunotherapy has seen some of its greatest success in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. But it doesn’t work in all patients. Scientists hope by learning why it doesn’t always work they can develop new types of immunotherapies, new combinations of immunotherapies or new ways to use immunotherapy drugs that will achieve the desired response: allowing people with metastatic melanoma to live longer. This news release describes a study that included 22 people, nine of whom were receiving an immunotherapy for the first time. Seven of those nine had “a positive response” to the drug combination. In two, the tumors disappeared completely. That’s a good thing. Would the patients have had the same response if they had received Keytruda alone? Maybe. Maybe not. There’s no way to know. The study wasn’t designed to test that. But this release could easily lead to news articles that make that case.",Combination approach shows promise for beating advanced melanoma,"This news release describes a small, early-phase study of a combination of two drugs for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

1098,"### Context: The article discusses the ongoing debate in New Hampshire over funding for Planned Parenthood. Republicans have been trying to redirect taxpayer money away from family planning services because the funds also go to organizations that perform abortions. State Rep. Warren Groen, a Republican, is the sponsor of a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and has been quoted as saying that the organization specializes in ""cutting children into small pieces."" The bill, titled ""an act prohibiting the use of public funds for abortion services,"" would affect all health care providers that offer abortion services, not just Planned Parenthood. The bill argues that taxpayer dollars indirectly subsidize abortions by paying for various expenses of these providers. Planned Parenthood is the largest affected provider, receiving $737,586 from state contracts in 2014-15. It is important to note that the state already prohibits direct public funding for abortions through Medicaid, except in certain cases. Groen's bill specifically targets funding for other health services provided by Planned Parenthood and similar agencies. The article confirms that Groen did make the statement about ""cutting children into small pieces"" in a 2011 legislative hearing and has made similar statements recently. However, the article also notes that abortions account for a small fraction of the overall health care services provided by Planned Parenthood, with only 7% of visits in 2013 being for abortions. The article concludes that the headline from the liberal blog Miscellany Blue accurately summarizes Groen's proposal and statements.

### Explanation:
",true,"A headline in the liberal blog Miscellany Blue declared, ""Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’ "" Groen’s proposal doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood, but the effect of the bill would be to strip it, and other similar groups, of state funding. Meanwhile, Groen did make the statement about the group ""cutting children into small pieces"" four years ago, and he’s made similar declarations recently. We aren’t rating the substance of Groen’s accusations, but the headline summarizing what Groen said and what he’s proposing in the bill are generally accurate.","Miscellany Blue Says a ""lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’","A liberal blog, Miscellany Blue, says a """"lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for ‘cutting children into small pieces.’"""" The headline is accurate.

1099,"### Context: The National Health Commission said in a statement on Sunday that 25 of the latest cases involved people who had entered from abroad, compared with 18 such cases a day earlier. Five new locally transmitted infections were also reported on Saturday, all in the southern coastal province of Guangdong, up from a day earlier. The mainland has now reported a total of 81,669 cases, while the death toll has risen by three to 3,329. Though daily infections have fallen dramatically from the height of the epidemic in February, when hundreds of new cases were reported daily, Beijing remains unable to completely halt new infections despite imposing some of the most drastic measures to curb the virus’ spread. The so-called imported cases and asymptomatic patients, who have the virus and can give it to others but show no symptoms, have become among China’s chief concerns in recent weeks. The country has closed off its borders to almost all foreigners as the virus spread globally, though most of the imported cases involve Chinese nationals returning from overseas. The central government also has pushed local authorities to identify and isolate the asymptomatic patients. The health commission said 47 new asymptomatic cases were reported in the mainland on Saturday, compared with 64 a day earlier.

County officials say the health department needs the currently leased space for immunizations and other services. Planned Parenthood has 90 days to leave. Planned Parenthood’s clinic provides general health services, physician referrals, birth control, pregnancy testing, emergency contraceptives and HIV/STD testing. The clinic doesn’t perform abortions, but some argued abortion was a key issue in the debate since Planned Parenthood offers abortion services elsewhere. Jim Norton, a vice president of development for Planned Parenthood, said: “We should be talking about expanding health care services to the community, not shrinking them.”

Captain had been at Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium for over six years, where she became a beloved ambassador for education. Despite efforts to rehabilitate her, Captain's buoyancy issues and habit of eating sand and pebbles made it impossible for her to be released into the wild. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission was responsible for finding a permanent home for Captain, and they chose the Carpenter House as her ""forever home."" The historic home has been repurposed as a marine education center and features a remodeled swimming pool for Captain. The pool has a flat, clean bottom to prevent Captain from eating debris. The Carpenter House is set to open on March 3 and will provide an educational opportunity for visitors.

1102,"### Context: The claim that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned by the Rockefeller Foundation in ""Operation Lockstep"" is false. The rumor is based on a misinterpretation of a document published by the Rockefeller Foundation in 2010 called ""Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development."" This document envisioned four different scenarios, including one called ""Lock Step,"" which dealt with a hypothetical global pandemic. However, the document does not provide any instructions on how to manufacture a pandemic.

The image circulating on social media titled ""Operation Lockstep: From the Rockefeller Playbook"" is not from a real document. The quote ""Under the guise of a pandemic, we will create a prison state"" does not appear in the actual document from the Rockefeller Foundation. This quote seems to come from a faulty interpretation of the document by a Wordpress blog.

The similarities between the ""Lock Step"" scenario in the document and the COVID-19 pandemic are few and far between. The hypothetical pandemic in the document started in 2012, originated in wild geese, and killed 8 million people in the first 7 months. In comparison, the COVID-19 pandemic began in late 2019, is believed to have originated with bats, and has killed over 600,000 people within a similar time frame. The document also envisioned that the majority of deaths would occur in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, whereas the most deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in the United States.

The purpose of the Rockefeller Foundation's document was to explore different scenarios for the future of technology and international development in order to better prepare for potential challenges. It did not predict or plan for the COVID-19 pandemic.

In conclusion, the claim that the COVID-19 pandemic was planned by the Rockefeller Foundation in ""Operation Lockstep"" is based on misinformation and misinterpretation of a document. The document in question does not provide any instructions on how to manufacture a pandemic, and the similarities between the document's scenario and the COVID-19 pandemic are minimal.

1103,"### Context: A recent article titled ""New Blood Test May Rule Out Heart Attacks More Quickly"" fails to provide important information about the cost, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of the new troponin I test. The article only mentions that the new test is ""more predictive than other biomarkers"" and ""more sensitive than the existing one,"" without quantifying these claims or providing a sense of the scale of improvement. This lack of information is not helpful and can lead to a false impression of the test's benefits and utility.

The article also fails to discuss potential harms and does not critically analyze the quality of the evidence. It does not mention the limitations provided by the researchers in the journal article, such as potential bias in troponin measurements and the limited generalizability of the findings to other populations.

While the article mentions that the study was funded by two pharmaceutical companies, it does not include individual disclosures from the journal article itself. The sourcing of the article is also questionable, as the quotes from two independent physicians do not directly address the quality of the evidence. The comparisons made in the article lack substantiation with actual data.

The conclusions drawn by the article do not match those of the authors of the study. The availability of the new test is left unclear, as the article does not provide information about its experimental status, current use, or availability.

Overall, the article fails to provide important information about the new troponin I test, including cost, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, potential harms, limitations, and availability. This lack of information can lead to patient harm if decisions are made solely based on a single blood test. The article also does not critically analyze the quality of the evidence and relies on broad comparisons without substantiating them with data.
Claim: New Blood Test May Rule Out Heart Attacks More Quickly
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"It simply isn’t good enough to report on a new test being “more predictive” or “more sensitive” without giving actual data. How much more predictive? How much more sensitive? Why should readers care? Diagnosing a heart attack in the emergency room is as much of an art form as it is a science. Only a minority of people suspected of having one are actually diagnosed using a combined approach of a medical history, an electrocardiogram, a physical examination and finally laboratory tests. As our understanding of various blood markers improves, our tests have become more specific and the ability to correctly diagnose patients in a shorter period of time has improved. The use of a more specific maker of heart muscle injury and heart attack is important. As independent physicians quoted in the story explain, a more sensitive test could save a lot of money, could help with many emergency decisions and treatment,  and may result in improved outcomes. Because of significant gaps in important details, this story misrepresents what the authors of the study concluded.",New Blood Test May Rule Out Heart Attacks More Quickly,"This story reports on a new test for heart attacks that is more sensitive than the current test.

1104,"### Context: North Korea has announced the launch of a new state entity called the ""Treatment Tourism Exchange Corporation"" aimed at capitalizing on the rising demand for tourism, including medical care. The corporation will operate health clinics near hot springs that are believed to have mineral waters capable of treating neuralgia, arthritis, heart, and skin ailments. Private tourism is one of the few areas of business not blocked by sanctions imposed on North Korea due to its nuclear and missile programs. It is estimated that as many as 350,000 Chinese tourists have visited North Korea this year, potentially earning the authorities up to $175 million. The recent visit of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to a hot spring resort in the central alpine town of Yangdok is seen as a major construction project aimed at building a self-reliant economy.

The medical tourism campaign is seen as propaganda to show progress, but it could also appeal to Chinese tourists who are interested in oriental medicine. North Korea primarily offers natural tourist attractions and believes that combining them with elements of oriental medicine can be a money-making venture. However, a recent report by a government-affiliated health institute in South Korea highlighted the struggles of North Korea in providing basic healthcare. The report stated that primary-care providers, such as local clinics and doctors, lack basic equipment and supplies, making it difficult to provide proper medical consultation. The situation is not much better for secondary-care providers, including state hospitals in cities and counties.

In summary, North Korea is launching medical tourism to attract visitors from China. The new state entity, the Treatment Tourism Exchange Corporation, will operate health clinics near hot springs that are believed to have healing properties. Private tourism is one of the few areas not affected by sanctions, and North Korea hopes to capitalize on the rising demand for tourism, including medical care. However, a report from South Korea highlights the struggles of North Korea's healthcare system, stating that primary and secondary-care providers lack basic equipment and supplies.

1105,"### Context: Fotmer Life Sciences, a company in Uruguay, has made its first commercial shipment of medical cannabis to Australia. The shipment consisted of 10 kg (22 lb) of dried flowers with high levels of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. This marks a significant milestone for Uruguay's push into the growing market for legal cannabis, which has medical uses such as managing chronic pain in cancer patients or treating spasms associated with multiple sclerosis. The CEO of Fotmer Life Sciences, Jordan Lewis, stated that their goal is to create a billion-dollar industry in Uruguay within the next five to seven years. The company also plans to announce shipments to the European Union, with Germany being a key market.

Uruguay has been a pioneer in the legalization of marijuana, becoming the first country to legalize its growing, sale, and smoking in 2013. The country's progressive approach has been closely observed by other nations considering drug liberalization. Lewis predicts that the number of countries legalizing medical cannabis will almost double to around 80, creating a potential global market of $100 billion in the next decade.

Fotmer Life Sciences plans to begin exporting 100 kg of dried flowers and cannabis extracts each month in the coming weeks. The potential for the cannabis market is significant, with market forecasts suggesting that the U.S. cannabis market alone could be worth $80 billion by 2030.

The company's facilities, located in a science park complex near Montevideo, prioritize quality control and adhere to high global standards for making medicines and handling agricultural products. Each cannabis plant is assigned a number and bar code to track the production process and identify any genetic issues. The plants are then transferred to industrial-size greenhouses equipped with drying, curing, and packaging machinery.

Varela, a biochemist working at Fotmer Life Sciences, became interested in studying the uses of cannabis while doing a doctorate in the Netherlands. He believes that Uruguay's support for the industry has positioned the country at the forefront of the growing global market. Uruguay is focused on developing highly-qualified individuals with the necessary skills to meet the demands of the industry as legalization continues to expand globally.

1106,"### Context: Baxter Regional Medical Center (BRMC) in northern Arkansas has opened a new 16-bed adult behavioral health center to meet the needs of the community. The Hensley Senior Behavior Health Center at BRMC has been serving the 55 and older population for years, but there were no local options for those aged 18 to 54. The need for such a facility has been growing, as observed by Jodi Leeker, the program director at BRMC. Previously, young adults facing mental health crises had to travel to facilities in Batesville, Little Rock, Fayetteville, or West Plains, Missouri. The new unit offers medication management, individual, group, and family therapy, and programs to teach healthy coping skills. The average patient will stay in the unit for three to five days, and most insurance plans are accepted. The unit is staffed by primary-care physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers who address both medical and mental health issues. The unit has a calming color scheme and layout, resembling a high-end day spa. Patients have access to amenities such as a menu to select meals from and a nicely appointed day room. The staff at BRMC works to put together a discharge plan for each patient, including setting up outpatient therapy and follow-ups with the patient's primary care physician if needed.

1107,"### Context: The claim that modern caesarean sections were invented by midwives in Africa is partially supported by historical accounts. An article from 1999 in the Archives of Disease in Childhood - Fetal and Neonatal Edition provides a historical and anecdotal account of a caesarean delivery in Uganda in 1879. The account was given by Robert Felkin, who witnessed the procedure and described it in a lecture to the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society in 1884. Felkin observed that the procedure was performed by men and used banana wine as an anesthetic. The patient was tied to a bed, and a midline incision was made in her abdomen. The uterus was massaged to contract, and the wound was closed with iron needles and dressed with a paste made from roots. The patient recovered well, although her milk production was delayed.

While this account supports the claim that caesarean sections were performed in Africa before they became standard elsewhere, it does not provide evidence that midwives specifically invented the procedure. The article also mentions that similar reports of successful caesarean sections in Africa come from Rwanda, where botanical preparations were used for anesthesia and wound healing.

The article further explains that in Western society, women were largely denied admission to medical schools until the late nineteenth century, which limited their ability to perform caesarean sections. However, there are records of a woman named James Miranda Stuart Barry performing a successful caesarean section in South Africa while masquerading as a man and serving as a physician to the British army.

The development of modern caesarean sections in Western medicine was influenced by advancements in anesthesia, antisepsis, and asepsis. The use of uterine sutures and transverse incisions in the lower segment of the uterus helped reduce the risk of infection and uterine rupture. The introduction of antibiotics after World War II further contributed to the prevalence of caesarean sections in labor and delivery.

Overall, while the historical account supports the claim that caesarean sections were performed in Africa before they became standard elsewhere, it does not specifically attribute the invention of the procedure to midwives. The article highlights the importance of advancements in anesthesia, antiseptic practices, and surgical techniques in the development of modern caesarean sections.

1108,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, that Hillary Clinton took money from the kings of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Oman, and Yemen. The article clarifies that while the Clinton Foundation has received donations from these countries, there is no evidence that Clinton herself personally benefited from the money. The Clinton Foundation is a global charity that partners with governments and non-government organizations to address issues such as AIDS and poverty. It has received millions of dollars from foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, which has been a long-time partner of the United States in regional security and counterterrorism efforts. Oman, another donor to the foundation, has a military cooperation agreement with the US and plays a role in regional stability in the Middle East. Morocco, which donated to the foundation to hold a conference, is considered a strong partner in counterterrorism efforts by the US. However, the article notes that Yemen, which does not have a king, has not made any donations to the foundation. The article concludes that while Priebus' claim is partially accurate in terms of the countries that have donated to the Clinton Foundation, it is misleading to suggest that Clinton herself received the money.

1109,"### Context: The claim is about a photograph showing a dead man whose co-workers took a selfie with him, thinking he was sleeping. The article explains that the claim is based on a screenshot of a headline that was shared on a Facebook page. However, no related article or source was provided. A search for the headline did not yield any results, suggesting that it may be old or non-existent.

The attached image, however, has a different story. It was originally shared on Reddit in 2016 on the r/PSBattles subreddit, where users were encouraged to edit the photo of a man sleeping in front of his co-workers. The same image also appeared on Reddit's r/TIFU subreddit, but that post has since been deleted.

On February 3, 2016, the Huffington Post covered the viral sensation of the sleeping man. The man in the photo was identified as Eduard Paraschivescu, an intern in Montreal, Canada. He had fallen asleep at his desk during training at a company called Gsoft. When he woke up, his co-workers were laughing and taking pictures and videos of him. He also received a message asking him to bring doughnuts the next day. Paraschivescu himself posted the photo on Reddit, where it gained attention on the PhotoshopBattles subreddit.

The article explains that the screenshot of the headline, ""Man suffers heart attack, dies at work, coworkers gather for group selfie thinking he'd fallen asleep,"" is an example of how ""fake news"" items are created. The viral photo of the sleeping intern from 2016 was paired with an untrue headline reflecting an old urban legend about an office worker who remained dead and unnoticed at their desk for five days. This previous viral claim highlighted fears that employees are seen as disposable by their employers. The article concludes by mentioning that the original photograph gained popularity on various subreddits before becoming a viral hit on its own in 2016.

In summary, the claim about the photograph showing a dead man whose co-workers took a selfie with him is based on a screenshot of a headline that lacks a related article or source. The attached image is actually of a sleeping intern from 2016, and the original photograph gained popularity on Reddit before becoming a viral hit.

1110,"### Context: According to an article, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke claimed that under Governor Scott Walker's policies, the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than workers in Minnesota. The article examines this claim and finds that it is accurate. The article cites three different sources that all show Minnesota workers earning more than Wisconsin workers. According to survey-based estimates from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the annual average wage of Minnesota workers in May 2013 was $47,370, which is $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin. Additionally, average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin's $48,997, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. When excluding proprietor's income and focusing on regular salaries and wages, the gap between the two states is $5,757 in Minnesota's favor. The article also notes that the wage gap between Minnesota and Wisconsin has existed since at least the 1960s and has gradually grown over time. While experts agree that a governor's actions have a limited effect on a state's economy, Burke's claim that Walker's policies are linked to the wage gap is supported by the fact that the gap did not narrow in Walker's first two years in office. The article concludes that while the gap has grown or held steady under Walker's policies, it is a longstanding disparity that existed and grew under governors of both political parties. Therefore, the claim made by Burke is rated as accurate.

1111,"### Context: A Facebook post claimed that a series of 11 photos were from the 1918 flu pandemic. However, a fact-checking investigation found that only five of the photos were actually from that time period. The first photo, featuring two women with bags over their heads, was actually taken in 1953 during a smog and smoke event in Philadelphia. Another photo of women in gas masks tending to a stroller was from a gas test during World War II in 1941. An advertisement for Bell Telephone Co. that mentioned quarantine and the sick was not connected to the 1918 pandemic, but rather existed as early as 1910. An image of an ad encouraging people to stay home was created in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A photo of two women wearing masks while visiting over a car window was taken in 1929 during a separate flu epidemic. 

However, there were five photos that were indeed from the 1918 influenza pandemic. One photo showed a woman wearing a mask in February 1919, following the First World War. Another photo depicted a sign on a streetcar that read ""Spit spreads death,"" taken in October 1918 in Philadelphia. An image of rows of beds used for treating flu patients during the 1918 pandemic was also confirmed to be from that time period. A photo of a masked newsboy outside a closed theater during the influenza pandemic was taken between October 5 and November 11, 1918. Lastly, a news announcement featuring a Red Cross nurse wearing a mask was legitimately from 1918.

In conclusion, while the Facebook post claimed that all 11 photos were from the 1918 flu pandemic, only five of them were actually from that time period. The other six photos were from different events and time periods, including World War II, a separate flu epidemic in 1929, and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Sucralose, the artificial sweetener in Splenda, has undergone extensive safety testing and has been approved by regulatory agencies in multiple countries. Studies have shown that sucralose is well-tolerated by humans and does not have any significant risks associated with its consumption. The claim that only two human studies were conducted on sucralose is false, as there have been over 100 scientific studies conducted on its safety. The idea that sucralose is ""unnatural"" and therefore unsafe is also unfounded, as sucralose is a non-caloric sweetener that is derived from sugar but has been chemically altered to make it non-metabolizable. The claim that sucralose can cause seizures, dizziness, migraines, allergic reactions, weight gain, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal issues is based on anecdotal reports and has not been confirmed by scientific studies. The lawsuit between the manufacturers of Splenda and Equal over false advertising claims is outdated and irrelevant to the safety of sucralose. The recent study that purportedly linked Splenda to cancer in mice has been criticized for its methodology and dissonant findings, and regulatory agencies have stated that the conclusions of the study are not supported by the data. Overall, the safety and effectiveness of sucralose have been well-supported by scientific research, and it is considered safe for human consumption.

Genpets are artworks created by Canadian artist Adam Brandejs in 2005. They are plastic and latex sculptures with circuitry and robotics, designed to provoke thought about the concept of bioengineering. The purpose of Genpets is to make people consider the ethical implications of bioengineering and how it may be used in the future. The artist does not endorse or oppose bioengineering but aims to raise questions about corporate ethics and the responsible use of technology. The Genpets sculptures were exhibited in a Toronto storefront and generated strong reactions from the public, with some protesting against the idea of bioengineered creatures trapped in plastic and others expressing interest in buying them. The artist believes that society's increasing view of life as disposable commodities is a concern. The article concludes by mentioning some of Adam Brandejs' other works, such as the animatronic flesh shoe and a prosthetic zipper.

1115,"### Context: The article discusses a Facebook post by Cristina Higgins, an American living in Italy, about the severity of the COVID-19 crisis in the country. The post gained significant attention and was shared over half a million times. Higgins confirmed that she is the true author of the post and is currently living in Italy.

The claims made by Higgins in her post are generally accurate. She emphasized that COVID-19 is more lethal than the seasonal flu, with a mortality rate of about 3% compared to 0.1% for the flu. Italy has implemented strict measures to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, closures of nonessential businesses, and social distancing. The country's healthcare system is overwhelmed, with over 80% of hospital beds in the hardest-hit province occupied by COVID-19 patients. Doctors are struggling to meet patients' needs and are even rationing care.

The article also highlights the importance of young people taking precautions, as they can catch and spread the virus to more vulnerable populations. The goal is to minimize the number of people each sick person infects through measures like school closures and event cancellations.

The full text of Higgins' Facebook post is included in the article, where she urges individuals to change their behavior to limit contagion and prevent their own countries from experiencing the same crisis as Italy.

Overall, the article confirms the authenticity of Higgins' post and verifies the accuracy of her claims about the severity of the COVID-19 crisis in Italy.

1116,"### Context: The article discusses a form of strep throat called invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease (iGAS) that can infect the nasal passage, sinuses, face, and even other organs. It explains that while most cases of strep throat and other strep infections are relatively mild, sometimes the bacteria can become invasive and cause more serious and potentially life-threatening infections. Symptoms of an iGAS infection can include fever, chills, sore throat, dizziness, confusion, severe pain, and redness or swelling around a wound or injured area. In severe cases, iGAS can lead to conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as a ""flesh-eating disease""), myositis, myonecrosis, and Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (StrepTSS), which can result in total organ failure.

The article mentions a cautionary tale shared by an Idaho couple on Facebook about their son's strange mark on his face, which was ultimately diagnosed as a form of strep throat that infects the sinuses. It highlights that iGAS infections often occur in clusters and affect groups more likely to be immunocompromised, but recent research suggests that adults and children of any age and in any medical condition can contract the disease. However, severe iGAS infections remain quite rare.

The article also mentions that outbreaks of iGAS have occurred in closed environments such as nursing homes and hospitals. It states that while many initial reports of iGAS described cases in adults, children are also affected by the infection. It provides examples of the incidence of invasive streptococcal disease in different populations, such as a small Minnesota community where 26 cases per 100,000 population were recorded and children in Utah where the incidence reached 14 cases per 100,000 population.

In summary, the article confirms the claim that a form of strep infection is capable of affecting the nasal cavity and face. It provides information about invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease (iGAS), its symptoms, potential complications, and its occurrence in different populations. It emphasizes that while severe iGAS infections are rare, they can be life-threatening and require immediate medical treatment.

1117,"### Context: The article discusses a viral Facebook post that claims N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks are ineffective in protecting against the spread of COVID-19. The post selectively cites recommendations from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

Regarding N95 masks, the post claims that when exhaling through an N95 respirator, the design allows potentially infectious breath to be exhaled without filtration. This claim is mostly true, but it only applies to N95 respirators with valves. Masks with valves were designed for construction/factory workers or miners to keep out dust and particles, not to prevent infectious particles from leaving the mask. The San Francisco Department of Public Health has stated that N95 masks with valves are not safe and may actually propel germs further. Hospitals primarily use N95 masks without valves, and OSHA guidelines focus on their ability to prevent workers from inhaling small particles.

The post also claims that surgical masks are ineffective and can make the wearer a ""walking virus dispenser."" While OSHA guidelines state that surgical masks protect against potentially infectious splashes and sprays and contain the wearer's respiratory droplets, they offer ineffective protection against transmission via airborne particles due to their loose fit. The post suggests that surgical masks should be changed or thrown out every 20-30 minutes, but OSHA simply recommends proper disposal after use.

Regarding cloth masks, the post claims that they do not filter anything and can make the wearer sicker. It suggests that the moisture caught in cloth masks can lead to mildew and cause symptoms such as dry coughing and enhanced allergies. However, OSHA guidelines already state that cloth masks are ineffective filters against airborne particles. They are worn to protect others from respiratory droplets, and wearing them does not pose a significant risk of breathing in unhealthy amounts of carbon dioxide. OSHA and CDC recommend washing cloth masks after use to prevent the danger of dirty masks.

In conclusion, the Facebook post is correct in stating that N95 masks, surgical masks, and cloth masks can be dangerous and/or ineffective in protecting against the spread of COVID-19, based on CDC and OSHA guidelines. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness and recommendations vary depending on the type of mask.

1119,"### Context: The article examines the claim made by Hillary Clinton that ""we are seeing kids who are healthier"" and assesses the validity of this statement. The article acknowledges that there is no single agreed-upon measure for children's health, but focuses on obesity rates and nutrition as indicators.

Regarding obesity rates, the article states that there are some signs of improvement among children aged 11 and under, but not among older children. However, the article cautions that these improvements are not significant and that there are no continued increases, especially among young children.

In terms of nutrition, the government's Healthy Eating Index shows an increase from 49.5 in 2005-06 to 55.1 in 2011-12 for children aged 2-17. However, the article quotes an obesity researcher who is skeptical that improving nutrition alone will improve obesity rates. Additionally, the article notes that it would take a long time to see any effect on obesity rates nationally.

The article also examines other measures of children's health that fall outside of Michelle Obama's work on nutrition and exercise. The Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics reports negative trends in adolescent depression, limited activities due to chronic conditions, and asthma rates among children. However, the article acknowledges that there have been dramatic reductions in mortality rates among all children since 1990, with greater declines among poor children, indicating a decrease in inequality in mortality.

In conclusion, the article states that while there are some improvements in obesity rates among younger children and better nutrition according to the Healthy Eating Index, there are negative trends in other measures of children's health. The article suggests that there are longer-term gains in children's health, particularly in terms of mortality rates and reductions in drug and alcohol abuse and teen pregnancy rates. Overall, the article suggests that the claim made by Hillary Clinton is not entirely accurate, as there are both positive and negative trends in children's health.

1120,"### Context: Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island has signed a new law that requires public colleges and universities in the state to establish a plan for addressing students' mental health needs promptly. The law discourages relying solely on off-campus services and aims to prevent suicides at higher education institutions. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Rhode Island is now one of 11 states with a law addressing suicide prevention in higher education.

However, the University of Rhode Island (URI), Rhode Island College, and Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) do not currently have suicide prevention policies that meet the new requirement. While these institutions offer counseling and mental health services, they need to develop formal policies on suicide prevention. URI has assured lawmakers that it is well-prepared to implement the provisions of the legislation and has existing resources and systems in place to respond to student concerns. CCRI is currently working on a formal policy on suicide prevention, and Rhode Island College's counseling center director, Chantelle Pseekos, supports any requirement that promotes student safety and destigmatizes mental health services.

The new law will prompt schools to review their mental health services and identify any gaps. The nonprofit Jed Foundation, which works to prevent suicide among teenagers and young adults, believes that the law will encourage schools to consider what they can provide on campus rather than relying solely on community providers. This approach is expected to make seeking help for mental health issues more normalized.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in June that suicide rates have been increasing in almost every state. In Rhode Island, the suicide rate rose by approximately 34% from 1999 to 2016. The new law requires schools to present their plans, along with any new policies and training being implemented, to legislative leaders and the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education by January 1.

Overall, the new law in Rhode Island aims to prevent suicides at public colleges and universities by requiring institutions to establish plans for addressing students' mental health needs promptly. It encourages schools to develop on-campus services and aims to destigmatize mental health services. The law comes in response to rising suicide rates in the state and across the country.

1121,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions that there is a link between legalized marijuana and violence. Sessions stated that his conversations with Nebraska Attorney General Douglas Peterson, who is concerned about marijuana flowing in from Colorado, helped bring this issue to his attention. However, the article argues that both claims lack credible data to support these assertions.

The article mentions that Peterson and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt attempted to seek permission from the United States Supreme Court to sue the state of Colorado over alleged increases in crime. The filing alleged that marijuana from Colorado was entering Nebraska in higher numbers since legalization, but no empirical evidence has been introduced to demonstrate that this marijuana has led to any increase in drug-trade related violence in Nebraska.

The article also discusses a report by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, which raised concerns about various issues related to marijuana legalization in Colorado, including increased crime rates. However, the report itself states that the data reported does not infer that the data is due to the legalization of marijuana.

The article then mentions a study published in the journal PLOS One, which investigated changes to crime rates in states before and after the legalization of medical marijuana. The study found no evidence of a crime exacerbating effect of medical marijuana legalization and suggested that it may be correlated with a reduction in homicide and assault rates.

Another study presented at a conference found that medical marijuana legalization led to a significant decrease in arrest rates for violent crimes among both juveniles and adults. A study published in the Journal of Drug Issues also found no evidence of negative spillover effects from medical marijuana laws on violent or property crime.

The article concludes that the arguments attempting to make connections between marijuana legalization and violent crime lack credible evidence. It suggests that the claim made by Sessions is similar to speculative fears that have historically been used in campaigns against ending federal marijuana prohibition.

These classes combine conditioning moves and cardio interval training with the fun of drumming. Pound, created by Kirsten Potenza and Cristina Peerenboom, is a 45-minute class that includes intensive cardio and ab work. Participants spend about 40% of the time standing, 40% seated, and 10% on their backs. Dr. J. Timothy Lightfoot, director of the Sydney and JL Huffines Institute for Sports Medicine and Human Performance at Texas A&M University, believes drumming is a physiologically taxing activity that can burn around 400 calories in a workout. Drumming engages all extremities simultaneously, making it a unique form of exercise. Drums Alive, created by Carrie Ekins, combines aerobic dance and drumming and is popular in senior centers as well as gyms. The program offers sitting programs for those who can't stand and programs for kindergartens and schools. Drumming workouts are accessible to people of all ages and fitness levels, with a learning curve that can be overcome in a few months. Unlike other classes that require a certain level of fitness or experience, drumming classes can be enjoyed by anyone.

1123,"### Context: A new study has shown promising results for two experimental Ebola vaccines. The study, conducted by the US and Liberian governments, as well as other organizations including GlaxoSmithKline and Merck, found that both vaccines were able to increase a person's antibody response to the Ebola virus. However, the study was not able to determine if the vaccines actually prevent the disease, as it did not have enough time to see if the vaccines prevented sickness and death from Ebola. The study also found that the level of serious adverse events was higher in the placebo group than in either vaccine group, with most of the serious adverse events attributed to malaria. The article notes that there is currently no proven successful treatment against Ebola, so the availability of an Ebola vaccine would be important to address. The article also mentions that readers would want to know if the vaccines will actually prevent the disease, and while the study showed increased antibody levels, it did not determine the level of antibody response needed for protection. The article provides useful context by mentioning that the study was the first placebo-controlled study of two vaccines against the Ebola virus, and that the vaccines were developed by pharmaceutical companies. However, it does not mention that several of the researchers have economic ties to these companies. Overall, the article does a good job of summarizing the study's findings and putting them in context, but it could have addressed the potential cost and limitations of the vaccines, as well as the possibility of using them in the event of a new epidemic.

That said, we think the story would have been stronger had it been more clear on the industry connections behind the study, and if it had discussed availability of the vaccine–especially if a new outbreak occurs. Vaccine development for Ebola would be a big step forward in combatting a deadly infection.

1124,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by the Facebook page ""Live Action"" that Planned Parenthood lies about providing prenatal care. The video presented by Live Action quotes snippets from speeches by Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, and Lori Lamerand, the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan, to support their claim. However, the article explains that these quotes were taken out of context. Richards was listing various services provided by Planned Parenthood, not claiming they offer only or primarily prenatal care. Lamerand's quote was also taken out of context from a speech where she spoke about vital services like birth control and cancer screenings.

The article points out that although Planned Parenthood does provide prenatal care services, it is not a primary part of their operation. According to their annual report, they provided 17,419 instances of prenatal care services compared to over 3 million STD tests and over 300,000 abortions. The article also states that Live Action's claim that only 5 out of 97 Planned Parenthood facilities provide prenatal care is misleading. There are many Planned Parenthood clinics that advertise prenatal services, and even those that do not provide prenatal care offer resources to assist patients in finding such care.

The article highlights that Live Action's video is based on the implication that Planned Parenthood claimed to provide prenatal care services at all of their facilities, which is not the case. A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood stated that not every single one of their health centers provides prenatal care, and they have never said otherwise. The organization's website states that their health centers focus on prevention, with 80% of their patients receiving services to prevent unintended pregnancy.

The article concludes by noting that Live Action chose to compare the number of prenatal services provided by Planned Parenthood to the number of abortions, giving the misleading impression that Planned Parenthood rarely provides reproductive health services other than abortions. In reality, Planned Parenthood provides more STD screenings, contraception services, and cancer screenings than they do abortions.

1125,"### Context: A nurse at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, named Christa Jordan wanted to donate her kidney to her friend and patient, Dayshanae Hosman, who has a genetic condition called Alagille syndrome and went on dialysis in April. However, the University of Kansas Hospital found an even better match for Hosman, a 25-year-old altruistic donor named Ky Kanaman. Jordan was then informed that she was a better match for a person on the transplant list named Lauro Zuniga, whom she didn't know. Jordan agreed to give her kidney to Zuniga if Kanaman donated his to Hosman, thus starting a kidney donation chain.

Carolina Perez, Zuniga's mother, was not a match for her son. However, when Jordan agreed to give her kidney to Zuniga, Perez discovered that she could donate one of her kidneys to a stranger on the university hospital's list named Matt Lewis. This created a chain of kidney donations, with each donor giving to a recipient they didn't know.

Donation chains like this are rare and require extensive planning by hospitals. It starts with a donor wanting to give to someone they aren't a good match with. The hospital then finds a recipient that the donor matches with but doesn't know, sparking conversations to find the best donor-recipient matches.

On October 29 and 30, six surgeries were conducted at the two hospitals involved. The three donors and three recipients finally got together at Children's Mercy, with many meeting for the first time. Matt Lewis, one of the recipients, expressed his gratitude and said, ""I feel like I won the lottery.""

Overall, this article highlights the story of Christa Jordan, a nurse who wanted to donate her kidney to her friend and patient. However, due to a better match being found, a kidney donation chain was initiated, involving multiple donors and recipients.

1126,"### Context: Novartis is hopeful for its novel heart drug, canakinumab, despite its ""modest"" benefit. The drug was tested on heart attack survivors and was found to reduce the risk of another major cardiac event by 15% compared to a placebo. However, the article points out that the study did not provide the absolute numbers of events, only the events per 100 person-years. In the placebo group, there were 4.50 cardiac events per 100 person-years, while in the group receiving 150 mg doses of canakinumab, there were 3.86 events per 100 person-years. The 150 mg dose was the only statistically significant result, specifically for non-fatal heart attacks. The article also mentions that the study did not discuss the harms of the drug in depth, such as the frequency and severity of side effects. 

The article highlights that there are concerns about the high cost of the drug and potential fatal infection risks. It mentions that there are other effective and less expensive alternatives for secondary cardiac disease prevention, such as smoking cessation, aspirin, statins, and blood pressure control. Despite these concerns, Novartis plans to seek regulatory approval for the drug's use against heart disease.

The article acknowledges that the drug has novel effects and targeting, but it does not rely on the news release. It includes commentary from a drug industry analyst and the study's accompanying editorial. The article also notes that the drug industry's research costs are often opaque, making it important to explain the realities of medicine's pricing system to the public.

Overall, the article provides a balanced view of the potential benefits and concerns surrounding Novartis' novel heart drug. It emphasizes the need for transparency in pricing and the importance of considering alternative treatments.

1127,"### Context: The article fact-checks a claim made by CNN commentator Van Jones during a discussion about institutional racism in law enforcement. Jones stated that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but end up going to prison six times more often. The article investigates the validity of this claim.

The article references a 2014 National Research Council report that states there is little difference in drug use between blacks and whites. The report also mentions that drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites in recent years.

To determine the rates of imprisonment for drug crimes, the article turns to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the United States Sentencing Commission. Adjusting for the number of blacks and whites, the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites. This aligns closely with Jones' claim.

The article also mentions a statistic from the NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet, which asserts that African-Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites. However, the source for this statistic is not provided, and it may be outdated.

The article explores possible reasons for the disparity in drug-related imprisonment rates. One reason is that blacks are more likely to get caught selling drugs in public, making them easier targets for arrest. Additionally, blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to have a previous criminal record, which can result in longer sentences.

In conclusion, the article finds that African-Americans do not use drugs at a higher level than whites, and the rate of their incarceration for drug offenses is very close to what Jones claimed. The article rates Jones' claim as true.
Claim: African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but ""wind up going to prison six times more.

1128,"### Context: The article criticizes a news release about a study that claims omega-3 fatty acid supplements may lower breast cancer risk in postmenopausal obese women. The release fails to mention the cost of the supplements, which can be expensive for most Americans. It also does not provide specific information on how much the supplement may lower a woman's risk or mention any potential harms or side effects. The release presents the findings of a small subgroup as if they were the main results of the study, without mentioning that the original study did not find a difference in breast density changes in any of the treatment arms. The significant result was only found in women with a BMI greater than 29. The release also inaccurately states the number of women who completed the clinical trial and the number of groups they were divided into. It fails to mention that other trials have found that the drug Raloxifene does not have an effect on breast density. The release does not mention any other approaches to reducing breast cancer risk, such as limiting alcohol, not smoking, controlling weight, breastfeeding, and exercising. It does note that the supplement used in the study, Lovaza, is FDA approved and requires a prescription. The release does not provide any evidence of novelty and fails to provide data to back up the claim that omega-3 fatty acids may reduce breast cancer risk.
Claim: Omega-3 Fatty Acids May Lower Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Obese Women
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This release describes the results of a study testing whether omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer in obese women by reducing the density of their breast tissue. Higher breast tissue density is recognized as a marker for increased breast cancer risk. The study involved a small group of women who received the omega-3 fatty acid, the omega-3 in tandem with a chemo-preventative drug Raloxifene, the drug alone, or no treatment at all. According to the release, at the end of two years, women considered obese (their body mass index — BMI — was greater than 29) showed a reduction in breast tissue density, which the researchers argued reduced their cancer risk. However, this is misleading. This finding is from a small subgroup of obese women within the already-small study. The main finding of the study — which is never even mentioned in the news release — is that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density whether taken alone or in tandem with Raloxifene. The release also omitted projected costs and harms of the prescription-only supplement used in the study. The American Cancer Society predicts that 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year and that more than 40,000 women will die from this disease. Easy actions that women can take to prevent this disease, or at least reduce their risk of getting it, are of almost universal interest to the public. If it is shown that taking a readily available supplement like omega-3 fatty acids will reduce breast cancer risk in obese women, that’s information that will be of wide interest.",Omega-3 Fatty Acids May Lower Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Obese Women,"This news release from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) summarizes a small subgroup analysis of a large clinical trial that found that daily supplements of omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of developing breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are obese. The release does a good job of describing the study and the subgroup analysis, but it doesn’t provide any quantitative data to back up the claims. It also doesn’t mention any potential harms or side effects of the supplements, and it doesn’t mention the cost of the supplements. The release also misstates the number of women who completed the clinical trial and the number of groups they were divided into.

1129,"### Context: The claim that HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin is not accurate. While black women have consistently been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS at higher rates than other women, HIV/AIDS incidence rates for Travis County women have actually declined for most of the past decade. In 2014, the rate of new HIV diagnoses for black females was 16 per 100,000 black women, up from 12.3 in 2013. However, there was a 27% drop in new HIV diagnoses for black females between 2013 and 2014. The rates of HIV and AIDS among African-American males and females in Travis County have consistently been higher than the rates among Hispanics and whites. Poverty is a key factor contributing to the higher rates of HIV/AIDS among African-American women, as it can result in less access to care and a failure to know one's HIV status. Additionally, stigma, fear, discrimination, homophobia, and negative perceptions about HIV testing can also place African-American women at higher risk. However, it is important to note that the overall incidence rates of HIV/AIDS among women in Travis County have declined over the past decade. The claim made by Austin City Council Member Ora Houston that HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin is not supported by the data.

1130,"### Context: The article discusses the various speculations and rumors surrounding the meaning of the word ""covfefe"" that President Trump tweeted in May 2017. Some people speculated that it could be a code or an Arabic word, while others claimed it was a Yiddish word. However, the article debunks these claims.

Regarding the Arabic speculation, the article states that Google Translate does not provide any translation for ""covfefe"" in Arabic. Additionally, a linguist and language instructor fluent in Arabic dialects confirms that the word has nothing to do with the Arabic language. The closest translation for ""I will stand up"" in Arabic is ""sa aqif.""

As for the Yiddish speculation, the article mentions a rumor that ""covfefe"" is a Yiddish word meaning ""a futile search"" or ""a pointless and false quest."" However, experts from the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research and New York University's Linguistics Department confirm that ""covfefe"" is not a Yiddish word. They also state that the legend cited in the rumor is likely made up.

In conclusion, the article dismisses the claims that ""covfefe"" has any specific meaning in Arabic or Yiddish. It highlights that Google Translate can be unreliable and that the Yiddish experts consulted do not recognize the word. The true meaning of ""covfefe"" remains unknown, and the article suggests that a Russian connection might be more plausible given Trump's previous use of Yiddish borrowings.

During her campaign for the presidential nomination, she expressed openness to the idea of allowing all prisoners, including the bomber, to vote, but she did not advocate for it. Harris emphasized that she believes people who have served their sentences and been released should be able to vote.

1132,"### Context: The article titled ""Chelation based on faulty premise"" discusses the use of chelation therapy as a treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children. The article highlights the lack of evidence and potential harms associated with this unconventional therapy.

The article mentions that costs are not mentioned, but the research indicates that suppository treatments cost around $119 for five treatments, while a liquid formula costs $46 for 100 mL. It emphasizes that costs are particularly important in unconventional therapies as they are mostly out of pocket expenses.

Regarding the benefits of chelation therapy, the article states that the reported benefits are anecdotal and reported by parents. It notes that no credible, evidence-based benefits have been seen, as mentioned in the story.

The article highlights the significant harms associated with chelation therapy, including the depletion of essential minerals and even death. It acknowledges that there is very little, if any, evidence to support the use of chelators to treat ASD. It mentions that a controversial research study on chelation therapy in children with ASD was canceled due to the death of a child undergoing chelation and harmful effects on cognitive function seen in animal testing.

The article also mentions that a review of scientific studies conducted by the Institute of Medicine failed to show a link between a vaccine containing a mercury-based preservative and ASD. It emphasizes that the story correctly notes the lack of evidence for the use of chelators in treating ASD.

The article highlights the disease-mongering surrounding the unfounded and potentially dangerous use of chelators to treat or ""cure"" ASD in children. It mentions that the story provides information through interviews with several medical experts who all note the lack of evidence and potential harms associated with chelation therapy.

The article suggests that the story could have mentioned the only approved drug for ASD, resperidone, and the use of behavioral interventions as ""best practice"" for managing some manifestations of ASD.

It acknowledges that chelators are available in various forms, including creams, capsules, suppositories, and intravenous infusions. It also mentions that chelation therapy has been used by thousands of parents on their children with ASD and that its use is not new.

Overall, the article supports the claim that chelation therapy for ASD lacks evidence, poses significant harms, and is a potentially dangerous and unfounded treatment.

Chelation is based on the largely discredited view that mercury in vaccines triggers autism. Under this theory, removing heavy metals like mercury from the body will ‘cure’ autism. This story does a good job of presenting evidence about this harmful and potentially fatal practice. It successfully addresses the disease-mongering that could result around this emotionally charged issue. The story was well done but could have included a few more details such as the cost of various chelation treatment.

1133,"### Context: Five individuals have been convicted and one has been acquitted in the case related to a meningitis outbreak that occurred in 2012. The outbreak, which sickened nearly 800 people and resulted in the deaths of at least 64 individuals, was attributed to contaminated injections of medical steroids produced by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Massachusetts. The defendants were among 14 people charged in 2014 following an investigation into the outbreak.

The workers convicted in this case were not accused of producing or sending the contaminated injections that caused the outbreak. Instead, they were charged with sending and approving other contaminated and substandard drugs. Prosecutors argued that the NECC made drugs in unsanitary conditions, sent untested products, and deceived regulators. They claimed that the defendants disregarded patient health and prioritized profits over safety.

Among those found guilty was Gregory Conigliaro, a part owner of the NECC, who was charged with conspiring to defraud the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pharmacist Gene Svirskiy was the only defendant convicted of the most serious charge of racketeering. Other defendants, including pharmacist Christopher Leary, were acquitted of some counts but convicted of others.

Pharmacist Joseph Evanosky, who worked in the NECC's clean rooms where the drugs were made, was acquitted of all charges. His attorney stated that Evanosky was an innocent man who should never have been charged.

So far, a total of 11 people charged in the meningitis outbreak investigation have been convicted. Two other pharmacists are scheduled to go to trial next year. In a previous trial, supervisory pharmacist Glenn Chin was sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of racketeering and mail fraud. Co-owner Barry Cadden is currently serving a nine-year prison term for his role in the outbreak.

The article notes that the death toll from the outbreak has now surpassed 100, according to federal prosecutors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had previously reported 64 deaths as of October 2013.

1134,"### Context: Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love has revealed in an essay for the Players' Tribune that he has been dealing with mental health issues, including panic attacks. Love, a five-time All-Star, said that he had a panic attack during a game against the Atlanta Hawks on November 5th. He described feeling his heart racing and being unable to catch his breath during a timeout in the third quarter. Love was taken to the Cleveland Clinic for tests, but nothing abnormal was found. He returned to playing at a high level but was burdened by the fear of people finding out about his struggles. Love also mentioned leaving a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 20th under similar circumstances, which led to a heated team meeting. Love's father, Stan, who also played in the NBA, had always struggled with the stigma attached to showing weakness, and Love himself had followed the same playbook of not talking about his feelings. The Cavs encouraged Love to see a therapist, and he now receives counseling a few times a month when the team is at home. Love drew courage to go public with his issues after Toronto Raptors All-Star DeMar DeRozan recently acknowledged his own battles with depression. Love believes that creating a better environment for talking about mental health is crucial. His revelations received praise from teammate LeBron James, who tweeted his support. Love ended his essay by encouraging anyone struggling with mental health issues to seek help and reminding them that sharing their struggles is not weird or different, but rather an important step towards healing.

1135,"### Context: The article discusses the death of Daniel Best, the Trump administration's senior adviser on drug pricing reform. Best was found ""unresponsive"" near the garage door exit of a Washington, D.C., apartment building and was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of his death was initially not disclosed, but two weeks later, the office of Washington, D.C.'s chief medical examiner announced that Best had died of ""multiple blunt force injuries"" and ruled it as a suicide.

However, internet conspiracy theorists questioned this ruling, suggesting that Best may have been the victim of foul play. They pointed to the pharmaceutical industry's objections to Best's efforts to lower prescription drug costs, President Trump's announcement of a plan to reduce Medicare drug prices, and the fact that Best died of blunt force injuries. Far-right conspiracist websites also questioned the ruling, sarcastically asking how someone could kill themselves by repeatedly hitting themselves with a blunt object.

The article then explains that the assumption that blunt force injuries can only be sustained in a physical attack is fallacious. Forensic pathologists define a blunt force injury as any injury resulting from impact with a blunt object, which can include hammers, baseball bats, fists, and even the interior surfaces of vehicles, among other things. Blunt force injuries can occur in various scenarios, including transportation fatalities, falls from heights, blast injuries, and being struck by objects.

The article concludes by stating that a ruling of suicide is possible if Best sustained self-inflicted blunt force injuries, depending on the circumstances. It quotes Thomas Sporn, M.D., Chief of the Section of Pulmonary and Thoracic Pathology at Duke University Medical Center, who explains that jumping off a building and striking the pavement or darting into traffic could result in blunt force injuries.

In summary, the article discusses the controversy surrounding the death of Daniel Best, who was found dead with multiple blunt force injuries. While the official ruling was suicide, conspiracy theorists and far-right websites questioned this conclusion, suggesting foul play due to Best's role in drug pricing reform. The article clarifies that blunt force injuries can be self-inflicted and occur in various scenarios, supporting the possibility of suicide.

1136,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell that the stimulus package includes ""$219,000 to study the sex lives of female college freshmen."" The article examines this claim and provides more information about the study in question.

The article starts by mentioning President Barack Obama's address on the anniversary of the economic stimulus, where he boasted that there have been no reports of money being misspent. However, McConnell released a press release listing 15 stimulus projects that he believes are wasteful, including the study on the sex lives of female college freshmen.

The article then looks at the study itself, which involves 500 Syracuse University freshmen divulging details of their sex lives as part of a women's health study. The study aims to understand the health consequences of casual sexual encounters and the impact on mental and physical health. It is funded through the Department of Health and Human Services and will track various health-related behaviors and symptoms.

The article clarifies that the study is not a submission to Penthouse but rather a public health study aimed at improving approaches to intervention in women's health. The study's lead researcher, Syracuse University professor Michael Carey, defends the study as important for addressing the health threats faced by women, such as sexually transmitted diseases and eating disorders.

The article concludes by stating that while McConnell's characterization of the study may be politically charged, the actual study is a public health research project. It also mentions that the study will only employ a half-time research assistant and part-time temporary assistants, so the number of direct jobs created will be limited.

In summary, the article addresses the claim that the stimulus package includes ""$219,000 to study the sex lives of female college freshmen."" It provides information about the study, clarifying that it is a public health research project aimed at understanding the health consequences of casual sexual encounters. The article also highlights the defense of the study by its lead researcher and concludes that the claim is not as sensationalized as it may seem.

1137,"### Context: The article discusses a study comparing the effectiveness of over-the-counter (OTC) personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) to conventional hearing aids. The cost of the prescription hearing aid used in the study is mentioned as $1,910, while the PSAPs tested ranged in cost from $30 to $350. The study found that hearing aids alone improved speech recognition by 12 percent, while the three most expensive PSAPs (over $300) improved speech recognition by at least 10 percent. However, the least expensive PSAP ($30) actually worsened speech recognition by 11 percent.

The article points out that the news release should have mentioned the potential harms of PSAPs compared to hearing aids. Cheaper PSAPs may not selectively amplify speech, which could potentially worsen hearing loss by amplifying too loud and broad a range of sound. The article also highlights that the study had a small sample size of 42 participants, which may not be representative of the millions of people who struggle with hearing loss. Additionally, the tests were conducted in a simulated, controlled setting with professional assistance, which may not reflect real-world usage where people may not correctly set up or wear a PSAP.

The release is commended for providing information about the availability of both hearing aids through licensed professionals and PSAPs over-the-counter. However, it is noted that comparing alternatives in highly controlled settings may not accurately reflect real-life situations.

Overall, the article suggests that the study's findings comparing PSAPs to hearing aids are surprising and worthy of attention, despite the limitations of the small sample size and controlled methodology. The article does not detect any exaggerated or hyped language in the release.

The finding: Many personal sound amplification products, or PSAPs, which can be purchased over-the-counter, seem to perform nearly as well as much more expensive, medically prescribed hearing aids when it comes to understanding speech. While the release does discuss and compare costs — a frequently overlooked yet crucial issue, as we often bemoan here at HealthNewsReview.org — it whiffed on quantifying the benefits of using cheaper devices and discussing their harms. Hearing loss affects some 48 million Americans, but Medicare doesn’t cover hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars per ear — this despite the fact that people 65 and older are affected by hearing loss. If over-the-counter devices like PSAPs compare to the aid provided by much more expensive prescription hearing aids, then millions more people with hearing loss may be able to reap the benefits.","Certain OTC, Less Expensive Hearing Aids Provide Benefit Similar to Conventional Hearing Aid","This news release describes a study that compared the effectiveness of three over-the-counter personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) to a conventional hearing aid.

1139,"### Context: In August 2019, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a raid at the Mississippi chicken plant owned by Koch Foods, resulting in the detention of 680 undocumented immigrants. The raid was described as the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in US history. While it is unclear how the immigration status of the detained individuals was determined, it was reported that Latino workers were gathered into one room by ICE agents. Approximately 300 of the detained individuals were released within a day.

Koch Foods, a large poultry processor based in Park Ridge, Illinois, had about a quarter of the arrested workers employed at its Mississippi plant. The raid on Koch Foods was part of a larger operation that targeted seven food processing plants owned by four companies. The raids were carried out due to suspicions of the companies ""willfully and unlawfully employing"" undocumented workers.

The claim that Koch Foods had previously been ordered to pay a settlement is also true. In 2018, Koch Foods settled a class employment discrimination lawsuit filed by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The lawsuit alleged sexual harassment, national origin and race discrimination, as well as retaliation against Hispanic workers at Koch's chicken processing plant in Morton, Mississippi. Koch Foods agreed to pay $3.75 million in monetary relief to the victims and implement measures to prevent future discrimination.

Therefore, the claim that Koch Foods, the chicken plant raided by ICE in August 2019, was previously ordered to pay a settlement is accurate. The company settled a discrimination lawsuit in 2018 and was targeted in the ICE raid due to suspicions of employing undocumented workers.

1140,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Republican nominee Dan Patrick against his Democratic opponent Leticia Van de Putte regarding a vote she made in 2003. Patrick claimed that Van de Putte voted to give illegal immigrants in Texas free health care. The article examines the accuracy of this claim.

According to Patrick's spokesman, the vote in question was for Senate Bill 309, which required local hospitals to provide emergency care to patients regardless of their immigration status. Opponents of the bill argued that it would increase healthcare costs and taxes for providing care to illegal immigrants. Patrick's spokesman argued that Van de Putte supported this measure knowing that it would benefit illegal immigrants at the expense of taxpayers.

The article then provides background information on the legislation. The bill, which was approved by voice vote in 2003, allowed cities, counties, and public hospitals to use local funds to provide health care services to individuals regardless of their immigration status. The legislation aimed to provide preventive services to residents and reduce the need for costly emergency room visits.

The article also mentions that federal law already required hospitals to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. The legislation in question focused on non-emergency services and left the funding and delivery of services up to local governments. The Senate version of the law also included a cost-sharing system for patients.

In conclusion, the article states that Patrick's claim that Van de Putte voted to give illegal immigrants free health care is not accurate. The 2003 legislation did not provide immigrants with free across-the-board health care. Instead, it allowed local governments to provide non-emergency services to residents regardless of their immigration status, with patients sharing the costs. The legislation aimed to improve outcomes and reduce costly emergency care, which all residents were already entitled to under federal law.

1142,"### Context: The claim that an image shows reported cases of ""flesh eating bacteria"" in 2019 is misleading. The image in question is a map that has been circulating since 2010 and was originally associated with the British Petroleum (BP) oil spill. The map does not accurately represent the number of reported cases of flesh-eating bacteria in 2019.

While it is true that some counties in Florida have seen an increase in cases of an illness mislabeled as ""flesh-eating disease,"" public health officials attribute these infections to water pollution. The bacteria responsible for these infections, Vibrio vulnificus, can cause severe symptoms such as chills, fever, swelling, blistering, skin lesions, severe pain, low blood pressure, and discharge from wounds. Without treatment, it can be fatal. Since 2008, Vibrio vulnificus has infected 346 people in Florida, resulting in 99 deaths.

However, officials emphasize that the risk of infection remains extremely rare for most people. The chance of getting a Vibrio infection is about the same as getting struck by lightning. Environmental advocates are concerned that water pollution could increase the risk of infection.

The Facebook map that circulated in 2019 indicated numerous cases of the illness along the coasts of Florida, across to Texas, and including Louisiana. However, the actual number of reported cases in 2019 was much lower. Seven cases were reported in the Gulf of Mexico, where flesh-eating bacteria, particularly the Vibrio species, thrive due to the warm waters. These cases included a man fishing in Florida, a 12-year-old girl on vacation in Florida, and a 77-year-old woman who died after walking along a beach in Florida. After the Fourth of July weekend, five more cases were reported, including a man in Florida, a woman in California, and two men who died from necrotizing fasciitis in Florida and Texas.

In conclusion, the image circulating on Facebook claiming to show reported cases of flesh-eating bacteria in 2019 is misleading. The map is from 2010 and was associated with the BP oil spill. While there have been cases of Vibrio vulnificus infections in Florida and other areas, the risk of infection remains extremely rare for most people.

1143,"### Context: The article discusses the upcoming change in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) that will eliminate the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome and include it under the broader category of autism spectrum disorder. The change has caused concerns among some families, as they worry that individuals who were previously diagnosed with Asperger's may no longer meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder and therefore have difficulty accessing services. However, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) task force recommends that individuals already diagnosed with an autism-related disorder, such as Asperger's, would be grandfathered in to ensure they continue to receive services and insurance coverage.

The article features the story of Matthew, a boy diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Matthew's mother, Kolen, describes him as a genuinely happy kid who loves nature and paleontology. She believes that Matthew's diagnosis does not define him and is not concerned about the change in the DSM. Matthew is currently receiving treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has developed some anxiety issues, which are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorders.

Matthew attends a social group with other young people on the autism spectrum to work on improving their social skills. While he struggles with conversation and tends to dominate, Kolen believes that with enough practice, he will learn to respond appropriately to social cues. Her goal is to ensure that Matthew can work, earn a living, and support himself doing what he loves.

The article also mentions an analysis by Dr. Fred Volkmar of the Yale School of Medicine, which suggests that as many as 45 percent of those currently diagnosed with autism or a related disorder may no longer qualify under the new definition in the DSM-5. However, Dr. Elizabeth Laugeson, an autism researcher at the University of California Los Angeles, points out that Volkmar's analysis was based on older medical records that may not have captured all the symptoms that would qualify a person for an autism diagnosis under the new standard. The impact of the change in routine practice is still uncertain, and it remains to be seen how it will affect individuals seeking services and insurance coverage.

Overall, the article highlights the concerns and perspectives of families affected by the change in the DSM-5 regarding the elimination of the Asperger's diagnosis. It also emphasizes the importance of providing support and services to individuals on the autism spectrum, regardless of the specific label or diagnosis.

However, it was later reported that Perry did not meet the woman, Heather Burcham, until after he had issued the order. ABC News stated that Perry met Burcham while she was lobbying the Texas legislature to uphold the governor's executive order, but the legislature ultimately ruled against the mandate. Perry and Burcham developed a friendship, and he invited her to his ranch, rode motorcycles with her, and sat at her bedside during her final days. Burcham died in July 2007. Perry's YouTube posts include a video of Burcham advocating for the HPV vaccine at a press conference.

1146,"### Context: The claim that an inaudible sonic weapon adequately explains the range of symptoms experienced by diplomats suffering from ""health attacks"" in Cuba is false, according to an analysis of scientific research. The symptoms reported by the victims include hearing loss, fatigue, headaches, ringing ears, vertigo, nausea, concentration and memory problems, and mild traumatic brain injury. The analysis finds that neither infrasound (low-frequency, high-power noise) nor ultrasound (high-frequency sound) can explain all of these symptoms. While some studies suggest a connection between infrasound and nausea, there is no scientific consensus on the other symptoms. Similarly, ultrasound is unlikely to cause the reported symptoms, as the waves dissipate rapidly through the air and cannot penetrate the body without direct contact. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that noise of any kind can cause blood disorders. The analysis concludes that no single brand of sound could create the range of symptoms described by the victims, and even if it could, a covert device would be hard to design. However, the New York Times reported that the government is considering a theory that focused beams of microwave energy could be responsible for the health attacks. This theory is based on the Frey effect or the microwave auditory effect, which suggests that microwave pulses can cause both brain damage and the perception of noises. The weaponization of this technology has been of interest to the United States and the former Soviet Union. The Cuban government has pushed back against this theory, suggesting that it belongs in the realm of science fiction and is inconsistent with the reported circumstances described by the victims.

1147,"### Context: The claim that Mississippi has passed a bill granting churchgoers the right to shoot and kill citizens at will is not entirely accurate. The bill in question, known as the Mississippi Church Protection Act, does allow for the creation of security programs in churches and places of worship. These programs can designate and train members to carry concealed weapons for the protection of the congregation. The bill also provides criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.

The bill does not specifically grant churchgoers the right to shoot and kill citizens at will. It establishes a legally codified way of assembling security details, with the participation of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, who may possess concealed weapons in places that were previously off-limits to concealed carry, such as churches. The bill states that killing a person while acting as a participant of a church or place of worship security team is justifiable homicide, but this only applies to trained security team members acting under the direction of church officials.

The bill aims to provide small churches and other houses of worship with an extra option for security, particularly in response to incidents like the Charleston church shooting in 2015. It does not grant absolute legal immunity from prosecution for killing anyone during church services. Any person seeking legal protection from criminal prosecution for involvement in a fatal shooting committed during church services would still be subject to arrest and trial, with the hope that a jury would agree their actions were justifiable.

In summary, the Mississippi Church Protection Act allows for the creation of security programs in churches and places of worship, with designated and trained members carrying concealed weapons. The bill does not grant churchgoers the right to shoot and kill citizens at will, but rather establishes guidelines for security measures and provides legal protections for those serving as church security.

1148,"### Context: The claim that a nurse in Zambia swapped nearly 5,000 babies at birth and gave them to the wrong parents is not supported by evidence. The article states that a nurse suffering from terminal cancer made a confession on her sickbed, admitting to swapping babies for fun during her time working at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka from 1983 to 1995. However, many readers dismissed the article as a joke due to the implausibility of the claim. The rate of one baby swapped per day for thirteen years without any parents raising concerns seemed highly unlikely.

Local officials took the report seriously enough to conduct an investigation, but they found no nurse matching the name mentioned in the article. The General Nursing Council of Zambia confirmed that there was no midwife named Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa in their register, and no midwife with that name had ever worked in the maternity ward at UTH. The investigation aimed to verify the authenticity of the report, and stakeholders were urged to remain calm as the investigation continued.

The Zambian Observer, the source of the original article, later reported on the debunking of their own story. The article also mentions that the same photograph of nurse Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa was used by the website to accompany an article about a mistaken swap of newborn babies at a different hospital in Zambia. This photograph had previously appeared on the blog of Ma Sedaye, a Zimbabwean woman living in Columbus, Ohio.

In summary, the claim that a nurse in Zambia swapped nearly 5,000 babies at birth and gave them to the wrong parents is not supported by evidence. The investigation conducted by local officials found no evidence of a nurse named Elizabeth Bwalya Mwewa working at UTH, and the source of the original article has been deemed unreliable.

1149,"### Context: The article discusses a claim made by Russ Feingold, a Democrat running for Senate in Wisconsin, about his opponent, Ron Johnson. Feingold claimed that Johnson said he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the Veterans Administration (VA). The article confirms that Johnson has advocated for privatizing certain aspects of the VA, such as allowing veterans to receive medical care outside of the VA system. However, Johnson has not called for replacing the public system with a completely private one.

The article also provides background information on the VA scandals that have occurred nationally and in Wisconsin. In May 2014, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned following allegations that 40 patients died while awaiting care at a Phoenix VA hospital. It was discovered that VA employees had lied about patient wait times to take advantage of a program that incentivized scheduling appointments within 14 days. In January 2015, it was revealed that doctors at the VA medical center in Tomah, Wisconsin, had been overprescribing narcotic painkillers. This led to scrutiny and arrests of individuals involved in illegal drug sales at the facility.

Regarding Johnson's position on the VA, the article states that he has pressed for turning to the private sector for some aspects of care. He voted against legislation aimed at easing scheduling problems at VA facilities by allowing the VA to contract with private medical facilities. Johnson preferred a bill that would have given veterans the ability to receive treatment outside the VA system, not just from private facilities the VA might contract with. He has expressed a desire to move towards a more privatized system but has also left the door open to making changes that would stop short of a completely private system.

In conclusion, the article confirms that Johnson has advocated for privatizing elements of the VA but has not called for a complete privatization of the system. Feingold's claim that Johnson hopes for the first steps to privatize the VA is rated as true.

1150,"### Context: A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal has found that spanking children can cause long-term harm. The study examined 20 years of published research on the issue and concluded that physical punishment makes children more aggressive and antisocial, can cause cognitive impairment and developmental difficulties, and may reduce the brain's grey matter in areas relevant to intelligence testing. The authors of the study argue that the medical findings have been largely overlooked and overshadowed by concerns about parental rights. While spanking is less common than it was 20 years ago, many still support the practice and see prohibiting spanking as limiting parental rights. The authors emphasize that there is no controversy in the research, as there are no studies showing any long-term positive outcomes from physical punishment. They argue that if there were this level of consistency in findings in any other area of health, action would be taken. The study's authors hope that physicians will counsel parents more on this issue and help them understand that physical punishment is not effective. They also hope that countries that allow the practice, including Canada, will reconsider their child protection laws. Canada has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which includes a passage stating that countries must protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence. The authors argue that if there were two or three studies showing that taking 500 mg of vitamin C a day could reduce cancer risk, everyone would be taking it. However, there are more than 80 studies showing the same thing about corporal punishment, yet it is still considered controversial.

1151,"### Context: The claim that Dr. Leon Eisenberg, the 'father' of ADHD, said that ADHD is a fictitious disease is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Dr. Eisenberg made a statement about ADHD before his death, the context of his statement suggests a different meaning. In an interview with Der Spiegel, Dr. Eisenberg expressed concern about the overdiagnosis and overprescription of ADHD medication. He stated that the genetic predisposition to ADHD is overrated and that child psychiatrists should focus more on determining the psychosocial reasons behind behavioral problems. He criticized the quick prescription of pills without thoroughly examining the underlying issues. 

Dr. Eisenberg's contribution to the field of child psychiatry was significant. He conducted groundbreaking research on childhood developmental problems, including some of the first rigorous studies on autism and attention deficit disorder. He advocated for research into developmental problems and introduced a bio-psycho-social model at a time when psychoanalytical thinking was dominant. Although he is not necessarily the 'inventor' or 'father' of ADHD, he contributed greatly to the knowledge and understanding of the disorder.

The article also mentions another interview with Harvard psychologist Dr. Jerome Kagan, who criticized the overdiagnosis of mental disorders in children and referred to ADHD as an invention. Dr. Kagan argued that many children who are not doing well in school are labeled as having ADHD and prescribed medication without proper evaluation.

In summary, while Dr. Eisenberg did express concerns about the overdiagnosis and overprescription of ADHD medication, he did not outright claim that ADHD is a fictitious disease. His statement emphasized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the psychosocial factors contributing to behavioral problems in children.

1152,"### Context: President Donald Trump has been spreading a false claim that COVID-19 is not as deadly as reported by public health agencies. He retweeted a now-deleted post alleging that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had quietly updated the number of coronavirus deaths. He also shared a tweet from a senior legal adviser for his reelection campaign that linked to an article claiming that only 9,210 Americans died from COVID-19 alone. In an interview with Fox News, Trump mentioned a statistic that only 6% of people actually died from COVID-19, implying that the rest died from other causes.

The claim made by Trump is based on a report from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the CDC. The report states that for 6% of deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned, while for the rest, there were additional conditions or causes. This information has led to claims on social media, including those retweeted by Trump, suggesting that the CDC adjusted its coronavirus death counts and that the disease is not as deadly as previously thought. However, fact-checkers have debunked these claims.

The report's mention of comorbidities refers to conditions that patients experience alongside COVID-19. The CDC has stated that conditions like cancer or diabetes put people at a higher risk of death if they contract the virus. The NCHS report shows that the majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities. However, this does not mean that COVID-19 was not a significant factor in their deaths. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, clarified that even if someone with hypertension or diabetes dies of COVID-19, they did die from the virus.

The reason why 94% of death certificates mentioning COVID-19 also list other conditions is that when a coronavirus patient is admitted to the hospital, their medical record includes the virus as well as any other conditions they may have. For example, if a patient develops respiratory failure due to the virus and later dies from cardiac arrest, both conditions would be listed on their record. The underlying cause of death, however, is considered to be COVID-19.

In conclusion, Trump's claim that only 6% of people died from COVID-19 is inaccurate and misleading. The CDC data shows that 185,092 Americans had died due to COVID-19 as of September 3, and comorbidities are common among coronavirus-related deaths. The claim that the CDC adjusted its death counts is false, and the underlying cause of death for the majority of cases is COVID-19.

1153,"### Context: The article discusses a recent discovery that could potentially lead to a shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, the article criticizes the lack of information regarding the cost of the treatment, despite a quote from the study's leader mentioning potential cost savings. The release mentions that the treatment will be a ""Gleevec-like"" drug, which is notable because the cost of Gleevec has increased significantly over the years. The introduction of generics after the patent on Gleevec expires is expected to bring the cost down. The article also highlights the lack of information regarding the side effects of the treatment, which is a major oversight considering the need for alternatives to drugs like Gleevec. The release mentions that the research was performed in animal subjects, and it remains to be seen if the treatment would have similar benefits for humans. The article emphasizes the importance of disclosing potential side effects and notes that all cancer drugs have them. The release mentions that a phase 1 clinical trial for the potential treatment has been opened at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's hospital and is being funded by an NIH grant and Hyundai Hope on Wheels. It also mentions that one of the authors on the study is an employee of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, which owns the patent for Gleevec. The release vaguely references ""second- and third-line targeted therapies"" that can return the disease to remission but does not provide specific names. The release implies that imatinib-like drugs are the standard of care for CML patients, but it does not clarify if the potential Ezh2 inhibitor drug is readily available. The article concludes by criticizing the repeated use of the term ""cure"" in the release, as it is based on preliminary animal data and may not translate to humans.
Claim: Discovery offers prospect of shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This news release by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is a teaser on a potential new drug target for sufferers of a blood cancer called chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CML, which affects 30,000 Americans a year. The release spends a good amount of space explaining the condition and problems with a standard treatment — a drug called Gleevec (a brand-name version of the drug imatinib) — and how up to 90% of patients with the disease face a lifetime of medication that may eventually stop working. It also does a nice job explaining a biological pathway that helps drive CML and why it might be a mechanism to target in the future, specifically Ezh2 inhibitors. However, the study was done in mice — not people. The release belatedly points this out in the final third of the text — but we would have liked to see it more prominently mentioned. The reason: The relevance may not transfer to people with CML. That’s also why we think the repeated use of the word “cure” and the possibility of shorter treatment in the headline is overstating and misleading. One glaring omission was that of price. The only allusion to price in the news release is an aside in the closing line noting shorter treatment times translate into cost savings. We’re also given no rough treatment cost estimates for an unnamed Ezh2 inhibitor made by Epizyme that’s mentioned in the release. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) develops in bone marrow and affects myeloid cells. Those cells typically mature into platelets or red blood cells, but genetic and other abnormalities can lead them to mature into defunct granulocyte cells, i.e. leukemia. CML patients experience a gradual though sometimes rapid build-up of leukemia in their bones and then in their spleen, crowding out healthy cells over time. This drives symptoms that may include frequent infections (due to immune system weakening), fatigue (fewer red blood cells), and easy bleeding (fewer platelets). CML affects about 30,000 people each year and about 1.2 million to 1.5 million people worldwide, most of them middle-aged adults (though there are a few children). While patients who seek the standard of treatment — imatinib (marketed as Gleevec and Glivec) — receive it “indefinitely,” the median survival is between 5-6 years, since leukemia cells can build up resistance to imatinib-like drugs. In fact, about 80-90% of patients can’t clear all of their leukemia cells and stay on permanent drugs. By increasing the number of CML patients who can drive their cancer into remission, suffering could be dramatically reduced — as would the cost of their treatment. As teased by this release, Ezh2 inhibitors may (or may not) help CML patients. Clinical trials would have to determine if that hypothesis pans out.",Discovery offers prospect of shorter treatment and cure for chronic myelogenous leukemia,"This news release from Boston Children’s Hospital describes a preliminary study of a new drug that may be able to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) more effectively than the current standard of care, a drug called imatinib (brand name Gleevec). The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it falls short in several areas. It doesn’t mention costs, which are significant for Gleevec, and it doesn’t provide any quantitative data from the study. It also doesn’t mention harms, which are a concern given that the new drug is still in the early stages of development. The release also uses the word “cure” in the headline and lead paragraph, which is a bit of an overstatement given that the study was conducted in mice. The release would have been improved had it used more cautious language. CML is a type of leukemia that is characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. It is a slow-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The current standard of care for CML is a drug called imatinib (brand name Gleevel), which is a targeted therapy that blocks the enzyme tyrosine kinase. The drug is very effective in treating CML, but it can cause side effects such as muscle cramps, swelling of the hands and feet, and fluid retention. The drug also has potentially serious side effects such as heart failure and liver problems. A new drug that is more effective and has fewer side effects would be a welcome addition to the treatment of CML."

The article refutes this claim by providing important information about the flu vaccine and its effectiveness.

The article explains that the flu season in Santa Barbara County has been particularly severe, with eight deaths in just two weeks. The strain of flu responsible for this outbreak, H3N2, is resistant to vaccination. The flu vaccine has been effective in knocking out this strain only 32% of the time, according to the Center for Disease Control. Studies from Australia suggest that the vaccine's effectiveness against H3N2 may be as low as 10%.

However, the article emphasizes that even in an ineffective year, the flu vaccine can still provide benefits. It can save lives, reduce hospital visits and deaths, and prevent flu-related deaths in children. The article cites a professor of pediatrics who argues that even if the absolute risk reduction is low, the benefits of getting the flu shot outweigh the harms.

The article also addresses the claim that the flu vaccine can make individuals more susceptible to the flu and other viruses in the following years. It mentions a small-scale study that found an increased risk of non-influenza infections among flu shot recipients. However, no other studies have replicated this result, and larger-scale studies have found no evidence to support this claim.

In conclusion, the article refutes the claim made by Erin Elizabeth that the deaths of eight vaccinated individuals from the flu prove that people should not get the flu shot. It explains that the severity of the flu season and the resistance of the H3N2 strain to vaccination are factors contributing to the outbreak. Despite the variable effectiveness of the flu vaccine, it is still recommended by doctors and scientists due to its potential benefits in preventing the flu and reducing its impact. The claim that the flu vaccine increases susceptibility to the flu and other viruses is not supported by credible evidence.

1155,"### Context: Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of the French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP), has been arrested along with another executive from the company. The arrests come two years after the scandal surrounding PIP implants made headlines worldwide. The detention could lead to Mas being placed under formal investigation for manslaughter and causing bodily harm. Women who have been campaigning against PIP welcomed the arrests, as they feel that justice is finally being served. French authorities have been criticized for being slow to react to the case, which has caused fear among thousands of women who have PIP implants. The implants were banned in France in 2010 due to concerns over their quality, but it was only last month that officials recommended their surgical removal. PIP was once the third largest global supplier of breast implants. Lawyers for women in France who have filed complaints against PIP welcomed the arrests and said that there must be no escaping justice for Mas. PIP enjoyed success with international sales, but it was later revealed that the company was using cheap, industrial silicone that was not approved for medical use. The implants have been reported to have abnormally high rupture rates. The arrests follow an investigation opened in Marseille in December after the death of a woman with PIP implants. Mas and the other executive can be held for up to 48 hours while a judge decides whether to open a formal probe. A trial date could be years away, but the manslaughter case could make it harder for Mas to avoid appearing in court on other charges of fraud and deception. PIP closed down in 2010 after it was discovered that the company was using non-approved silicone gel. Last month, the French government advised women with PIP implants to have them removed and said it would pay for the operations in France. France has called for tighter regulations on medical devices in the European Union in the wake of the PIP affair.

1156,"### Context: A quarter of the passengers on the British cruise ship Balmoral have fallen ill with norovirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The ship, operated by Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, left Southampton, England on April 16 for a 34-day cruise, making stops in Portugal and Bermuda before arriving in Norfolk, Virginia. At that time, CDC officials reported that 153 passengers and six crew members had been infected with norovirus. The ship then stopped in Baltimore, Maryland, where health officials and an epidemiologist boarded to assess the outbreak and response. Specimens collected on board tested positive for norovirus and were sent to the CDC for additional testing.

Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines stated that a ""gastro-enteritis type illness"" had affected a number of guests, with seven cases in isolation at that point. The majority of passengers on board were from the United Kingdom, with two U.S. nationals also present. Witnesses reported seeing constant cleaning of surfaces when the ship docked in Portland, Maine. The ship was scheduled to stop in St. John, New Brunswick, Canada on Monday.

The CDC confirmed that the cruise line had taken actions in response to the outbreak, including increasing cleaning and disinfection procedures, collecting stool specimens, and daily reporting of illness. Public health and sanitation managers were also dispatched to oversee and assist with sanitation and outbreak response. The Balmoral has a capacity for 1,350 passengers and is the largest and newest ship in the cruise line's fleet.

In summary, a quarter of the passengers on the Balmoral cruise ship have been affected by norovirus. The ship has taken measures to address the outbreak, including increased cleaning and disinfection procedures, and the CDC is conducting additional testing on collected specimens.

1157,"### Context: The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is organizing a six-day ""Citizens Academy"" training program in Chicago in September 2020. The program aims to engage civilians with ICE officers and provide them with an understanding of ICE policies and procedures. The curriculum includes classroom instruction, visits to immigration detention centers, and discussions on healthcare provided to those in custody. The program also covers ICE's role in ensuring dignity, respect, and due process in immigration cases. The training will involve scenario-based exercises, including defensive tactics, firearms familiarization, and targeted arrests.

ICE clarified that the purpose of the academy is not to train civilians to perform the work of trained federal law enforcement officers. The program is modeled after other law enforcement community outreach programs and aims to directly engage and educate the public. ICE is seeking a diverse set of influential community leaders to participate, regardless of their stance on ICE.

Similar Citizens Academy programs have been conducted in Los Angeles for years, where participants simulate drug busts, arrests, and stakeouts. The goal of these programs is to help people understand ICE's perspective, observe their operations, and create a positive image of the agency in various communities. However, there is no evidence to suggest that civilians who participate in these trainings are involved in actual arrests.

The article highlights concerns raised by immigration advocates regarding the potential implications of the Citizens Academy training. While ICE maintains that the program is solely for educational purposes, advocates remain skeptical. The article also mentions that ICE has not yet determined whether media will be allowed to attend the training due to health precautions and privacy concerns related to the pandemic.

In summary, ICE is planning a six-day Citizens Academy training program in Chicago, which will provide civilians with an understanding of ICE policies and procedures. The program includes instruction on firearms and scenario-based exercises but does not aim to train civilians to perform arrests. Similar programs have been conducted in Los Angeles, but there is no evidence of civilians participating in actual arrests.

1158,"### Context: The article explores the claim made by Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, that the problems with forest fires in America are due to bad policy put in place by environmentalists. The article examines the role of environmentalists and environmental policies in relation to wildfires.

The article highlights that there are multiple causes of wildfires in the United States, including extensive drought and vast amounts of combustible material. It is difficult to determine the exact role of environmental activists and policies in causing large fires. While environmental regulations and legal challenges by environmental activists can delay the work of the Forest Service, it is unclear if these delays have played a major role in the large fires experienced in the country.

The article mentions that environmental rules and lawsuits can delay and sometimes block activities on federal lands, but it is challenging to prove that without these moves, the western states would have avoided mega fires. Other factors, such as extensive drought and the accumulation of combustible material in forests, play a more prominent role in the occurrence of large fires.

The article also discusses the historical approach to fire suppression, which has contributed to the growth of combustible material in forests. In the past, fires were quickly extinguished, leading to the accumulation of undergrowth and smaller trees, which can fuel larger fires. The article suggests that the focus on fire suppression and the growth of grazing livestock have reduced naturally occurring fires and increased the risk of more intense fires.

Additionally, the article mentions the limited budget for fire prevention projects and the need for large-scale efforts to reduce the risk of mega fires. The Forest Service has borrowed money from other activities to fund fire suppression, which has hindered fire prevention efforts.

Overall, the article concludes that while environmental policies and legal challenges can impact Forest Service projects, the connection between these policies and the extreme fires of the past 15 years is uncertain. The primary factors contributing to large fires are extensive drought, the accumulation of combustible material, and limited budgets for fire prevention.
Claim: A lot of the problems with forest fires ... is because of bad policy (not to clear out the forests) that was put in place by environmentalists.
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"Perino said, ""A lot of the problems with forest fires is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists."" The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define ""a lot."" While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",A lot of the problems with forest fires ... is because of bad policy (not to clear out the forests) that was put in place by environmentalists.,"Perino said that """"a lot of the problems with forest fires ... is because of bad policy (not to clear out the forests) that was put in place by environmentalists.""""

1159,"### Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated in its seventh ""WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic"" that blocking the tobacco industry's interference is crucial in reducing the harm caused by tobacco use. The report highlights the industry's history of aggressive opposition to tobacco control measures and its goal of weakening tobacco control. The report specifically mentions tobacco giant Philip Morris International's ""Unsmoke"" campaign, which aims to position the company as a responsible public health partner. The WHO argues that this campaign is designed to ensure tobacco remains socially acceptable while confusing consumers with terms like ""smoke-free products,"" which may still have toxic emissions and unknown health effects.

Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow argues that the WHO's message makes it harder to provide safer options for people who cannot quit smoking. He emphasizes that quitting cigarettes and nicotine altogether is the best choice, but acknowledges that many people are unable to do so. He believes organizations like the WHO should listen to smokers instead of talking at them.

The WHO report also criticizes the tobacco industry for attempting to gain respectability by claiming their products are part of a ""harm reduction"" strategy, despite cigarettes still accounting for 97% of the global tobacco market. The report states that the development of new tobacco products is solely intended to expand the market for tobacco firms. Vinayak Prasad, program manager of WHO's tobacco control unit, argues that there is no difference between cigarettes and heated tobacco products except for reduced exposure and less visible smoke.

Regarding e-cigarettes, the report states that they are promoted as a way to quit smoking, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Evidence from the United States even suggests that e-cigarettes have increased the prevalence of young people smoking, making them a gateway for youth. Prasad emphasizes the need for regulation of electronic cigarettes, stating that if they are not banned, they should not be freely available in the market to prevent young people from taking them up.

Overall, the WHO report highlights the tobacco industry's tactics to undermine tobacco control measures and promote their products as safer alternatives. The report calls for stricter regulation of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to protect public health.

1160,"### Context: Last month, all Marine Corps special ops units began carrying freeze-dried plasma into the field. The plasma helps clot blood and can prevent badly wounded troops from bleeding to death on the battlefield. It saved Army Cpl. Josh Hargis' life when he lost parts of both legs in 2013. The medic in his Ranger unit used the freeze-dried plasma to keep him alive on the battlefield for more than 90 minutes until he could be evacuated by helicopter. The plasma helped stanch internal bleeding after the blast shattered Hargis' pelvis. The freeze-dried plasma is stored in a thick glass bottle and kept in a kit with IV lines and distilled water. The medic has to pour the water into the bottle, swirl it around, and inject it. The dehydrated and powdered freeze-dried version needs no refrigeration and can be used within minutes after swirling it in water. Over the past five years, the military's special ops units in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines have received about 1,000 kits of the freeze-dried plasma, including 430 this year. While specific numbers on usage are scarce, the U.S. Special Operations Command said it had been used at least 24 times by Green Berets and other special operations teams in the past five years. Of those treatments, 15 patients survived long enough to be transferred to a hospital. The U.S. military currently gets its supply from the French, whose plasma is made from volunteer donors. It has a shelf life of about two years. The U.S. is using the French product as a stopgap while Teleflex Inc. partners with the Army to win Food and Drug Administration approval by 2020. Teleflex is aiming to produce enough plasma for the armed services and civilian emergency rooms in what is projected to be a $100 million-a-year market. The granulated plasma could also be crucial in civilian emergencies, such as accidents or mass casualty events, where the supply of conventional plasma becomes depleted.

1161,"### Context: In a wide-ranging interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" President Donald Trump repeated several false and misleading claims. One of these claims was his false assertion that the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy that caused the controversial separation of families at the Southern border was ""the same as the Obama law."" However, there were some family separations under previous administrations, but there was no blanket policy to prosecute parents and separate them from their children. The Trump administration implemented a new policy in April 2018 to refer all illegal border crossings for criminal prosecution, resulting in family separations.

Trump also falsely claimed that the U.S. pays ""almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe."" In reality, the U.S. pays just over 22 percent of NATO's commonly funded budget, which is based on the gross national income of each member country. Additionally, Trump overstated the U.S. trade deficit with China, claiming that China takes ""$500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and other things."" However, the goods-and-services trade deficit with China was $351 billion for the most recent 12 months on record.

Regarding Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election, Trump repeated his unsubstantiated claim that China also meddled in the election. However, there is evidence that Russia helped Trump's election chances in multiple ways. Special counsel Robert Mueller filed an indictment against 12 members of a Russian military intelligence agency for hacking into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic National Committee, and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. WikiLeaks released Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta's emails less than an hour after a news report about Trump's comments on groping women. Additionally, three Russian organizations and 13 Russian nationals were indicted for their role in a pro-Trump social media advertising campaign.

Regarding North Korea's denuclearization, Trump claimed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it."" However, Trump and Kim have yet to come to an agreement on the terms of a denuclearization plan. Recent satellite imagery and reports indicate that North Korea is continuing to build more missiles, contradicting Trump's claim that they haven't tested a missile or built more missiles.

Overall, Trump's claims in the interview were false or misleading, particularly regarding the ""zero tolerance"" policy, NATO funding, China trade deficit, Russian interference in the election, and North Korea's denuclearization.

1163,"### Context: Country music singer Joe Diffie died on March 29 from complications related to COVID-19, according to news reports. However, a widely shared Facebook post claims, without evidence, that he died from something else. The post suggests that his death was labeled as a COVID-19 death to receive funding. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to combat misinformation.

On March 27, Joe Diffie posted a statement on his verified Facebook page confirming that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was under medical care. On March 29, a post on his Facebook page announced his death from complications of COVID-19.

Some social media posts have claimed that Diffie died of lung cancer, but his wife disputed this on Instagram, stating that he did not have lung cancer and that it was upsetting to see fake news being spread.

The article also addresses the claim that hospitals get paid more for patients with COVID-19. While it is true that Medicare pays hospitals more for patients on ventilators, and there is an additional 20% payment for COVID-19 treatment as part of a federal stimulus deal, evidence suggests that COVID-19 cases are being undercounted rather than inflated for financial gain.

In conclusion, the claim that Joe Diffie's death was labeled as a COVID-19 death when it wasn't is not supported by evidence. Diffie's official Facebook page confirmed his positive COVID-19 test and his death from complications of the virus. Claims that he died of lung cancer have been disputed by his wife. The article also addresses the misconception that hospitals inflate COVID-19 cases for financial gain, stating that evidence indicates cases are being undercounted.

1164,"### Context: The article discusses Donald Trump's changing stance on whether Barack Obama was born in the United States. Trump, who previously led a movement to prove that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore ineligible to be president, abandoned that position in a speech in Washington on September 16, 2016. He stated that Hillary Clinton and her campaign started the birther controversy, but he finished it by acknowledging that Obama was born in the United States. 

The article highlights Trump's previous statements where he falsely claimed that Obama was born in Kenya. In 2012, Trump mentioned a book publisher's claim that Obama was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia. He also referred to Obama's grandmother in Kenya saying that he was born there. However, these claims were incorrect. In a 2011 interview, Trump made the same false claim about Obama's grandmother in Kenya witnessing his birth. 

In 2015, Trump dodged a question about Obama's birthplace in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, stating that he didn't know where Obama was born and questioning why Obama wouldn't release his records. He also avoided answering the question in a December 2015 interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, stating that he didn't want to talk about it anymore. 

Even as recently as September 15, 2016, Trump refused to acknowledge Obama's birthplace when asked by the Washington Post. He stated that he would answer the question at the right time but didn't want to answer it yet. However, on September 16, 2016, Trump changed his long-held position and acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States.

However, experts have stated that there is no evidence to support this claim. The U.S. Treasury announced plans to borrow $3 trillion during the second quarter of 2020 to cover stimulus packages approved by Congress and President Donald Trump. China is the second-largest foreign holder of U.S. debt, but experts do not believe that China will be a large purchaser of the $3 trillion. The Treasury issues securities to various buyers, including the Federal Reserve System, mutual funds, financial institutions, individual investors, and central banks of other countries. The total federal debt is over $25 trillion, with about $6 trillion being intragovernmental holdings and $19 trillion being public debt. China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, but experts state that China lacks funds and there is no reason to expect its holdings of U.S. debt to increase in 2020. Most of the debt incurred to deal with the coronavirus has been purchased by the Federal Reserve, not foreign or domestic savers. China has been reducing its U.S. debt holdings in recent years due to having less foreign currency. Experts believe that the largest portion of the $3 trillion will come from U.S. institutions and American savers, with the Federal Reserve being the prime buyer. China and other emerging market governments are selling their Treasury holdings to create dollars they can use to buy their own currencies. Overall, experts state that there is no factual basis for Paul's claim and that the Federal Reserve is likely to be a major source of funds for the $3 trillion.

The device works by stimulating the sacral nerves, which control the bladder and bowel function. The InterStim is manufactured by Medtronic and has been approved by the FDA for use in the United States.

The article mentions that the cost of the device is around $20,000, but it does not provide any further information on the cost or insurance coverage. It also states that 80% of patients experienced at least a 50% improvement in symptoms with the device, but it does not compare this to the success rate of conventional treatments. The article does not provide details on what symptoms were improved or how improvement was measured.

The article mentions several potential harms of the implanted device, including re-operation due to infection and pain, mechanical failures, and discomfort. However, it does not provide any specific data on the frequency or severity of these harms.

The article refers to a review that found four randomized, controlled trials of the device. However, it does not provide details on the strength of these studies or any limitations of the current evidence. It notes that many of the studies were industry-sponsored, which could introduce bias.

The article quotes multiple experts, including one who is a researcher on a Medtronic-sponsored trial of the device. However, it does not mention any conflicts of interest for the other experts, which may raise questions about the validity of their statements.

The article mentions that exercises, biofeedback, and medications are alternative treatment options to the device and should be considered first-line options. However, it does not provide a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of these alternatives.

While the prevalence of incontinence increases with age this does not mean it is part of the normal aging process and many older adults may be unaware that it is a treatable condition. There is good quality evidence that behavior and lifestyle modification, some medications, and/or surgery can improve or resolve urinary incontinence. In 2001, the FDA approved the InterStim sacral nerve stimulation system for the treatment of urge incontinence. Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation for urge incontinence appears adequate to support the use of this procedure, however patient selection is important. The diagnosis should be defined as clearly as possible and the procedure limited to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments.

1168,"### Context: According to an article, Richmond Mayor LeVar Stoney claimed that Virginia has been lagging behind other states in terms of COVID-19 testing. The mayor based his statement on data from the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University, which showed that Virginia consistently ranked 49th or 50th in COVID-19 testing per capita in mid-April. As of April 21, Virginia was last in testing, with 738 tests conducted per 100,000 residents. In comparison, the national average was 1,168 tests per 100,000. New York, the hardest-hit state, had conducted 3,851 tests per 100,000.

The article also highlighted the controversy surrounding testing numbers and their role in the debate over when to ease stay-at-home restrictions and reopen businesses. President Donald Trump has called for lifting restrictions and has urged supporters to ""liberate"" states with Democratic governors, including Virginia. Governor Ralph Northam's stay-at-home order in Virginia is in effect until June 10, but there have been protests demanding the state to reopen. Northam has appointed a work group to increase testing capacity, stating that the ability to conduct large numbers of tests is crucial for lifting restrictions.

The article mentioned that Virginia has faced challenges in competing with other states for testing supplies. The state has been searching for equipment to increase testing but has been unsuccessful due to a national shortage. The Northam administration also cited reasons unique to Virginia, such as a slow start in testing because no hospitals or labs in the state initially developed their own tests. This led to a reliance on the state lab, which had limited testing to the most vulnerable patients. However, Virginia has made improvements by allowing private labs, universities, and hospitals to develop their own tests. The total number of tests conducted in Virginia has quadrupled during the first three weeks of April.

In conclusion, the article confirms Mayor Stoney's claim that Virginia has lagged behind other states in COVID-19 testing. The state has consistently ranked at the bottom in per capita testing, and there have been challenges in obtaining testing supplies. However, efforts are being made to increase testing capacity in Virginia.

1169,"### Context: The statement gave no reason for their removal, but said forests would be managed under the office of the prime minister for the time being. Bongo had promised to punish anyone implicated in the disappearance of a cache of 392 containers of the wood, which were seized at the port of Owendo in late February and early March. Two Chinese nationals are being held in relation to the case, and last week the head of customs Dieudonne Lewamouo was detained. Gabonese authorities said last month that they had recovered 200 containers. Illegal logging is ravaging the forests of West and equatorial Africa, most of it driven by Chinese demand, but rarely do governments take action against suspected culprits. Since taking over from his father in 2009 - continuing a family dynasty that has exceeded five decades - Ali Ben Bongo has cast himself as an environmental crusader. He has delighted conservation groups by banning raw wood exports, expanding protected zones and creating 13 new national parks. Despite those efforts Gabon remains a hub for poaching, illegal logging and the illicit wildlife trade. Bongo suffered a stroke last October while abroad, but returned home in March. Secrecy surrounding the state of Bongo’s health during his five-month absence has fueled instability in Gabon, where declining oil revenues and widespread poverty have dented his popularity.

1170,"### Context: One of the primary issues that the U.S. federal and state governments were wrestling with during the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic in May 2020 was the trade-off of keeping social distancing and business closure restrictions in place to protect lives, versus the trade-off of ongoing (and possibly permanent) economic harm to individuals, businesses, and the country as a whole. On May 5, 2020, while U.S. President Donald Trump was in Phoenix, Arizona, to tour a medical face mask manufacturing facility there, he was interviewed by David Muir of ABC News about the subject of reopening the U.S.:   Shortly after the interview aired, a meme began to circulate on social media holding that when Trump had been asked during that interview what he’d say to people who lost family members to COVID-19, he replied, “I would say this didn’t hurt anyone as much as it hurt me”:  Although this meme is vaguely reflective of something Trump said during that interview, it grossly misrepresents both what he literally said and what he meant.

1171,"### Context: The claim that Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar co-sponsored legislation to recognize Muslim holidays as federal holidays is false. The article that made this claim was published on a website called ""So Right It Hurts,"" which describes its content as ""paradoxical"" and ""for parody purposes only."" The website states that its articles are not meant to be taken seriously and are provided for comic effect or ridicule.

The article alleged that Tlaib and Omar introduced a bill to add two Islamic observances, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, to the roster of federally recognized holidays. It also claimed that the congresswomen were considering adding regular Salah time breaks for school children and workers, as well as designated areas in public businesses for Muslims to perform Salah.

However, as of mid-January 2019, neither Tlaib nor Omar had sponsored or co-sponsored any legislation related to Islamic affairs. It is also unlikely that their first legislative endeavor would be to create new federal holidays, as the last time Congress passed a bill designating a new federal holiday was in 1983.

The article from ""So Right It Hurts"" was fabricated and not based on any factual information. The website itself includes a disclaimer stating that its content is paradoxical and for parody purposes only. It also states that the information provided should not be considered accurate or reliable.

In conclusion, the claim that Tlaib and Omar co-sponsored legislation to recognize Muslim holidays as federal holidays is false. The article that made this claim was published on a website known for its parody content and should not be taken seriously.

1172,"### Context: Planned Parenthood is urging states to oppose the Trump administration's proposal to prohibit family planning clinics funded by the government's Title X program from making abortion referrals. The rule, dubbed a ""gag rule"" by opponents, was set to take effect next week but has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge following a lawsuit filed by attorneys general in 20 mostly Democrat-controlled states. Dr. Leana Wen, the president of Planned Parenthood, emphasized the importance of states as a backstop against the Trump-Pence administration's efforts to restrict women's health and rights. She praised Maryland as a leader among states opposing the rule, as it recently passed a measure that would end participation in the program if the rule takes effect. Massachusetts and other blue states are also considering similar measures. Republican-leaning states, on the other hand, are working to pass legislation that could prompt the Supreme Court to revisit its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee have all introduced or approved restrictive abortion laws. The Trump administration's rule change is supported by religious conservatives and abortion opponents who argue that Title X funding indirectly subsidizes Planned Parenthood. However, Wen clarified that Title X funding is not used for abortions but rather to provide low-income individuals with affordable birth control, cancer screenings, HIV tests, and other primary and preventive care services. She criticized the rule change as an attempt to restrict the practice of medicine and politicians making decisions for doctors and patients. Planned Parenthood, which serves a significant number of women through Title X, has stated that it will leave the program if the rule is implemented.

1173,"### Context: The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report calling for significant changes to farming and eating habits in order to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on land and water resources. While the report does not explicitly advocate for going meat-free, it suggests that plant-based foods and sustainable animal-sourced food could free up millions of square kilometers of land by 2050 and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.7-8.0 gigatonnes per year. The report emphasizes that certain diets have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land.

The IPCC warns that the window for making these changes is closing fast and that delaying emissions reductions will hinder the successful management of the climate change transition in the land sector. Land surface air temperature has risen by 1.53 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, causing heatwaves, droughts, heavy rain, land degradation, and desertification. Human use directly affects over 70% of the global land surface, and agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use.

Agriculture, forestry, and other land use activities are responsible for 23% of total net man-made greenhouse gas emissions, which rises to up to 37% when pre- and post-production activity in the food system is included. The report also highlights the environmental costs that should be factored into food production and warns of more disruption to global food chains due to climate change. It projects a median increase of 7.6% in cereal prices by 2050, leading to higher food prices and an increased risk of hunger.

The report mentions that changing consumption habits have contributed to about 2 billion adults being overweight or obese, while an estimated 821 million people are undernourished. Additionally, 25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted. The report also addresses the impact of deforestation and desertification on global warming, noting that reducing deforestation and forest degradation could result in a significant reduction of CO2 emissions.

The report does not directly mention the Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the ""lungs of the world,"" but Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro's support for opening up protected areas of the rainforest for agriculture and mining is a concern. The report, prepared by over 100 scientists, must be approved by governments, and during discussions, Brazil and India were active in protecting their national agro-industrial interests.

1174,"### Context: Tissue samples from two gorillas that died in the forests of northern Rwanda in 2009 were infected with the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) virus, according to The Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project. The research also found that the frequency and severity of respiratory disease outbreaks among mountain gorillas straddling Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo was increasing. “We report conclusive evidence for association of a human virus with death in mountain gorillas. Viral RNA in multiple tissue samples from the adult female indicates that she was infected by an HMPV strain at the time of her death,” it said. With a total known world population of 786, the gorillas are one of the region’s biggest tourist attractions. Visitors pay hundreds of dollars to trek through dense forest and get within meters of the great apes. Their numbers have risen by more than a quarter in the last seven years, a sign conservation efforts are paying off although perhaps at a cost. “Although human proximity to mountain gorillas is essential for their conservation, also crucial is minimizing the risk for human-to-great ape transmission of respiratory pathogens,” the report said. “Because there are fewer than 800 living mountain gorillas, each individual is critically important to the survival of their species,” the project’s executive director Mike Cranfield said.
Claim: Human virus linked to mountain gorilla deaths.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"A virus that causes respiratory disease in humans has been linked to the deaths of critically endangered mountain gorillas in east Africa, a U.S. veterinary research group said Wednesday.",Human virus linked to mountain gorilla deaths.,"A human virus has been linked to the deaths of two mountain gorillas in the wilds of Rwanda, conservationists said on Thursday."
1175,"### Context: The article discusses the symptoms of Covid-19 and provides information on how the virus behaves in the body. It states that the symptoms of Covid-19 include a sore throat lasting 3 or 4 days, followed by the virus blending into nasal fluid and entering the trachea and lungs, causing pneumonia. Pneumonia is characterized by high fever and difficulty breathing. The article also mentions that nasal congestion during Covid-19 feels like drowning.

The claim mentioned in the prompt is that if the new coronavirus enters the mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash it down through the esophagus into the stomach, where the acid will kill the virus. However, if enough water is not consumed regularly, the virus can enter the windpipes and lungs. The article does not specifically address this claim.

The article also mentions that a runny nose and sputum are symptoms of the common cold, not Covid-19. However, it notes that these symptoms do not rule out Covid-19, as some patients with the virus do experience pneumonia and a dry cough. It is important to note that a runny nose does not necessarily rule out Covid-19.

Regarding the virus's resistance to heat, the article states that there is no evidence to support the claim that the virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of 26/27 degrees. While similar viruses may transmit less effectively in higher temperatures, many countries with reported Covid-19 cases are experiencing temperatures higher than this.

The article mentions that if someone with the new coronavirus sneezes, the droplets can travel about 10 feet before dropping to the ground. However, the distance the droplets spread depends on environmental factors and is likely to be several meters. The claim that the virus can live on metal surfaces for at least 12 hours is mentioned, but the article states that the exact survival time on surfaces is still unknown.

The claim that drinking warm water is effective for all viruses is not supported by evidence, according to the article. There is no evidence that the temperature of liquids consumed can protect or cure diseases caused by viruses.

The article concludes by stating that the symptoms described for Covid-19 are roughly accurate, although not everyone with the virus gets pneumonia, and the symptoms may not occur in the exact order or at specific times. The claim about nasal congestion feeling like drowning is not mentioned by the NHS as a specific symptom for Covid-19.

1177,"### Context: The northern region of Lombardy in Italy, which has been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has pledged to distribute at least 3 million masks to the public through supermarkets, pharmacists, and tobacconists. However, until the masks arrive, many people have resorted to using scarves or homemade substitutes. The region has been struggling to find enough protective gear, and residents have expressed frustration with the lack of availability. Lombardy has been the worst affected area in Italy, with over 50,000 cases and almost 9,000 deaths.

The masks that will be distributed are expected to be less elaborate than the top-grade medical masks used in hospitals. The decision to issue the masks order came after weeks of official advice stating that masks were not necessary for most people and should be reserved for health workers. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended the use of cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus, especially in confined spaces.

A report by consumer association Altroconsumo found that 43% of pharmacists in eight different Italian cities did not have any masks available, with almost half of the pharmacies in Milan being out of stock. The scarcity of masks has led to people improvising with scarves or making their own masks. While it is unclear whether these alternatives are effective, research has shown that face masks could help limit the spread of the virus.

The head of the Civil Protection department in Italy, responsible for coordinating the country's disaster response, has emphasized the importance of maintaining social distancing as the best protection against the virus. He stated that he would not be wearing a mask. However, there has been little public opposition to the new measures, with many residents believing that face masks protect both themselves and others.

In conclusion, the article highlights the scramble for masks in Lombardy, Italy, as the region orders the distribution of 3 million masks to the public. The scarcity of masks has led to people resorting to scarves or homemade substitutes. While the official advice initially stated that masks were not necessary for most people, the recommendation has shifted to the use of cloth face coverings. Despite the challenges in obtaining masks, there has been little public opposition to the new measures, with many residents recognizing the importance of wearing masks to protect themselves and others.

1178,"### Context: Two separate teams of doctors have reported successes in using gene therapy to treat Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a condition that damages light receptors in the retina and leads to total blindness. LCA usually begins affecting sight in early childhood and causes complete blindness by the time a patient is 30. Currently, there is no treatment available for this condition. 

Both teams used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the damaged gene, called RPE65, directly into the eyes of patients. Although the trials were only testing for safety, patients reported improved vision after the treatments. Dr. Katherine High and her colleagues at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute treated three volunteers, all of whom experienced improved vision. Dr. Robin Ali and his colleagues at University College London treated three volunteers as well, with one of them showing improvement. 

The fact that patients with severe sight loss and who received low doses of treatment experienced any improvement was unexpected. Dr. High stated that this result is important for the entire field of gene therapy. One of the volunteers in Dr. Ali's trial, Steven Howarth, reported significant improvement in night vision, allowing him to navigate a simulation of a night-time street. Dr. Ali expressed hope for the effectiveness of the treatment based on this evidence of improvement. 

In Dr. High's trial, all three patients reported better vision, with their vision improving from detecting hand movements to reading lines on an eye chart. Only one eye was treated in each case, allowing the other eye to serve as a control to determine whether vision improved. 

Both teams were also looking for proof that the virus used in the treatment did not leave the eye. They found that the virus stayed in the eye and did not spread elsewhere in the body. 

The next stage of testing will involve treating children, as their eyes have deteriorated less and they have a better chance of improvement. The teams are hopeful that they will be able to arrest the damage in younger children. 

Overall, these successful gene therapy trials for LCA have provided hope for the effectiveness of the treatment and have shown that the virus used remains localized in the eye.

1179,"### Context: The article discusses the first trial of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children and highlights the significant benefits observed. However, it also points out some limitations and areas where more information could have been provided.

The article mentions that the cost of surgery is noted, but it fails to mention the estimated costs of drug therapies, hospitalizations, and institutionalization for severely disabled children and adults with seizure disorders. It also does not specify the number of children who had the primary outcome of being seizure-free for a year, making it difficult for readers to understand the 10-fold increase in odds mentioned in the lead.

The article does not provide details about the number and types of surgeries performed on different ages of children, which would have been helpful for readers to compare alternatives. It also does not specify the specific types of cognitive and other tests used to evaluate the outcomes in the children.

While the article mentions that 77% of the children were seizure-free after one year of surgery compared to 7% in the control group, it does not state the absolute number of children who experienced improvement after surgery. However, the article provides enough information for readers to understand the measured benefits, leading to a change in the rating from Not Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

The article notes that drug therapies are the standard of care but does not specify the drugs used. It also does not provide information about the general availability of the operations or define categories of candidates, apart from mentioning that costs are a frequent barrier in India.

The article acknowledges that this is the first trial of its kind in children and highlights the scarcity of randomized trials comparing surgery to medical therapy. It clarifies that while the study shows a decrease in seizure frequency in children, there is no evidence to support the statement that earlier surgery is better.

Overall, the article provides information about the benefits of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children but lacks specific details about the surgeries performed, the number of children who experienced improvement, and the limitations of the study. It also fails to provide information about the specific types of cognitive and other tests used to evaluate outcomes and the availability of the operations.

1180,"### Context: The claim in the Facebook post that Walmart, Amazon, Kroger, Target, and Costco have not had any reported cases of COVID-19 among their employees is false. News reports have documented numerous cases of employees at these companies contracting the virus. 

For example, a Walmart in Worcester, Massachusetts closed in April after 23 employees tested positive for COVID-19, and that number had nearly doubled to 41 employees by May 1. Two Walmart employees from a Chicago-area store have died from the virus. In a New Jersey Amazon warehouse, about 48 infections were reported among employees. An Amazon worker in Tracy, California died from complications of COVID-19. An employee at an Amazon fulfillment center in Seattle tested positive for the virus after feeling ill. Four workers at separate Kroger stores in Michigan died after being infected with COVID-19, and 13 employees at 10 different Kroger stores in Louisville, Kentucky tested positive. A Target employee in Short Pump, Virginia has also tested positive, and more Target employees in Georgia, North Dakota, North Carolina, and California have been infected. Managers in at least eight Costco stores reportedly notified staff that a coworker had tested positive for COVID-19, and an employee at a Seattle-area Costco died after contracting the virus.

These cases involving employees at Walmart, Amazon, Kroger, Target, and Costco have been well-documented in news reports, contradicting the claim made in the Facebook post. Therefore, the claim that these companies have not had any reported cases of COVID-19 among their employees is false.

1181,"### Context: A study published in JAMA Surgery suggests that women with Stage 4 breast cancer may have longer survival rates if they undergo surgery in addition to non-surgical treatment. The study found that women who underwent breast surgery had a median survival of 28 months, compared to 19 months for those who did not have surgery. However, the article notes that the number of surgeries has decreased over time, raising questions about the effectiveness of the approach.

The article acknowledges that the cost of breast surgery in the US can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of surgery, hospital, and region. While the exact costs are not provided, the article suggests that the cost of surgery could be a relevant consideration when evaluating the benefits of surgery versus non-surgical treatment.

The potential benefits of surgery are reported in absolute terms, but the article also cautions that surgery may not be the right option for all women and that it may have improved since 1995. The article also highlights the potential complications of breast surgery, such as bleeding, infection, and psychological impacts on body image and sexual arousal.

The study has some limitations, including the use of retrospective data, which may render the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making. The over-representation of African-American women in the study is also noted as a limitation. The article mentions two prospective studies that found no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer.

The article does not engage in disease mongering and interviews two independent sources who provide a critical perspective on the study. The availability of risk-reducing breast surgery is not in question, as it has been an option for women with breast cancer since at least 1988.

Overall, the article provides a cautious and balanced view of the study, acknowledging its limitations and potential costs and complications associated with surgery.
Claim: Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This story is about a large retrospective study that was published this week in the journal JAMA Surgery. The research suggests women who opted for surgery to treat their breast cancer had better survival rates than those who didn’t, even though the number of surgeries has plunged from 1988 to 2011. This Washington Post report does many things well: It quantifies the benefits of breast surgery in absolute terms, points out the study’s limitations and doesn’t make sweeping recommendations based on this research. Furthermore, the story uses cautionary language, making readers really question whether surgery is the better option for stage 4 breast cancer patients. It also incorporates two independent sources who provide some critical perspectives, such as the two other small studies that showed no correlation between surgery and survival in this group of women. We would have liked to have seen more discussion on the harms of breast surgeries, as well as the existing therapies for breast cancer patients. And we would have liked for the report to have pointed out that usually younger women underwent surgery in the study, which may have affected the results. Overall, however, the Washington Post puts forth a thorough, nuanced story based on the latest findings. Though current screening recommendations for breast cancer are intended to identify cancers at an earlier, more curable stage of disease, women still present with metastatic disease (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). This can occur because of not having screening or not having it regularly enough, or it may relate to aggressive disease that develops and metastasizes prior to it being detected on standard imaging tests. For those women with metastatic disease, particularly younger ones, cure and thus long-term survival is uncommon. The question addressed in this story is whether the addition of surgery to standard aggressive therapy – generally chemotherapy and radiation treatment – leads to longer survival. The story does a good job of describing the benefit seen in this retrospective study as well as highlighting its limitations. Specifically, there is no evidence from higher quality, prospective studies that surgery provides additional survival benefit. Clearly such studies are needed and the article suggests that such studies are currently underway. The challenge is what to recommend for women who currently face this treatment decision. The simple answer is that we don’t really know and the article does a good job of not overselling surgery based upon the results of this study.","Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows","This story reports on a study that found that women with Stage 4 breast cancer who underwent breast surgery had a longer survival rate than those who did not have surgery. The story does a good job of explaining the limitations of the study and of the evidence. It also does a good job of describing the potential complications of surgery. The story could have been improved by including the costs of surgery and by quantifying the harms of surgery in absolute terms. The story also could have been improved by mentioning that the study was observational and that the women in the study were not randomly assigned to surgery or no surgery. The story also could have been improved by mentioning that the study was published in JAMA Surgery, a journal with a readership of surgeons."
1182,"### Context: The article discusses a study that suggests maintaining healthy vision may also help keep the brain in shape. The study, funded by the National Eye Institute and the Jane Kroger Fund, involved over 2,500 individuals over a period of 8 years. The study used a cross-lagged analysis to examine the relationship between eyesight and cognitive function. The analysis found that the relationship between vision and cognition was stronger in the direction of vision to cognition, rather than the opposite. However, the correlations in both directions were modest. The article mentions that while there is evidence that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, its impact would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively.

The article also mentions the high costs associated with maintaining visual capabilities in the United States, including diagnostic visits, expensive eyewear, and medical procedures for age-related problems like cataracts and macular degeneration. However, the article does not provide specific details about the costs of these options. It also does not provide a clear understanding of the strength of the link between vision and cognition.

The article suggests that both cognitive decline and vision loss accompany aging, and exploring the relationship between the two would be beneficial. It mentions that other studies have also explored this relationship in recent years. The article implies that the vision treatments mentioned in the study, such as new eyeglass prescriptions or cataract surgery, are available in the marketplace.

Overall, the article provides some details about the study, but leaves out important information such as the costs of vision-related options and the strength of the vision-cognition link. It also suggests that further research, including clinical trials, is needed to conclusively prove the impact of vision on cognitive health.
Claim: Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together. But does one cause the other? In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period. The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options. But such behavior awaits more robust studies, and stories about this link need to tread cautiously.","Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too","This story reports on a study that found a modest correlation between vision loss and cognitive decline in older adults. The story does a good job of explaining the study’s design and limitations, and it makes it clear that the findings don’t mean that getting one’s vision checked could prevent dementia. However, the story doesn’t address the costs of vision care, which are substantial, and it doesn’t explain the strength of the link between vision and cognition. It also could have been more clear that the study’s findings don’t mean that getting one’s vision checked could prevent dementia. Dementia and cognitive decline are a major concern for older adults, and any research that sheds light on the factors that contribute to it is newsworthy. But it’s also important to be clear about the limitations of such research, and to be clear about the costs of the interventions that might be used to try to prevent cognitive decline."
1183,"### Context: The article discusses the benefits of ""same-day"" hip replacement procedures, which allow patients to go home on the same day as their surgery. The article mentions that there is no discussion of the costs of hip replacement, despite it being a common procedure with widely discussed costs. The average cost of hip replacement is around $30,000, but there are significant variations in cost between different locations.

The article notes that the main advantage of same-day hip replacement is that patients are less likely to spend a night in the hospital. However, there are only vague references and quotes from a surgeon regarding how many patients actually go home the same day. The article also mentions that studies have found no important differences in outcomes between same-day and traditional hip replacement procedures.

The article acknowledges that there are potential risks and complications associated with same-day hip replacement, such as falling at home due to dizziness or inadequate preparation for managing major surgery. However, it does not provide any data or information to support the claim that staying in the hospital after surgery ""doesn't make sense.""

The article also mentions that there are few good studies comparing outcomes of different types of hip replacement procedures, and that the choice may depend on the personal experiences and preferences of individual surgeons rather than robust scientific evidence.

The article highlights that younger, healthier people may face a second hip replacement procedure at an older age, as hip replacements have a lifespan of 20 to 25 years. It suggests that the timing of the first procedure should take this into consideration.

The article criticizes the imbalance in the representation of surgeons in the story, with the surgeon advocating for same-day hip replacement being featured more prominently. It also points out that the story fails to disclose that NYU Langone Medical Center has a marketing campaign tied to same-day hip surgery, which may influence the coverage.

Overall, the article suggests that while same-day hip replacement may offer advantages, there are potential risks and limitations that should be considered. It also raises concerns about the lack of discussion on costs and the potential influence of marketing efforts on the coverage of the procedure.
Claim: Same-day hip replacements get patients back on their feet
The claim veracity: false

### Explanation:
",false,"This is a story about “same-day” hip replacement surgery. The story gives readers the impression that a few pioneering institutions are offering patients a superior procedure, when the reality is that hospital stays after hip replacement have been steadily shortening for many years, to the point that it is not unusual for some otherwise healthy patients to go home without spending a night in the hospital. The story includes important cautions from a skeptical surgeon, but the prominence of the surgeon and institution that are actively marketing this procedure results in a story that implies greater benefits and fewer risks than there is evidence to support. The same surgeon and hospital were featured in a Wall Street Journal story that we reviewed in February. There are more than 300,000 hip replacement procedures performed in the United States each year. The many hundreds of thousands of people who have hip pain and are considering hip replacement need news stories that clearly and precisely state the benefits and harms of the various procedures.",Same-day hip replacements get patients back on their feet,"The story’s headline, “Same-day hip replacements get patients back on their feet,” is a misleading overstatement. The story’s main point is that some patients who have hip replacement surgery can go home the same day. But the story doesn’t provide any data to support the claim that same-day surgery is a better option than a traditional hospital stay. The story also doesn’t mention that there are few good studies comparing the outcomes of different types of hip replacement procedures.

1184,"### Context: Advocates for legalizing marijuana in Georgia claim that about 100 people are arrested each day for possession of marijuana in the state. These advocates argue that Georgia has spent billions of tax dollars enforcing ineffective prohibition laws against marijuana. James Bell, the director of Georgia C.A.R.E., stated that more than 35,000 arrests occur for marijuana offenses each year in Georgia, with 85% of those arrests being for possession. However, PolitiFact Georgia wanted to verify whether this claim is accurate.

To investigate the claim, PolitiFact reviewed FBI crime data and found that marijuana accounted for 52.1% of all arrests for drug abuse violations nationwide in 2010, with 45.8% of those arrests being for possession. In 2011, the percentage of marijuana arrests dropped slightly to 49.5%, with 43.3% of those arrests being for possession. Marijuana policy researcher Jon Gettman also provided data from FBI data, which showed that Georgia had an average of about 28,000 possession arrests per year from 2008 to 2010.

However, calculating arrests can be complex, as it depends on various factors such as whether multiple arrests for a single person are counted individually and if all jurisdictions report arrests. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program counts one arrest for each separate instance in which a person is arrested, cited, or summoned for an offense. Therefore, the FBI's arrest data reflects the number of times people are arrested, not the number of people who have been arrested.

Based on this information, it is unclear whether the claim that about 100 people are arrested each day for possession of marijuana in Georgia is accurate. While the data provided by James Bell and Jon Gettman suggest a high number of possession arrests in Georgia, the FBI's arrest data does not provide an accurate estimate of the number of people arrested. Therefore, PolitiFact rates the claim as ""up in smoke.""
Claim: Every day, ""about 100 people will be arrested for possession of marijuana in Georgia.

Search and rescue teams are using devices that detect mobile phone signals to help guide their efforts. Thousands of people are homeless or afraid to return to their houses, and more than 11,000 people have been displaced and are staying at shelters and mosques or with relatives. About 10,500 homes were damaged and dozens of mosques and shop houses collapsed. The Indonesian government has sent 50 tons of urgent aid to Aceh, including generators, tents, folding beds, baby supplies, and body bags. The military is setting up an emergency field hospital and sending two dozen doctors, and the Health Ministry is sending a medical team and medicines. The Red Cross and other humanitarian groups are also providing aid. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.5, was centered near the northern tip of Sumatra and did not generate a tsunami. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes due to its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire."" The 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Aceh killed a total of 230,000 people.

1186,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Senator Rand Paul that vaccinations should be left to parental choice and that it is an issue of freedom. Dr. Celine Gounder, a physician, argues that as an eye surgeon, Paul should be advocating for measles vaccination because measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide. The article supports Gounder's claim by citing sources such as the World Health Organization and academic studies. It explains that while measles does not typically lead to blindness in developed countries with high vaccination rates, it is a leading cause of blindness in children in low-income countries where access to vaccines is limited and malnutrition is prevalent. The article also mentions that corneal scarring from measles and a deficiency of vitamin A are major causes of blindness in these countries. It explains that the cornea requires vitamin A to function properly and a measles infection can reduce the levels of vitamin A in the body, leading to ulcers in the cornea and a loss of vision. The article states that countries with vaccination programs for measles have reduced the problem of widespread eye disease and recommends that children in developing countries who contract measles receive vitamin A supplements. The article concludes by stating that Gounder's claim is correct and that in developed countries, measles does not typically lead to blindness, but in low-income countries, it is a leading cause of blindness in children.
Claim: Measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide.

1187,"### Context: The article discusses a hearing at the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the funding of Planned Parenthood in Texas. The case involves Texas' decision to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood clinics after the release of secretly recorded videos by anti-abortion activists in 2015. The videos allegedly showed Planned Parenthood improperly changing abortion procedures to preserve better specimens for medical research. Planned Parenthood and a group of Medicaid beneficiaries sued to preserve Medicaid coverage for non-abortion-related health services for low-income women at 30 clinics in Texas.

U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks had previously ruled that Texas officials provided no evidence of wrongdoing and that the videos were insufficient as evidence. He issued an injunction blocking Texas from withholding the funding. However, in January, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit stated that Judge Sparks should give greater weight to state findings on whether Planned Parenthood clinic staff members are qualified under Medicaid's standards. The full court agreed to take a broader look at the issue, leading to the hearing.

The article mentions that the issue has a complicated history at the 5th Circuit. In 2016, a three-judge panel unanimously upheld an injunction preventing Louisiana from cutting Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding. However, one of the judges later changed her mind, resulting in a 2-1 decision. Louisiana requested a full-court rehearing, which led to a 7-7 deadlock in 2017. Since then, five nominees of President Donald Trump have filled vacancies on the 5th Circuit.

During the hearing, arguments were made regarding whether Medicaid patients and healthcare providers should be able to sue over a state's decision to withhold funding, bypassing state administrative procedures. The judges questioned whether individuals have the right to choose a qualified provider and how much authority the state has in deciding which providers are qualified.

The article concludes by stating that it is unclear when the 5th Circuit will rule and how broadly they will rule. The ruling could potentially affect Planned Parenthood funding in Louisiana and Mississippi as well, as the 5th Circuit covers all three states.

The story adequately quantifies the mortality benefit from colonoscopy screening. But we wish the story had quantified the benefit in absolute rather than relative terms. The story mentions the risk of perforations, missed cancers and ""unpleasant"" preparation as the risks/side effects of colonoscopy. The story does a good job of describing the current study as well as placing it in context with other studies. The story does not exaggerate the seriousness or prevalence of colon cancer.

Claim: Colonoscopies Miss Many Cancers, Study Finds
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"Screening has been proven to reduce the risk of death from colorectal cancer. Yet fewer than 50% of people get screened, lagging behind other cancer screening tests such as mammography and PSA testing. Colonoscopy is considered the reference standard against which other colorectal cancer screening tests are measured, however, it is not perfect. Indeed, new data published ahead of print in this week’s Annals of Internal Medicine suggest that colonoscopy may miss more cancers and polyps than previously thought and reduce colorectal-cancer specific mortality by 60 to 70% instead of the frequently-cited 90% reduction. This story does a good job of describing the current study and placing it in context with other studies. It explains the relevance of these new findings to the consumer – colonoscopy still prevents cancer deaths, however it has its limitations and people need to adjust their expectations of what it can do for them. Furthermore, the study rightly brings focus to the importance of proper preparation. The story could have been improved with a few simple additions.

1190,"### Context: Spain has reported over 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus, making it the country with the second-highest death toll after Italy. On Thursday, Spain recorded its highest one-day death toll since the start of the epidemic. The number of registered coronavirus cases in the country has risen to 110,238, with an 8% increase from the previous day. The daily rate of new infections has been slowing since March 25, when reported cases rose by just over 20%. The Health Minister of Spain stated that there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and that the curve has stabilized, indicating the start of the slowdown phase.

Spain has been under lockdown since March 14, with only employees in essential sectors allowed to travel to and from work. As a result, the country has lost an unprecedented 900,000 jobs, with temporary layoffs affecting at least 620,000 other jobs. Around 80,000 workers are sick with coronavirus, while 170,000 more are on sick leave due to contact with an infected person. Nursing homes, where elderly residents are highly vulnerable, have been severely impacted by the virus. Funeral service workers were seen removing coffins from a nursing home in Madrid, where 50 residents had died since the start of the epidemic. Two-thirds of the residents tested in another nursing home had coronavirus.

In the region of Madrid, around 3,000 people have died in nursing homes in March, three times the normal monthly toll. However, the administration lacks testing and cannot confirm how many of these deaths were caused by the coronavirus. In Catalonia, the second worst-hit region after Madrid, the government has asked the national military for medical teams to help tackle the virus. The region's intensive care capacity is said to be ""at the limit"". Catalonia's push for independence from Madrid has caused political turmoil.

Despite the high death toll, there is a glimpse of hope in Spain as the daily rate of new infections has been slowing down. The Health Minister believes that the country has reached the peak of the curve and has entered the slowdown phase. However, the impact on the economy and the vulnerable elderly population in nursing homes remains a major concern.

1191,"### Context: The article discusses the potential benefits of an experimental prostate drug called XL184. The story mentions that the drug is still under study and not available for sale, so there is no information about its cost. It also highlights that the drug has shown improvement in bone scans for some men, but it is unclear if this translates into a change in the cancer itself or if it has any long-term effects.

The article mentions that Provenge, an FDA-approved drug for advanced prostate cancer, costs $93,000 per patient. It states that Provenge has been shown to help men live 4 months longer, but it does not mention any potential harms associated with its use.

Regarding XL184, the article fails to mention any possible harms associated with the drug, even though information from the company indicates that side effects such as fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, high blood pressure, rash, 'hand-foot syndrome', and cough have been observed in patients treated with XL184 for 6 weeks or more.

The article also lacks information about the study design, length of treatment, length of follow-up, and adverse events reported in the study. It does not adequately explain the ongoing study on XL184 or provide context from an expert on prostate cancer to evaluate the benefits of the drug.

The story does mention that XL184 is being studied in a phase II trial for various solid tumors, including castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, it does not provide enough information about the target group of men who would be appropriate candidates for the drug.

The article does mention that XL184 improves bone scans after 6 weeks of treatment, but it does not clarify if it changes the course of the cancer itself or if it extends the lifespan of patients.

Overall, the article provides limited information about XL184 and Provenge, focusing mainly on the positive findings of the study without discussing potential harms or long-term outcomes. It does not explain the source of the information or engage in disease mongering.
Claim: In Small Test, Experimental Prostate Drug Shows Promise
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Notwithstanding the headline, this is a story about two drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer – Provenge, a drug recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and XL184, a compound currently under study. Combining the information for these treatments is a bit confusing. The news about XL184 reflected results which at that point had not yet been presented at a cancer conference in Berlin. While indicating that it is too early to say whether XL184 actually affects the cancer, the story should have reminded readers of the importance of things like quality of life and survival time. And there isn’t evidence about those factors yet with XL184. At issue is that, while advanced prostate cancer is a challenge, not all men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from Provenge, though the story neglected this. And it is not clear that XL184 is of benefit to anyone. News about results from a small study that is still ongoing cannot carry enough caveats. It is really too early to know whether XL184 really shows promise or not. It is bad enough when journalists write glowing stories based on reports from scientific meetings. This story goes one step beyond that and reports on the outcome of a small trial before the scientific meeting has even been held. Although there are numerous caveats embedded in the story, it still provides a rather optimistic view of a drug based on early testing in 20 men. For reasons that we don’t understand, the story only reports on 20 of the 99 men enrolled in the study and only reports on the more positive results (those related to bone scans). This selective reporting provides the readers with a very limited and imbalanced view of the study results.","In Small Test, Experimental Prostate Drug Shows Promise","This story reports on a new drug, XL184, which is being studied for its potential to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer.

1192,"### Context: The article discusses a press release that claims metformin may lower the risk of lung cancer in diabetic nonsmokers. However, the article raises several concerns about the release. Firstly, it points out that the cost of metformin is not mentioned, which is important information for readers, especially considering the lifetime use of diabetes medication. The article also highlights that the release fails to mention potential harms associated with metformin, such as harmful side effects affecting the stomach or bowel. 

Another issue raised is the release's description of the results. The research paper only shows a statistically significant reduction in lung cancer risk among diabetic patients who have never smoked, but the release generalizes this finding to all nonsmokers. The article emphasizes that this distinction is important and should have been clarified in the release. 

The article also criticizes the use of an active verb in the headline, stating that it is inappropriate since the study is observational and cannot prove cause and effect. The release should have used language that indicates an association or link, rather than claiming that metformin ""lowered"" the risk of lung cancer. 

Furthermore, the article argues that the release focuses on a minor finding that applies to a small subset of individuals in the study, while downplaying the larger overall findings. The overall finding of the study is that metformin generally has no effect on lung cancer risk, which the article suggests is not newsworthy. 

The article acknowledges that the release does not engage in disease-mongering and properly discloses funding sources and conflicts of interest. However, it criticizes the release for not mentioning the importance of not smoking or quitting smoking to reduce the risk of lung cancer. 

Overall, the article raises concerns about the release's lack of information on cost, potential harms, and the generalization of findings. It also questions the newsworthiness of the study and suggests that the release should have provided more context and emphasized the larger overall findings.
Claim: Metformin may lower lung cancer risk in diabetic nonsmokers
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"This release reports on an NIH-funded study to determine if the use of the drug metformin by diabetic patients may affect their risk of developing lung cancer. The overall answer is that it does not, but the release takes five paragraphs to say that. Instead, it focuses on a very small subset of patients who had never smoked and whose lung cancer risk appeared to be lower than never-smokers who didn’t take metformin. By trumpeting findings from that subgroup — and burying the main results of the study, which were negative — this release misrepresents the research findings and misleads its readers. We’d suggest that the findings of this study probably did not warrant the spotlight provided by a news release. But if a news release is to be issued, it should lead with the results for the primary outcome and give second billing to provocative but preliminary findings from subgroups. While not as egregious as another example of subgroup “spin” that we recently reported on, this news release will certainly give readers the impression that there’s something special about metformin when it comes to preventing cancer in people with diabetes, when that hasn’t been established with any certainty. Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long-term use of drugs such as metformin. Some research suggests that metformin may decrease the risk of lung cancer — making the results of this study an important addition to the scientific literature. Unfortunately, the release focuses almost entirely on the results seen in a small subgroup of patients. As such, it doesn’t accurately reflect the totality of the research in question. Subgroup findings can be included, but should never supersede the main outcome.",Metformin may lower lung cancer risk in diabetic nonsmokers,"This news release describes a study that found a lower risk of lung cancer among diabetic patients who took the drug metformin. The release does a good job of describing the study and its findings, but it doesn’t address costs, potential harms, or the limitations of the research. The release also generalizes the findings to all nonsmokers, when the study only looked at diabetic patients. The release would have been stronger had it pointed out that the study’s findings are not generalizable to the general population.

1193,"### Context: India is set to impose a nationwide ban on plastic bags, cups, small bottles, straws, and some types of sachets next month as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to reduce single-use plastic. However, this move has raised concerns among consumer firms that use plastic in their packaging. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a lobby group, has expressed worries about the ban, stating that it poses an ""existential issue"" for multiple sectors. The CII plans to ask the government to consult industry executives and define what will be categorized as single-use plastics, while also advocating for exemptions. They argue that small-sized plastic bottles used for pharmaceutical or health products should be exempted as there are no alternatives available. They also suggest that sachets made from multi-layered packaging should not be banned as it could disrupt the supply of key products such as biscuits, salt, and milk.

The Indian government is reviewing several industry representations, but their aim is to eliminate plastic pollution without causing disruption. Prime Minister Modi has urged people and government agencies to take the first step towards freeing India of single-use plastic on October 2. While environmentalists have praised this move, a ban on certain plastics from October 2 could potentially disrupt business plans for the upcoming Hindu festivals, which see a significant rise in consumer purchases.

Concerns have been raised by companies like Amazon, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Hindustan Unilever. Amazon is worried that a possible ban could disrupt its operations ahead of festivities and its annual discount sale. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have expressed concerns and discussed alternate packaging solutions with government officials. Coca-Cola stated that all its primary packaging does not consist of single-use plastic, while PepsiCo aims to make 100 percent of its packaging recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable by 2025. Hindustan Unilever did not respond to requests for comment.

The ban on single-use plastics has ramifications for various sectors, including food processing, dairy, garments, and toys. The All India Plastic Manufacturers Association, which has 22,000 member companies, has expressed concerns about the ban. Overall, the article highlights the concerns of consumer firms and industry associations regarding the potential ban on single-use plastics in India.

1194,"### Context: The claim that abortionists have reduced the African-American population by more than 25 percent since 1973 is largely unsubstantiated. According to U.S. Census figures, the black population in the United States actually grew by 67 percent from 1973 to 2010. The claim is based on guesstimates and data limitations. The U.S. Census Bureau does not provide projections for what the population would have been without abortions, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have a complete record of the number of abortions on black mothers since Roe v. Wade. The Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion, also does not have a total for abortions by race and ethnicity since 1973. While it is true that if all black women who had abortions had carried their pregnancies to term, there would be more black people alive today, the claim is considerably inflated. Some pregnancies would have ended in stillbirths or spontaneous abortions, and some babies would have died as infants. Additionally, the risk of involuntary death for black citizens is higher than for white citizens. It is also important to note that most abortions are performed because the mother cannot afford a child or having a child would interfere with other responsibilities, not because of race. Overall, the claim made by Rep. Charles Van Zant is wildly incorrect and lacks evidence.
Claim: Abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973.

Van Zant’s statement is wildly incorrect by the most literal measure -- the African-American population has increased since 1973. There’s also problems with the claim if you buy into Van Zant’s logic. Namely, abortion statistics are incomplete and/or difficult to interpret. And there’s no one-to-one correlation between an abortion and the population today.",Abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973.,"Van Zant said, """"Abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973.""""

1195,"### Context: The claim that students at Emory University were offered ""emergency counseling"" after pro-Trump graffiti appeared overnight in campus ""safe spaces"" is not supported by the article. The article states that social media users began sharing articles reporting that students at Emory University were ""traumatized"" by the graffiti, but there is no mention of any counseling being offered. The term ""counseling"" only appeared in the comments section of an article published by the Emory Wheel, the university's student-run newspaper. The article also mentions that the term ""safe spaces"" was included as a paraphrase and not actually used by the students. 

The article describes a political protest inspired by the Trump graffiti, where students gathered outside the administration building with signs featuring slogans such as ""Stop Trump"" or ""Stop Hate."" The article also mentions that student organizations offered counseling to anyone who may have been impacted by the graffiti, but there is no evidence of any counseling being offered or sought by the students. 

The article clarifies that the actions of the students were in dispute because the use of chalk to mark structures is only permitted on certain campus areas, and the Trump chalkings appeared campus-wide, breaking the rules about acceptable use of chalk on campus. The university planned to review security camera footage to identify those responsible for the chalkings.

The article concludes by stating that the Emory University media controversy was one of several distorted claims of rampant political correctness on college campuses. It mentions other examples of exaggerated claims, such as students being offered counseling over mini sombreros at a party and Captain America being deemed offensive and banned. The article emphasizes that while some students of color expressed unease about the Trump chalkings, most simply gathered to express their political distaste for the candidate and his platforms on issues of race and religion.

In a statement issued by involved students on campus, they clarify that they are not scared of the chalk or mad about being politically challenged. They express their anger because they exercise their first amendment right to freedom of speech and face threats and the twisting of truth to protect bigotry. They call for equality and equity in communication and ask for support in fighting for their right to freedom of speech.

1196,"### Context: The article discusses a proposed anti-abortion bill in Ohio, House Bill 200, which would double the state's 24-hour waiting period for abortions, require doctors to inform patients that having an abortion increases the risk of breast cancer, and mandate women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasounds. The Ohio Democratic Party has criticized the bill, claiming that it would force women to endure transvaginal ultrasounds. 

The article examines whether the claim made by the Ohio Democratic Party is accurate. It states that the bill does not specify the type of ultrasound to be performed, only stating that it should be an ""obstetric"" ultrasound. However, experts say that transvaginal ultrasounds are often used during early pregnancy as they are more accurate than external transabdominal ultrasounds. The article cites sources provided by the Ohio Democratic Party, including a study published in the journal ""Seminars in Reproductive Medicine,"" which state that transvaginal ultrasounds are better at visualizing early pregnancy. 

The article also includes opinions from medical professionals. Dr. Anita Somani, a physician at Comprehensive Women's Care in Columbus, explains that depending on the age of the embryo or fetus and the patient's body type, a transvaginal ultrasound may be necessary to comply with the legislation. Dr. Daniel Grossman, a physician and vice president of research for the sexual and reproductive rights group Ibis Reproductive Health, agrees with Somani's assessment, stating that in most cases, a transvaginal ultrasound is needed to get a clear and detailed image of the embryo or fetus during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. Dr. Donna Harrison, executive director of the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also supports the use of transvaginal ultrasounds for early pregnancy.

The article concludes that while the Ohio Democratic Party's claim that all women seeking abortions would be forced to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds is not entirely accurate, many women seeking early-term abortions could face the internal procedure. The claim is rated as partially true.

1197,"### Context: Sanofi, one of the leading insulin producers, has announced a plan to cut the cost of insulin for some patients in the United States to $99 per month. This announcement comes just hours before one of its executives was set to testify before a congressional committee on the rising prices of insulin. Executives from other insulin producers, Eli Lilly & Co and Novo Nordisk A/S, will also testify. The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to ration their medication.

Under Sanofi's plan, people with diabetes in the United States can purchase up to 10 boxes of insulin pens or vials for $99 per month with a valid prescription, starting in June. This is an expansion of Sanofi's existing ""Insulin Valyou Savings Program"" launched last year. The move represents significant savings for patients already enrolled in the program, who were previously paying $99 for each vial of insulin and $149 for each pack of insulin pens.

Sanofi's Head of North America primary care, Michelle Carnahan, emphasized the company's commitment to ensuring that no one has to go without insulin. Sanofi's decision to cut insulin prices follows similar actions by other insulin manufacturers. Last month, Eli Lilly announced plans to sell a half-price, authorized generic version of its popular Humalog insulin injection.

Patients with high out-of-pocket insulin costs can participate in Sanofi's program regardless of their income level. However, the program cannot be offered to patients insured under government programs like Medicare or Medicaid. Sanofi believes that the pricing program is sustainable for the long term and expects it to be profitable. The company's diabetes business generated approximately 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in U.S. sales last year.

Since the launch of Sanofi's ""Insulins Valyou Savings Program"" last April, around 12,000 patients have utilized the program, resulting in savings of about $10 million. The aim of this initiative is to address the increasing criticism from patients and politicians regarding the high cost of insulin in the United States.

It mentions a tweet from Elon Musk that resurfaced during this time, in which he quoted Mustafa Kemal Atatürk saying, ""If one day, my words are against science, choose science."" The article highlights the tension between the need to protect public health and the desire to reopen the economy.

The article explains that various measures were implemented across states to combat the spread of the virus, leading to controversy over the potential economic impact. It mentions a tweet from Donald Trump suggesting that the cure should not be worse than the problem itself. The article also references a report from Imperial College London that predicted a high number of deaths in the United States and emphasized the need for strict suppression measures.

Anti-lockdown protests began to occur in April 2020, with protesters demanding the reopening of the economy. The article notes that some of these protests displayed anti-science and anti-Semitic sentiments. It also mentions the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 safety measures, such as claims that quarantine was not necessary for asymptomatic individuals.

The article discusses the importance of scientific evidence and the potential consequences of denying or undermining science. It mentions the World Health Organization's warning about the spread of misinformation and the need for credible sources. The article also highlights the role of social media in promoting anti-science views.

Elon Musk's tweets during this time are mentioned, with him expressing opinions against COVID-19 suppression measures and retweeting videos from controversial doctors. The article concludes by confirming the authenticity of a screenshot of Musk's tweet quoting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk about choosing science over opinions against science.

1199,"### Context: In a recent sketch on her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer, Amy Schumer and fellow comedian Kyle Dunnigan play infomercial hosts pitching viewers on the perfect ""stocking stuffer"": a handgun. Schumer's character claims that individuals with several felonies can still purchase a gun on the Internet or at a gun show. This claim is referring to the ""gun show loophole,"" which allows felons to buy guns from unlicensed sellers who are not required to conduct background checks. However, it is important to note that this kind of transaction is illegal under federal law, as felons are prohibited from purchasing guns unless their rights have been formally restored. 

The sketch also mentions that private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. Additionally, several states require background checks for all private gun sales. However, there is limited data on the number of people who actually buy guns without a background check. A 2015 survey conducted by professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities found that 22% of gun purchasers underwent no background check, but this number dropped to 15% when excluding purchases between family and friends.

The sketch also addresses the issue of suspected terrorists on the no-fly list being able to purchase guns. Schumer's character reassures a caller that being on the no-fly list does not prevent them from buying a gun. A 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that between February 2004 and December 2014, 2,233 people on the no-fly list applied to buy a weapon, and 2,043 were allowed to proceed.

Overall, Schumer's claim that individuals with several felonies can easily purchase a gun on the Internet or at a gun show is possible but illegal. While private sellers are not required to run background checks, federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. The context of the sketch is important, as Schumer's phrasing may make it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful, which is not the case.
Claim: You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"Schumer’s character said, ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."" The kind of transaction Schumer described is possible, though illegal, and far more complicated than her comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they could purchase a gun from private sellers over the Internet or at a gun show without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. Schumer is doing a comedy bit, but compared with similar claims we’ve checked, her phrasing makes it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful. That is not the case. The context is significant.",You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.,"Schumer said that """"you can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."""" Schumer’s phrasing may make it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful, but that’s not the case. It is possible for a felon to buy a gun from a private seller who is not required to run a background check. But such a transaction is illegal under federal law. The sketch is funny because it plays on the idea that buying a gun with a felony is easy, when in fact it is illegal."
1200,"### Context: The claim that the CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an epidemic due to a low death rate is flawed. The article that made this claim does not provide any death rate figures and misinterprets the CDC's definition of an epidemic. The CDC defines an epidemic as an increase in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected. The article cites a CDC webpage, but that page does not mention death rates in relation to defining an epidemic.

Official declarations about COVID-19 have been made by various health officials and leaders, but none of them declared an epidemic. The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary declared a public health emergency, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and President Donald Trump declared a national emergency.

The CDC's weekly summary of COVID-19 activity does not indicate that a drop in deaths signifies a turning point. The latest report available at the time of the Facebook post stated that mortality attributed to COVID-19 had decreased compared to the previous week but remained at the epidemic threshold. The CDC spokesperson clarified that the epidemic threshold refers to the point at which the observed proportion of deaths is significantly higher than expected without substantial influenza or COVID-related mortality. Death rates alone do not determine whether COVID-19 is still an epidemic, as the extent of the outbreak is the primary factor.

In conclusion, the claim that the CDC may have to stop calling COVID-19 an epidemic due to a low death rate is unfounded. The article that made this claim does not provide evidence or accurate information. The CDC's definition of an epidemic is based on an increase in cases, not death rates. The CDC's weekly reports indicate that COVID-19 mortality has decreased but remains at the epidemic threshold, and death rates alone do not define an epidemic.

1201,"### Context: Georgia officials, working with Governor Brian Kemp, have turned to 3D printers and National Guard units to ramp up COVID-19 testing in the state. The push for increased testing comes after Kemp lifted shelter-at-home orders and allowed businesses to reopen. However, Georgia has lagged behind other states in testing, and public health experts emphasize the importance of expanded testing to monitor for a resurgence of infections. Dr. Harry J. Heiman, a professor of public health at Georgia State University, criticizes the lack of a clear and coordinated long-term strategy at both the federal and state level. As of April 20, testing in Georgia was limited to high-risk populations, but Kemp is now encouraging anyone with flu-like symptoms to get tested, as well as essential workers who are not showing symptoms. The goal is to use every available test every day. While there have been signs of improvement, with the total number of people tested in Georgia increasing from over 84,300 on April 20 to over 183,000 by Monday, the state still ranks in the bottom 20 for per capita testing. The Georgia Department of Public Health aims to have administered over 200,000 total coronavirus tests by the end of the week. The National Guard has deployed 10 teams capable of administering 1,500 tests daily to long-term care facilities and other hotspots. However, the greatest supply shortage is the chemicals used to test the samples, called reagents. Dr. Phillip Coule, the chief medical officer for the Augusta University Medical System, states that the university cannot produce reagents and that it is limiting the number of tests that can be arranged. The article concludes by highlighting the need for more reagents to increase testing capacity in Georgia.

1202,"### Context: The article discusses the controversy surrounding Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist, and his claims of being a Vietnam veteran. In January 2019, a video went viral showing an altercation between Phillips and a group of students from Covington Catholic school wearing MAGA hats. Several news outlets initially identified Phillips as a Vietnam veteran, but later corrected their reports.

Phillips himself referred to his military service as being a ""Vietnam-times"" or ""Vietnam-era"" veteran, meaning that he served during the time of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam but was not deployed there. News outlets such as the Washington Post, CNN, and the New York Times issued corrections to their stories to clarify this.

The misinformation about Phillips' military service did not originate from him. The Indigenous Peoples Movement, a group associated with Phillips, provided incorrect information about his service to news outlets. Phillips served in the Marine Corps Reserve from June 1972 to May 1976, but he was not deployed to Vietnam. He left the service as a private after disciplinary issues.

There are conflicting statements from Phillips himself regarding his service. In some videos, he referred to himself as a ""Vietnam vet,"" while in others, he described himself as a ""Vietnam-era vet"" or referenced his Marine Corps service without mentioning Vietnam. It is unclear whether Phillips deliberately misrepresented his service or if there have been misunderstandings or misinterpretations of his statements.

The article notes that Phillips' official service records have not been obtained to verify the details of his military service. A circulated image of his DD Form 214, a discharge document, has not been verified.

In conclusion, the article states that Nathan Phillips falsely claimed to be a Vietnam veteran. While there are discrepancies and ambiguities in his statements about his military service, it is unclear whether these were intentional misrepresentations or misunderstandings.

It mentions that while there is some evidence of positive short-term effects, there is also no effect or even higher rates of distress reported in some cases. The article acknowledges the potential costs associated with the care, training, and upkeep of therapy animals, with estimates ranging from $20,000 to $30,000. It also briefly mentions the potential harms, such as immunosuppressed patients coming into contact with therapy animals and the possibility of overworking or mistreating the animals. The article highlights the shortcomings of much of the relevant literature, including small sample sizes and failure to control for other factors that may influence stress levels. It also discusses how media headlines often misstate correlation and causation. The article provides multiple links to additional material regarding the existing body of research. It cites sources from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI), a pet-industry backed organization that funds research on therapy animals. The article mentions that therapy animals are meant to extend mainstream treatments, not replace them. It also talks about the widespread use of therapy animals and provides examples. However, it does not discuss the process of obtaining a therapy animal or whether insurance would cover the cost. The article does not appear to be based on a news release. Overall, the article concludes that while therapy animals are widely used, there is a lack of concrete evidence to support their effectiveness.
Claim: Therapy animals are everywhere. Proof that they help is not.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"The story focuses on the lack of evidence supporting the fundamental concept of “therapy animals” — that interacting with animals can reduce stress or distress in humans. The story includes input from an array of expert sources and offers a broad (if vague) overview of the research literature regarding therapy animals. There are some shortcomings here — for example, not much was said about the costs of pet therapy. However, in sum, the story effectively conveys the lack of scientific consensus regarding how effective therapy animals are at reducing stress. Tackling the efficacy of therapy animals is a challenging subject, given that the story evaluates an absence of conclusive evidence. However, it’s an important subject. For example, therapy dogs can be expensive, which means a family may spend a great deal of money on a therapy animal — with little idea of whether the animal will provide meaningful benefits for a patient. Limited resources are available to help patients dealing with mental health issues, and it is important to ensure that those resources are used to achieve the maximum possible benefit. Resources that are being spent on unproven interventions are, obviously, not being used on interventions that have proven clinical benefits. This is the sort of thoughtful reporting we are always happy to see.",Therapy animals are everywhere.

The statement says the center will use the grant to help fight the AIDS epidemic both in Alabama and the Southeast. Researchers will look at social, behavioral and medical factors that contribute to HIV exposure and transmission. UAB’s office is one of 19 Centers for AIDS Research established nationwide by the National Institutes of Health. The UAB center is in his 31st year of research.

1205,"### Context: Uganda's leader, President Yoweri Museveni, is emphasizing the need to address the high infection rates of HIV among young people in the country. Despite progress in HIV treatment and availability, officials and activists are concerned that success has led to complacency. Uganda and neighboring Kenya have high AIDS rates, with issues such as low HIV testing rates among adult men, early sexual experiences among adolescents, inadequate knowledge of HIV and reproductive health, and a fear of buying condoms. President Museveni believes that officials have focused too much on treatment and wants to refocus on prevention. Africa's young people, especially girls, are among the worst affected by HIV, with girls making up 79% of new HIV infections in people ages 10 to 19 in East and southern Africa. Infection rates among young people are expected to rise as Africa's population is projected to double by 2050. In Uganda, the fear factor associated with HIV has dissipated, leading to risky sexual behavior. Condom use has declined, and the rate of HIV infection has increased among young people. The current view of AIDS as a chronic disease with available medicine has partly encouraged risky behavior. Uganda and Kenya have intensified efforts to promote self-testing for HIV. In South Africa, just 23% of young men have comprehensive knowledge about HIV. The UN is leading efforts to end the global AIDS epidemic by 2030, and the newly appointed head of the UN's AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, emphasizes the need to remove barriers and harmful social norms that leave young people, especially women, vulnerable to HIV.

### Explanation:
",true,AIDS has no cure. HIV is still here. But some people are forgetting that.,Complacency a concern as AIDS treatment improves in Africa.,"When Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni returned to power in 1986 after a bush war, he declared the country’s high HIV infection rate an “enemy of the people” and launched a campaign to fight it."
1206,"### Context: The FDA has approved the drug Amitiza for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women over 18 years old. The drug has not been approved for men due to a lack of conclusive evidence of its effectiveness. IBS is a disorder characterized by cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea, and it affects twice as many women as men. Dr. Julie Beitz of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research stated that IBS can be disabling for some people, making it difficult for them to participate in everyday activities, and Amitiza represents an important step in providing relief from their symptoms.

The safety and effectiveness of Amitiza were established in two studies involving 1,154 patients diagnosed with IBS-C (IBS with constipation). More than 90 percent of the patients in the studies were women. The studies showed that more patients treated with Amitiza reported moderate or significant relief compared to those who received a placebo. The drug was also found to have some side effects, including nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Amitiza is already approved for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation at a higher dosage of 24 micrograms twice a day. However, for the treatment of IBS-C, the recommended dosage is 8 micrograms twice a day.

The article mentions that both Takeda and Sucampo are manufacturers of Amitiza, but a spokesperson for Sucampo clarified that while both companies market the drug, Sucampo was the developer.

In summary, the FDA has approved Amitiza for the treatment of IBS in women over 18 years old. The drug has shown effectiveness in relieving symptoms of IBS-C, but its effectiveness in men has not been conclusively demonstrated. Amitiza is already approved for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation at a higher dosage. The drug has some side effects, and it is marketed by both Takeda and Sucampo, with Sucampo being the developer.

1208,"### Context: The article discusses a quote from Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, regarding the lack of testing for COVID-19. The quote has been circulating online and is being criticized for its implications regarding for-profit healthcare. The quote states, ""At $50 a test, it wasn’t enough to hire another technician to run the machine full-time. So at $100 a test, it is.""

The quote was taken from a press conference on April 16, 2020, where Dr. Birx was responding to a question about the lack of available testing for states that may not meet the Trump administration's criteria for resuming business practices. She explained that hospitals and clinics have been using point-of-care tests, leaving a significant capacity for at least a million more tests per week. However, running the larger testing machines requires a full-time technician, and at $50 a test, it wasn't financially feasible to hire another technician. But at $100 a test, it becomes profitable enough to hire additional staff.

Dr. Birx mentioned that there are tests and equipment sitting idle in labs, and they are working with each lab to determine their needs and increase testing capacity. She expressed gratitude to Administrator Seema Verma and lab directors for explaining the technical difficulties in running the equipment. By making changes bit by bit, they aim to double the testing capacity per week.

During the press conference, when asked if she would assure state governors that they could have these tests, President Donald Trump interrupted and claimed that the United States had ""tremendous testing capacity."" The press conference concluded shortly after.

In summary, Dr. Deborah Birx's quote highlights the financial challenges in increasing testing capacity for COVID-19. At $50 a test, it wasn't profitable enough to hire additional technicians, but at $100 a test, it becomes feasible. The quote has sparked criticism regarding the implications for-profit healthcare may have on testing availability.

1209,"### Context: The article discusses the claim made by Rick Scott, a former health care CEO running for governor, that his opponent, Attorney General Bill McCollum, supports embryonic stem cell research. Scott argues that he would work to ban any embryonic stem cell research in Florida. McCollum disputes this claim, calling it false. To fact-check this claim, the article examines McCollum's position on embryonic stem cell research and compares it to President Obama's position.

The article explains that embryonic stem cells are harvested from embryos created through in vitro fertilization. McCollum's position on embryonic stem cell research can be traced back to 1996 when he voted for an amendment that limited or banned federal funding for this research. However, the article notes that the amendment had loopholes that allowed for privately-funded research on existing stem cell lines.

During the 2004 elections, McCollum expressed support for increased embryonic stem cell research, stating that appropriate funding for it is a pro-life position. He also argued that embryos created at fertility clinics and intended for disposal should be used for scientific experiments to cure diseases.

In contrast, President Obama's position on embryonic stem cell research was clear during his 2008 presidential campaign. He pledged to lift the ban on federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell lines created after August 9, 2001. Obama argued that using extra embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics for research is ethical and could save lives.

The article concludes that McCollum and Obama have similar positions on embryonic stem cell research. Both support using embryos that would otherwise be destroyed for research purposes. The only difference is in funding, as McCollum voted for an amendment that limited federal funding for this research. However, he has also expressed support for appropriate funding for embryonic stem cell research.

Based on this analysis, the article rates Scott's claim that McCollum holds the same position as Obama on embryonic stem cell research as mostly true, with a slight asterisk due to the funding aspect.
Claim: Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama.
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:

1210,"### Context: The article fact-checks a statement made by Senator Jon Kyl regarding the percentage of services provided by Planned Parenthood that are related to abortion. Kyl claimed that ""well over 90 percent"" of what Planned Parenthood does is abortion services. However, Planned Parenthood states that only 3 percent of their services are abortion-related. Planned Parenthood calculates the percentages based on the number of services provided, rather than dollars spent. In 2009, they provided a total of 11,383,900 services, with abortions accounting for 332,278 procedures, which is just under 3 percent. 

The article acknowledges that there are some caveats to consider. Firstly, there is a difference between providing an abortion and providing other services like contraception or blood tests. Abortions are significant surgical procedures, while other services are quick and inexpensive. Therefore, Planned Parenthood's use of ""services"" as a measurement likely decreases the prominence of abortion compared to other measurements. If dollars spent or hours devoted to patient care were used, the percentage of abortion services would likely be higher than 3 percent. 

Secondly, the numbers provided by Planned Parenthood are self-reported, although the group claims that each affiliate's numbers are independently audited. There is no single, national audit. Despite these caveats, the article concludes that Kyl vastly overstated the share of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood. The article reached out to Kyl's office for comment but did not receive a response. However, Kyl's office later issued a statement saying that his remark was not intended to be a factual statement but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives taxpayer dollars, subsidizes abortions. 

In summary, the article fact-checks Senator Jon Kyl's claim that abortion services are ""well over 90 percent"" of what Planned Parenthood does. The article concludes that Kyl's claim is incorrect, as only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are abortion-related according to Planned Parenthood's own statistics.

1212,"### Context: Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, both Republicans from North Carolina, have announced that they will vote against Michael L. Dourson's nomination to serve as head of the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. Dourson, a toxicologist with close ties to the chemical industry, has faced opposition from environmentalists and Senate Democrats. Only one more Republican ""no"" vote would likely be needed to block his nomination. Despite lacking Senate confirmation, Dourson has been working at the EPA as a senior adviser to Administrator Scott Pruitt. The Associated Press reported in September that Dourson has accepted payments for criticizing studies that raised concerns about the safety of his clients' products. Past corporate clients of Dourson and his research group include Dow Chemical, Koch Industries, and Chevron. His research has also been funded by industry trade and lobbying groups representing plastics, pesticides, processed foods, and cigarettes.

Burr and Tillis cited Dourson's past work and concerns among their constituents about tainted drinking water in opposing his nomination. Marine veterans and their families blame contamination of wells at a North Carolina base for infant deaths and serious health problems. More recently, concerns have been raised about undisclosed discharges of chemicals into the Cape Fear River, a source of drinking water for Wilmington and other communities. Dourson worked at the EPA for over a decade and founded a nonprofit organization that evaluates chemical toxicity. His views towards industry align with other top federal regulators selected by President Trump, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

Dourson's work has often been called upon by his corporate clients when facing lawsuits. For example, DuPont hired Dourson as part of a strategy to defend themselves against accusations of polluting a West Virginia town with a toxic chemical. Dourson's team found that levels of the chemical considered safe were higher than what was found in testing of private wells. The EPA now considers much lower levels of the chemical acceptable. DuPont and its subsidiary later paid $761 million to settle lawsuits related to the chemical. Dourson's nomination has been praised by environmental advocacy groups, who argue that someone with a history of advocating for weaker safety standards should not be in charge of reviewing chemicals for the EPA.

1213,"### Context: Stacey Abrams, a potential running mate for Joe Biden, claimed in an interview that if she were the governor of Georgia, she would have handled the COVID-19 crisis differently. She stated that Georgia was one of the last states to shut down and one of the first to reopen, leading to a 40% increase in the COVID-19 rate. However, her statistic is incorrect.

Abrams relied on a post from Forbes.com, which was later withdrawn. Data from the Covid Testing Project shows that there was actually a smaller increase in the number of new cases in Georgia after the restrictions were relaxed compared to before. Georgia was one of the first states to reopen businesses, with various establishments welcoming customers from April 24. In the 12 days before the reopening, Georgia had a total of 9,695 confirmed cases. In the 12 days after, there were about 1,100 fewer confirmed cases, totaling 8,549. Overall, cases in Georgia decreased by 12% after the reopening, not increased by 40%.

Abrams' spokesperson acknowledged that accurate data is not being produced by the state of Georgia, making it difficult to determine the exact number of cases. Without reliable data, Abrams had no basis to claim a 40% increase in cases. It is also important to note that the impact of reopening businesses may not be immediately evident, as there can be a delay of up to a month or more between when a case is reported and when the infection was transmitted.

In conclusion, Stacey Abrams' claim that the COVID-19 rate in Georgia skyrocketed by 40% after reopening is incorrect. The data shows a decrease in cases after the reopening, and the impact of the policy shift may not be fully understood until several weeks later.
Claim: “Since the reopening of (Georgia), we’ve seen our COVID rate skyrocket by 40%.”

1214,"### Context: The article titled ""New hormone therapy sparks debate"" discusses the use of bioidentical hormones as a treatment for menopausal symptoms. The article does not mention the cost of bioidenticals, but it states that the cost is typically around $50 per month, similar to conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, the article criticizes the cost estimates provided by the company BodyLogicMD, stating that they are not a good benchmark for the costs of bioidentical hormone treatment.

The article highlights that there is no quantitative data provided about the safety or efficacy of bioidentical hormones. It argues that positive testimonials from physicians, celebrities, and women who have experienced fewer menopausal symptoms are not a substitute for quantitative evidence. The article also questions the claim that bioidentical hormones can be tailored to a woman's chemistry, stating that this is not proven.

The article acknowledges that bioidentical hormones are not carefully regulated by the FDA and may pose the same health risks as synthetic HRT, such as an increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease. It emphasizes that until definitive data exists, the safety of bioidentical hormones is unknown. The article also mentions that the North American Menopause Society's official position is that bioidentical hormones should not be assumed to be any safer than conventional HRT.

The article argues that menopause is a natural part of aging and does not necessarily require medical intervention. It states that unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need hormone therapy to ease menopausal symptoms. The article mentions Susan Love as an unbiased expert commenting on safety, but criticizes the inclusion of two biased experts speaking in favor of bioidentical hormones.

The article does not mention less risky lifestyle changes or evidence-based, non-hormonal pharmaceutical options for managing menopausal symptoms. It also does not provide information about where bioidentical hormones are available, although it mentions that 3,000 pharmacies in the U.S. fill orders for custom-made hormonal compounds.

Overall, the article presents bioidentical hormones as a newer option for relieving menopausal symptoms. It acknowledges that the active ingredients of these hormones are the same as those used in synthetic HRT. The article does not provide information about the sources relied upon, but it quotes several individuals, including a representative from BodyLogicMD, a company promoting bioidentical hormone therapy.
Claim: New hormone therapy sparks debate
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The story presents bioidentical hormones as a new option for relieving bothersome symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal discomfort. The story accurately reports that the active ingredients of these supposedly “natural” hormones are the same ones used in synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, these hormones are not as well-regulated or well-tested as synthetic versions. The story provides no evidence that bioidentical hormones are more effective or safer than traditional HRT. Positive testimonials from a physician employee of a bioidentical hormone supplier, a celebrity and women who have experienced reduced menopausal symptoms with  bioidentical hormones are not a substitute for quantitative evidence. The comment that a hormone product can be tailored to a woman's chemistry is not proven. Additionally, the story does not mention the cost of bioidenticals, which are typically about $50/month, similar to the cost of conventional HRT. Any physician can provide a prescription for bioidentical hormones in a routine office visit. The story appropriately stresses that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a disease which necessitates medical intervention. The story also mentions that short-term use of HRT in any form should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause. While the bioindentical hormones are marketed as a natural alternative to balancing hormones and easing bothersome symptoms of hormonal fluctuations during menopause, the story fails to mention the least risky “natural” interventions for managing symptoms of menopause, such as exercise and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats. The story also does not mention non-hormonal, evidence-based pharmaceutical options for managing symptoms.

1215,"### Context: In January 2020, televangelist Paula White faced criticism for praying for ""all satanic pregnancies to miscarry."" The controversy arose from a sermon she delivered on January 5, where she mentioned adversaries of President Donald Trump and then called on God to cause the miscarriage of babies in ""satanic wombs."" The 94-second video clip of the sermon was posted by Right Wing Watch on Twitter and gained attention from media outlets like Business Insider, CNN, and TIME magazine.

White defended herself by stating that her words were taken out of context. She claimed that she was praying Ephesians 6:12, which refers to spiritual warfare against demonic forces. White tweeted that she was praying for anything conceived by demonic plans to be canceled and not prevail in people's lives.

The video clip shows White in the middle of a stream of pronouncements, invocations, and prayers during a service at her church, the New Destiny Christian Center in Florida. However, as of January 28, the original, full-length video was no longer available on White's or the church's website or social media profiles.

The transcript of the 94-second segment reveals that White was praying against witchcraft, the marine kingdom, and any form of demonic manipulation. She also declared that satanic pregnancies should miscarry and that anything conceived in satanic wombs should not be able to carry forth any plan of destruction.

Attempts were made to reach out to Paula White Ministries for clarification on her remarks and whether she was using figurative or symbolic language. However, there was no response from her organization.

In summary, Paula White's controversial prayer for ""satanic pregnancies to miscarry"" in January 2020 sparked criticism and media attention. White defended herself by claiming her words were taken out of context and that she was praying against demonic forces.

1216,"### Context: The article discusses the case of Alec Raeshawn Smith, a 26-year-old man from Minneapolis who died because he could not afford insulin after aging out of his mother's health insurance. The article clarifies that his name was Alec, not Alex, and he died in 2017, not in 2018 as claimed in a meme. Alec had a full-time job without employer-provided health coverage, and his insulin and supplies cost almost $1,300 a month. The best health insurance plan he found would have cost him $450 a month with a $7,600 deductible, which meant he would still have to pay out-of-pocket for his medicine for many months. Due to the prohibitive cost, Alec rationed his insulin use to make it last until his next payday. This practice is not uncommon, as many people with diabetes in the US struggle to afford their insulin. The article highlights that globally, half of the people who need insulin cannot reliably access it. In the US, with 6 million insulin-dependent individuals and nearly 40% of Americans uninsured or facing high deductibles, the crisis is prevalent. Endocrinologists report that as many as one in five of their patients cannot afford their insulin, leading to emergency room visits for diabetic ketoacidosis. The article also mentions a report by the American Diabetes Association, which states that the total costs of diagnosed diabetes in the US have risen by 26% in the previous five years. People with diabetes who lack health insurance have fewer physician office visits and are prescribed fewer medications, but they have significantly more emergency department visits compared to those with insurance coverage. The case of Alec Smith highlights the human cost of rising prescription drug prices in the US and the challenges faced by individuals who cannot afford life-saving medications like insulin.

1217,"### Context: Clark County in Nevada has been ranked first in the nation for syphilis rates per capita in 2017, according to the Las Vegas Sun. The number of reported cases of syphilis in the county has been steadily increasing, with nine cases reported in 2016, 20 cases reported in 2017, and 24 cases reported in 2018, as stated by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can be cured with antibiotics if detected early.

Marlo Tonge, a communicable diseases manager at the Southern Nevada Health District, emphasized the impact of syphilis on health and the potential risks for babies if left untreated. The infection can lead to long-term complications such as meningitis, dementia, blindness, and hepatitis, as explained by Dr. Alireza Farabi from the University Medical Center.

Health department officials attribute the high syphilis rate in Clark County to the millions of international tourists who visit Las Vegas each year, contributing to the spread of various diseases. Additionally, the region has a significant population engaged in illegal and unregulated prostitution, as well as a large homeless and indigent population, both of which are at a higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Vince Collins, the director of operations at the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada, highlighted other at-risk populations, including individuals in their 20s and members of the LGBT community, particularly transgender individuals and men who have sex with men.

To address the issue, Collins emphasized the need for the community to come together and prioritize the fight against syphilis. The goal is to remove Clark County from the top spot in syphilis rates.

In summary, Clark County in Nevada has the highest syphilis rates per capita in the nation. The number of reported cases has been increasing, and the infection can lead to severe health complications if left untreated. Factors contributing to the high rate include international tourism, illegal prostitution, a large homeless population, and at-risk populations such as individuals in their 20s and the LGBT community. Efforts are being made to raise awareness and combat the spread of syphilis in the community.

1218,"### Context: State Representative Rick Saccone claimed that illegal tobacco sales, driven by high prices, have been connected to funding terrorism in several cases over the past 15 years. Saccone and other representatives raised concerns that a proposed cigarette tax increase in Pennsylvania could lead to smuggling rings that fund violent extremists. Saccone pointed to a 2015 State Department report that stated the illicit trade in tobacco products fuels transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism. David Merriman, a researcher at the University of Chicago, confirmed that high cigarette taxes/prices are associated with increased illicit sales. However, a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study found that the link between the US illicit tobacco market and terrorism appears to be minor. Out of nearly 300 tobacco cases at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) from 2002 and 2003, only eight were linked to terrorism. The study noted that the underground market evades statistical reporting and that charges of both terrorism and illicit tobacco don't always stick. Examples of domestic cigarette smuggling connected to terrorism financing post-2001 include an interstate smuggling ring in North Carolina and Michigan that operated in the late 1990s and led to multiple arrests and convictions for cigarette smuggling and assisting Hezbollah, as well as a cigarette smuggler who helped finance the trip of the Lackawanna Six, a group of Yemeni-American friends who were Al-Qaeda trainees. However, there is no systematic evidence of sustained links between the global illicit tobacco trade and terrorism. While there have been cases of illicit tobacco sales being connected to funding terrorism, the implication that American cigarette smuggling has a strong presence in terrorism financing is not supported by the evidence.

### Explanation:
",true,"Rep. Saccone said in a house session, ""Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."" Most of the trouble with this statement are its implications: American cigarette smuggling does not have strong presence in terrorism financing. Saccone himself admitted that he had heard of no such incidence in Philadelphia, where a cigarette tax bumped prices up in 2014. But, there have been cases, as he mentioned. In our research and from our correspondence with ATF, we were only able to find two groups that had financed terrorist activities through illicit tobacco sale, the Lackawanna Six and an interstate North Carolina-Michigan smuggling ring, both leading to multiple convictions.","Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half.","Saccone said, """"Illegal tobacco sales, price driven too high, has been connected to at least several cases of funding terrorism against us in multi-year investigations over the last decade and a half."""" There have been cases of illicit tobacco sales being connected to funding terrorism. But the implication that American cigarette smuggling has a strong presence in terrorism financing is not supported by the evidence.

1219,"### Context: A Facebook post claimed that students at the University of Findlay had discovered a chemical compound that kills glioblastoma cells. The post included a tweet from a WTOL reporter stating that the students had developed a compound that targets cancer cells while ignoring healthy brain tissue. The post received many comments suggesting that the government was suppressing the cure for cancer to protect pharmaceutical industry profits. However, the video accompanying the tweet clarified that the compound, known as RK-15, is still in the early stages of development and may not yet be considered a drug. The researchers at the University of Findlay are currently in the process of testing the compound on animals and plan to continue clinical testing on humans. It typically takes 10 to 15 years for a new drug to be approved by the FDA and reach patients. Medical experts noted that while the discovery is promising, it is still many years away from practical application. They also pointed out that many treatments that show promise in early stages of development often fail before being used in humans. Despite these expert opinions, the comments on the post focused on conspiracy theories and the belief that the student researchers were at risk of being silenced or killed. Local news affiliates reported on the discovery, but some readers misunderstood the stage of development and believed that the students had invented a drug ready for market. Overall, the claim that University of Findlay students discovered a chemical compound that kills glioblastoma cells is true, but it is important to note that the compound is still in the early stages of development and has not yet been tested on humans.

1220,"### Context: Law enforcement officials have confirmed that a $10 million lawsuit filed against Uber by Jason Dalton, the man accused of killing six people while working as an Uber driver in Kalamazoo, Michigan, is a hoax. Dalton, who is awaiting trial on charges related to the shootings, claimed that a ""devil"" in the Uber app took over his body and that his memories of the shootings are spotty. The handwritten letter, purportedly from Dalton, was mailed to the U.S. District Court in Detroit and filed on Tuesday. In the letter, Dalton alleges that Uber is a hostile workplace environment and discriminates against his mental health. He also claims that the company would call him late at night and threaten to fire him if he didn't go to work, although Uber does not set schedules for its drivers. However, law enforcement officials have determined that Dalton did not send the letter, did not authorize it, and does not know who sent it. The envelope containing the lawsuit was postmarked from Philadelphia, raising suspicions about its authenticity. Furthermore, the handwriting on the letter does not match Dalton's, and it was not sent in a jail envelope.

1221,"### Context: Paul Harrison, a retired trauma surgeon from Wichita, is embarking on a 1,000-mile bike trip from Wichita to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to raise awareness about eating disorders and raise funds for research for the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Harrison's daughter, Bridget, who had an IQ of over 200 and was a successful hand and reconstruction surgeon, tragically died on May 5, 2018, due to the pain caused by anorexia nervosa, depression, and anxiety. Harrison hopes to shed light on the seriousness of eating disorders and the need for more research and treatment options.

Eating disorders affect millions of people in the United States, with about 20 million women and 10 million men estimated to have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. The cause of eating disorders is multifaceted, involving biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, and pica, have the highest mortality rate of any mental health concern, with many deaths resulting from suicide.

Bridget's struggle with anorexia began when she was around 12 years old after a fellow basketball player suggested they go on a diet. From then on, her life became focused on extreme dieting and exercise, causing immense physical and mental pain. Bridget's perfectionist drive, common among individuals with eating disorders, contributed to her relentless pursuit of being the best.

Despite her own struggles, Bridget was known for her generosity and dedication to caring for others. She organized fundraisers for patients' families, volunteered at free clinics, and worked as a translator. Bridget loved traveling and had visited various countries around the world. Her family plans to spread her ashes in Spain, a place she cherished.

Bridget received treatment for her eating disorder multiple times, including hospitalizations and outpatient therapy. However, residential treatment, which is the most effective form of treatment, is often not covered by insurance. The lack of residential treatment centers for eating disorders in Kansas meant Bridget had to seek treatment out-of-state. Insurance denials for longer treatment stays and limited coverage for outpatient therapy pose significant challenges for individuals and their families.

The bike trip, called Bridget's WREATH (Wichita to Winnipeg Ride for Eating Disorder Awareness), aims to raise $100,000 for NEDA. The trip serves as a way for Harrison, his brother, and their friend to reflect on Bridget's life and the pain she endured. They hope that future research and treatment options will help prevent others from suffering the same fate.

If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, resources and information can be found at the National Eating Disorders Association's website.

1222,"### Context: The article discusses the potential benefits of Vascepa, a fish oil capsule produced by Amarin, for cardiovascular patients. The article highlights that the price of Vascepa is lower than indicated by online searches, but it does not provide information on the baseline risk of participants, which is crucial in determining the true size of the benefit. The article also notes that the company is withholding details about the study results, making it impossible to judge the importance of the results. The study outcome includes various cardiovascular events, but it is unclear whether there was a reduction in deaths, heart attacks, or strokes. The article does not mention important warnings about possible allergic reactions or interactions with anti-clotting drugs. The quality of the evidence is also questioned due to the lack of key details about the trial. The article includes comments from experts, but it fails to mention that one of the sources received significant payments from Amarin. The article compares the results of the Vascepa trial to other cholesterol drugs, but the comparison is deemed unreliable due to the unknowns about the cardiovascular events in patients taking Vascepa. The article concludes that it is difficult to report on a drug trial when critical details are not released by the sponsors.
Claim: Amarin fish oil capsule shows dramatic benefit for cardiovascular patients, potentially upending market
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"A 25% reduction in cardiovascular events, including death, heart attack or stroke sounds like a big deal… and maybe it is. But this story about the results of a trial of a prescription drug derived from fish oil (brand name Vascepa) relies on a news release and company statements that don’t provide basic information about the precise number or type of cardiovascular events observed by researchers. Without absolute numbers, it is impossible to judge the importance of these results. It is also premature to claim that the results represent “heart-medicine history,” especially given that the findings haven’t been peer-reviewed and are at odds with numerous previous studies. The story takes a cheerleading tone and fails to supply key context. For example, it highlights a dramatic quote from a researcher without noting that he was paid over $120,000 by the drug company, including payments for speeches and other appearances on its behalf, in 2017. The story headline and text do make clear that only patients with cardiovascular disease and high levels of triglycerides or diabetes were in the trial, so it should be clear to readers that this drug was not shown to prevent disease in healthy people. The story does not give any details about potential harms of the drug. It reports key details of the trial, but without access to the full trial report, it is impossible to judge the quality of the evidence or its real significance. This story is based on the news release claim of a 25% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events. But what does that mean? It’s difficult to say, because that outcome consists of a combination of cardiovascular disease death, heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization procedures (placing a stent in a blocked artery) and hospitalization for unstable angina (chest pain). Based on what little we know, it is possible that the 25% reduction was driven mainly by a lower rate of hospitalizations for chest pain — an outcome that’s less important and also more subject to bias on the part of investigators who decide which patients get hospitalized and which ones don’t. It’s possible there was little or no reduction in deaths, heart attacks or strokes. Until the full trial results are released, we simply don’t know.","Amarin fish oil capsule shows dramatic benefit for cardiovascular patients, potentially upending market","This story reports on a drug trial for Vascepa, a fish oil capsule.

1225,"### Context: A new study suggests that flashing night-lights may help reduce jet lag and circadian problems. The study found that a series of flashes delivered every 10 seconds over a 60-minute period delayed sleepiness by two hours, compared to a 36-minute delay for those exposed to continuous light for an hour. The researchers believe that using this flashing light therapy the night before traveling could help synchronize the circadian system and reduce the effects of jet lag. The study also indicated that the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality. However, an outside observer, Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, cautioned that mistiming light therapy can make jet lag worse and that further research and independent verification are needed before this therapy can be considered safe and effective. The article also mentions that jet lag is a self-resolving nuisance syndrome and that the technology for flashing night-lights is still in development, beyond just a smartphone. The article rates the evidence as satisfactory, as it includes cautionary advice from an independent source and acknowledges the need for further research. It also mentions previous research carried out by the team, indicating that the technique is not entirely novel. Overall, the article suggests that flashing night-lights may have potential benefits for reducing jet lag and circadian problems, but more research is needed before it can be recommended for use.
Claim: Flashing night-lights may help lessen jet lag, circadian problems
The claim veracity: true

### Explanation:
",true,"This study of flashing light therapy enrolled 39 people, and exposed 31 of them to a series of two-millisecond light flashes with changing intervals while sleeping. The other eight were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light. Those who experienced the flashing light were more quickly able to alter their circadian clock and thus, in theory, more quickly adapt to a new time zone. The report covered the main bases found in the published research and, unlike a CNN article on the same study, included the helpful commentary of an outside observer who was able to add context to the meaning and impact of the study. Jet lag is a significant concern for many people who have to travel distances that span multiple time zones, where their ability to work effectively is compromised as the body struggles to adjust to a new time zone. This means a simple, but effective light therapy session could bring much-needed relief to those who have to travel but also, possibly, to those who do shift work and are frequently forced into combat against the body’s natural circadian rhythms. People who work in important jobs where alertness and quick adaptability to changing sleep schedules are required (airline pilots, doctors, nurses, ambulance attendants, truck drivers, etc) may benefit from such a therapy.","Flashing night-lights may help lessen jet lag, circadian problems","This is a news release about a study that looked at the effects of flashing light on the circadian rhythms of 10 healthy men. The study found that flashing light at night delayed sleep onset by about 36 minutes, while flashing light at night delayed sleep onset by about 2 hours. The release does a good job of explaining the study and its limitations, and it includes a cautionary note from an independent source. The release would have been stronger if it had mentioned that the technology is still in development and that the researchers have done previous work in this area.

1226,"### Context: Missouri is facing vaccination hesitancy amid a recent measles case. The reappearance of diseases like measles in the US has prompted national alarm and calls for increased vaccination. The World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy as a threat to global health, citing complacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines, and lack of confidence as key reasons for hesitancy. Missouri ranks 21st in vaccination rates for children ages 19 months to under age 3. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination is typically administered during this age range. Measles can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation, seizures, and permanent brain damage if left untreated. The CDC has reported an annual increase in measles cases, with 372 cases reported in 2018. Missouri has introduced bills to eliminate religious belief exemptions and allow minors to consent to vaccinations, while opposing bills aim to prohibit discrimination against unvaccinated children and require informational paperwork for parents. Measles outbreaks are increasing among unvaccinated children in states that allow personal belief exemptions, such as Washington and Texas. An Arizona legislative panel has voted to expand its exemption list, raising concerns about potential measles outbreaks. A 10-year Danish study of 10,000 children released in March found no relationship between MMR vaccination and autism, debunking the discredited 1998 study that linked the vaccine to autism. Major websites like Facebook, Pinterest, and Google have taken steps to remove vaccine misinformation, but the problem persists. Building trust between parents and healthcare providers is crucial in reversing the trend of vaccine hesitancy. Honest conversations with doctors, addressing specific concerns with scientific evidence, and engaging parents offline are key strategies to combat misinformation and promote vaccination.

1227,"### Context: The pollution in Afghanistan may be more deadly than the ongoing war, according to a research group called State of Global Air. While there are no official statistics on the number of deaths caused by pollution-related illnesses, the group estimated that over 26,000 deaths in 2017 could be attributed to pollution, compared to 3,483 civilian deaths in the war. Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, has become one of the most polluted cities in the world, with a constant smog and smoke covering the city. The pollution is caused by factors such as old vehicles, electrical generators, burning of coal, garbage, plastic, and rubber, as well as poor sanitation systems and garbage piled on roadsides and sidewalks. The majority of victims are poisoned by the air in their own homes, as families burn whatever they can to keep warm during the harsh winters. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. The article highlights the case of a man named Yousuf, who lives in a camp for displaced people and burns garbage for warmth and cooking. His children have suffered from chest infections and other illnesses due to the pollution, and many have died before the age of seven. The camp lacks proper water and sanitation systems and is surrounded by garbage dumps. The government of Afghanistan has launched a program to control old vehicles, a significant source of pollution, and has called on residents to stop burning garbage for heat. However, fuel is expensive and often unavailable for many people in Kabul. Doctors at a children's hospital in Kabul have seen an increase in patients with pollution-related illnesses, particularly during the winter. The government has also launched an environmental awareness campaign to educate the public about the harm of pollution and steps to reduce it. However, there is a need for the state to take further action, such as encouraging tree planting and creating green spaces, as well as implementing a city master plan to address unplanned development and lack of services. The decades of war in Afghanistan have worsened the environmental damage and made it difficult to prioritize environmental issues.

The range in costs for these procedures is wide, and insurance does not cover them unless medically necessary. The benefits of the procedures are mentioned but not adequately quantified. The article acknowledges the harms associated with penile extenders, but suggests that more hard numbers should have been provided for the risks of other enhancement procedures. The study design is described as a retrospective review of the literature, but the article lacks discussion on the study's limitations. The story avoids disease-mongering and explains that most men seeking penile enhancement are average. However, it does not delve into the medicalization of dysmorphophobias, which could have been explored further. The article uses independent sources, but one of the sources is a penile enhancement practitioner. It also fails to mention that one of the study's co-authors has ties to a company that produces a penile traction device. The article briefly mentions cognitive behavioral therapy as a potential alternative for men seeking to feel better about their body type or perceived sexual inadequacy. It suggests that surgical procedures are performed by urologists and plastic surgeons, but does not provide additional information on the availability of traction methods or the frequency of these procedures. The article concludes by stating that it adequately explains that it is reporting on a retrospective review of past studies and does not rely on a news release.
Claim: When Size Matters, Men Can Turn to Penile Extenders: Study
The claim veracity: mixture

### Explanation:
",mixture,"The lack of cost information was a significant hole in the story, and there was no discussion of the limitations of the study or alternatives to treatment, especially given that the consensus in this story appears to be that most men with dissatisfaction about their penis size are suffering from a perception problem, not a physical problem. With some of these improvements, the story could have provided a much better service to readers. There’s a lesson in this story for journalists to do a better job checking conflicts of interests in sources. The story didn’t disclose that one of the authors has conducted research on a penile traction device and is quoted on the company’s advertising materials. Penile enhancement — along with hair replacement — is one of the most popular medical interventions targeted at men, and it is often the purview of medical providers outside the mainstream. Because men who perceive themselves as being sexually inadequate are particularly vulnerable to aggressive marketing about ostensible cures, it is especially important to evaluate the claims being made by plastic surgeons and the like. This story does a decent job doing just that.

The story notes there was no difference in the diagnostic value of the two approaches but does note a difference in time and costs. The story provides a somewhat confusing and overly complicated picture of the risks of the CT scans without putting the risks into context with the standard diagnostic procedures. While there is a detailed listing of radiation exposure to the CT scan, no information is provided on the burden of the standard testing. Noting the radiation exposure in millisieverts without comparative information does little to inform the reader of the relative risks of the two approaches studied. The link between radiation exposure and the risk of developing cancer is perhaps beyond the scope of the story. A simple citation (for example – http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MedicalX-Rays/ucm115329.htm ) would have helped the readers better understand the size of the risk.
