## PUBHEALTH fact-checking dataset

The PUBHEALTH dataset provides automated fact-checking of public health claims that are explainable. In the PUBHEALTH dataset, each instance has a veracity label (true, false, unproven, mixture). Additionally, each instance in the dataset has an explanation text field. The explanation is a justification for why a particular veracity label has been given to the claim.
