0,Drinking one diet drink a day triples a person's risk of dementia and strokes.,"High-sugar beverages such as soda are uncontroversially unhealthy, and their regular consumption is causally associated with a variety of adverse health conditions, including coronary heart disease and diabetes. The recognition of this association has led to an increase in the popularity of beverages with alternative sweeteners. The health effects of artificially sweetened products are less clearly understood and remain an active area of research, which unfortunately for rational scientific discourse means the topic also makes for effective clickbait and scare claims. One example of that phenomenon comes from the website “Skinny and Healthy,” which posted an article headlined “Drinking One Diet Drink Daily Can Triple Risk of Dementia and Stroke.” Like most citation-free science clickbait, that article primarily consisted of a copy-pasted press release, in this case for a 2017 study published in the journal Stroke which has been reframed in a way to suggest that the results were more authoritative than they actually were: Remember that we are what we eat. Sugary drinks are bad, but diet drinks can even be more dangerous! Drinking One Diet Drink A Day Can Triple Risk Of Dementia And Strokes. Bad for our body and our brain too … Boston University researchers found aspartame, a low-calorie sweetener, wreaks havoc on the arteries — as opposed to sugar-sweetened drinks. This means drinking diet soda is far worse for your health than drinking regular soda sweetened with sugar. The results showed that adults who had one or more diet drinks a day were 2.9 times more likely to develop dementia and 3 times more at risk of strokes compared to those who virtually had none at all. Most important is that the study did not indicate that “diet drinks can even be more dangerous” than regular ones, or that the action of drinking a soda sweetened with artificial sweeteners causes an increased risk of stroke or dementia. That study did broadly find that “drinking at least one artificially sweetened beverage daily was associated with almost three times the risk of developing stroke or dementia compared to those who drank artificially-sweetened beverages less than once a week,” but the study was not designed to address causation and did not make any argument regarding it. “The authors caution that the long-term observational study was not designed or able to prove cause and effect, and only shows a trend among one group of people,” the press release also stated. The study authors utilized data from a well-known dataset, the “Framingham Heart Study”, which included questionnaires about food preferences with other health indicators taken from people at multiple times over the course of decades: The Framingham Heart Study comprises a series of community-based prospective cohorts originating from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. We studied the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, which commenced in 1971 with the enrollment of 5124 volunteers. Participants have been studied across 9 examination cycles approximately every 4 years, with the latest cycle concluding in 2014. We estimated the 10-year risk of both incident stroke and dementia beginning from the 7th examination cycle (1998–2001). An editorial written to accompany the study raised the possibility of selection biases that could have driven at least some of the associations documented, however. For example, it could be that people with existing risk factors for the cardiovascular issues that lead to stroke and dementia make a switch to artificially sweetened beverages for other health reasons and carry their increased risks with them: People at increased risk of vascular events because of preexisting vascular risk factors may switch from regular to diet soft drinks in an attempt to control weight and insulin resistance. It is entirely possible that the intake of [artificially sweetened beverages] starts after the cardiovascular risk is increased and, therefore, is a marker of a high-risk profile rather than being a causal risk factor for stroke or dementia. The 2017 study in Stroke also found, as alluded in the viral reports, that people who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages did not see an increase in the risk of stroke or dementia. This also could be the result of a form of selection bias stemming from the fact that the population most at risk from their sugary beverage consumption may have already died, affecting the statistical analysis: [The finding of no increased stroke or dementia risk from sugar sweetened beverages] could be attributed to selection bias, such that particularly vulnerable participants, that is, long-term [sugar sweetened beverages] consumers with a very high cardiovascular risk died earlier. This could also explain the lower-risk profile of high [sugar-sweetened beverage] consumers compared with high [artificially-sweetened beverage] consumers, the data of which were collected in 1998 to 2001. This 2017 study is not the only one to tackle the topic of adverse health outcomes from the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages. Other studies have looked at this and similar questions and reached differing conclusions: The Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study reported that greater consumption of sugar- and artificially sweetened soft drinks was each independently associated with a higher risk of incident stroke over 28 years of follow-up for women and 22 years of follow-up for men. The Northern Manhattan Study, a population-based multiethnic cohort, reported that daily consumption of artificially sweetened soft drink was associated with a higher risk of combined vascular events but not stroke when examined as an independent outcome. A 2012 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also documented an association between low-calorie beverages and stroke but argued the results should be interpreted with caution, as no clear biological mechanism explained a link between low-calorie sweeteners and the circulatory issues that lend themselves to strokes: Our finding of an association between low-calorie soda intake and stroke risk should be interpreted with caution, because we previously did not find an association between low-calorie beverages and weight gain, diabetes, or [Coronary Artery Disease], and there is not a clear biologic mechanism between low-calorie soda consumption and incident stroke. That study, in contrast to the 2017 paper, found in increased risk of stroke for sugar-sweetened beverage drinkers as well. While the 2017 study at issue here also found an association between stroke and artificially sweetened beverages, its authors pointed to uncertainties regarding what possible mechanism might link artificially sweetened beverages to either stroke or dementia, describing possible links as “incompletely understood.” Ultimately, clinical trials and not prospective cohort studies like the ones that have been used to address this question in the past will be needed to investigate causation and tease apart any possible mechanism that might exist, a point the authors of the 2017 study in Stroke made explicitly: Clinical trials are needed to establish whether the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is causally related to dementia or surrogate end points, such as cognitive decline or brain atrophy … Given that clinical trials involving stroke end points are large and costly, clinical trials should investigate whether artificially sweetened beverages are associated with important stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure.",unproven,"Some studies show an association between increased consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and stroke or dementia risk, but that does not mean one causes the other.","

The claim that drinking one diet drink a day triples a person's risk of dementia and strokes is unproven.

2,"Mike Coffman Says state Sen. Morgan Carroll's votes made ""it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first.","Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman pulls no punches in an ad accusing his Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her ""shady interests"" as a trial lawyer. ""Meet Morgan Carroll, state senator, who’s also Morgan Carroll, personal injury lawyer,"" the narrator says in the ad that aired Sept. 20. ""Morgan Carroll the lawyer has worked for some of the sleaziest firms in the state. And they love frivolous lawsuits."" The ad shows photos of Carroll on billboards next to slimy-looking lawyers. The narrator says the state senator’s votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."" Coffman’s radio version of the ad goes further, accusing Carroll of ""using her position in the state Senate to line her own pockets"" and speaking about an ""odor of corruption,"" the Denver Post reported. We took a hard look at Coffman’s TV ad claim that Carroll's votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses""to serve her ""shady interests."" Carroll became an attorney in 2000, and spent the first decade of her career working with her mother. Their firm mostly represented clients with disabilities, Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich told PolitiFact. In an ad of her own, Carroll recalls that she was a girl when her dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and she watched him get sicker as medical costs wiped out his retirement savings. ""It's why I've dedicated my career to fighting for people with disabilities, helping people stay in their homes and receive the care they need,"" she says. More recently, Carroll worked for two big personal injury law firms whose TV commercials are well-known to Coloradans. She spent two years at the Sawaya Law Firm, then moved to Bachus & Schanker. The Bachus & Schanker website says, ""Morgan Carroll specializes in representing people in personal injury, Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability and employment law."" Godinich said Carroll primarily was doing legal research at the firm until about four months ago when she took time off to devote herself to the race against Coffman for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, a crescent-ring of Denver suburbs. The Coffman ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. One of them is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman says Carroll opposed to make it ""easier to sue""doctors and nurses. The Republican-sponsored bill granted immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics to help people in need. The Coffman ad is misleading. Carroll, who at the time was a House member, voted against the bill in committee after she and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association raised concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield a medical professional when a patient was harmed by gross negligence. However, Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to grant immunity to medical volunteers from civil liability when an ""act or omission of a volunteer"" resulted in injury, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct and even violent crimes -- acts that would prevent a volunteer from receiving immunity under the federal Volunteer Protection Act. Ultimately, Carroll supported passage of the law that made it harder -- not easier -- to sue volunteer doctors, nurses and other health-medical professionals -- unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Coffman’s claim that Carroll made it easier to sue small businesses, refers to the ""Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013. ""Carroll was a primary sponsor of the bill. State law already allowed someone who prevailed in a complaint about employment discrimination or unfair employment practices before the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to sue for back pay, future pay, or to be reinstated or hired if they were improperly fired or denied a job. Carroll’s bill allowed victims of employment discrimination who win a lawsuit to also receive compensatory and punitive damages in cases where it was proved an employer engaged in intentional discrimination. In addition, the bill allowed an employee to be awarded attorney’s fees and costs. But if a judge found a lawsuit was frivolous -- or unjustified -- the court could award attorney’s fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages at $10,000 for a business with fewer than five employees, and $25,000 for an employer with five to 14 workers, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council’s fiscal analysis. The bill and the Legislative Council noted that while federal antidiscrimination laws allow compensatory and punitive damages, those laws don’t protect workers who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or if their employer has fewer than 15 employees. Carroll’s state bill allowed people to seek the increased damages when their employer had less than 15 employees or there was discrimination based on sexual orientation. So the legislation, which became law, didn’t make it ""easier to sue"" small businesses -- people could already do that -- but it did allow people the opportunity to win greater financial damages. What about Coffman’s accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer? We checked the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission’s records and found no evidence of an ethics complaint having been made against Carroll. The Legislature’s ethics rules state that a lawmaker has a personal or financial interest in legislation ""if the passage or failure of such bill, measure, or question will result in the member deriving a direct financial or pecuniary benefit that is greater than any such benefit derived by or shared by other persons in the member's profession, occupation, industry, or region."" But a lawmaker will not be deemed to have a personal or financial interest in a bill that ""affects the entire membership of a class to which the member belongs."" In a part-time ""citizen legislature"" like Colorado’s, this generally allows a doctor/lawmaker to vote on a health care bill, a teacher to vote on an educational bill, and a builder to vote on a construction bill. Our ruling Coffman says Carroll’s votes on state legislation made ""it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first.""

It is not clear from the story if the blood test results in better outcomes for the patient other than convenience and fewer side effects. The question of whether using the blood test in combination with treatment results in better outcomes for the patient is unanswered. The story only mentions one harm of the blood test – getting the blood drawn itself. The story should have mentioned other harms such as what happens with false positive or negative results or how the results may be misinterpreted by non-allergy specialist clinicians.

The story should have mentioned other harms such as what happens with false positive or negative results or how the results may be misinterpreted by non-allergy specialist clinicians. The story does not describe the strength of the available evidence to support the use of the blood test. Specifically, no data are presented on whether more diagnostic testing will result in better outcomes. The story commits disease mongering by not emphasizing that the blood and skin tests are only used in those with severe allergies. Most people with common pet or seasonal allergies will not require this kind of testing. Furthermore, the story overstates the risk that children with allergies have of developing respiratory problems and asthma later on. The story quotes multiple experts. The story mentions the skin testing and talking with their primary care doctors about their symptoms as alternatives to the blood test. The story does say that the test is available and comments that its use is limited in the U.S. The story does state that the blood tests were developed in the 1970s but that newer tests have become available more recently. Because the story quotes multiple experts, the reader can assume the story does not rely on a press release as the sole source of information.
