0,0,12405,Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries.,"California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and candidate for governor in 2018, claimed on Twitter that ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries."" To support this claim, Newsom's campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in 2016, which compared gun homicide rates in the United States to 22 other high-income countries. The study found that the rate of gun homicides in the United States was 25.2 times higher than in the other countries. When considering all types of gun deaths, including homicides, accidental shootings, and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries. The co-authors of the study confirmed that Newsom's claim was accurate. They described the study as ""purely an academic study"" and stated that anyone who looks at the data would agree with Newsom's claim. However, another study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found a slightly lower gun homicide rate in the United States compared to the American Journal of Medicine study. This discrepancy was due to the inclusion of countries like Turkey and Chile, which have relatively high gun homicide rates, in the United Nations study but not in the American Journal of Medicine report. Overall, Newsom's claim is supported by the American Journal of Medicine study, which found that the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times higher than in other developed countries. However, the inclusion of additional information from the United Nations study would have provided a more complete picture of the gun homicide rate in the United States compared to other nations. Therefore, while Newsom's statement is accurate, it could benefit from clarification or additional information.",true,"Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries."" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

The study initially focused on differences in brain volume between healthy women and women with preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. The researchers assumed that the brains of women with preeclampsia would swell, but they found that they actually shrank. This led them to conclude that brain shrinkage is a normal feature of pregnancy, rather than a symptom of preeclampsia. The study's sample size was limited and not intended to be representative of the general population. A review paper from 2016, which searched for studies on changes in brain structure during pregnancy, did not find any subsequent studies that replicated or attempted to replicate the 2002 study. The claim suggests that the finding of pregnant brain shrinkage has resonated on the internet because it provides a simple explanation for the mental cloudiness or forgetfulness that some women experience during pregnancy. However, the mechanism and physiological importance of these findings are speculative, and the research does not demonstrate an actual decline in mental capacity.

The article explains that while Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them. The starting point is that Washington's school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The standards included requirements for milk, whole grains, and sodium levels. Perdue's new rules give schools more time to comply with the standards for whole grains and sodium levels, and also expand the rules for milk. The article argues that while the standards themselves have not been changed, schools are now allowed to not follow them. The article compares this to saying that the posted speed limits on roads remain the same, but drivers can go as fast as they want. Perdue's office sent out a press release entitled ""Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again,"" which stated that the department would start the process to allow schools to serve 1 percent flavored milk.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Costa Rica competes with countries like India, Brazil, Panama, and Mexico for medical tourists, and its proximity to the United States gives it an advantage over Asian and South American destinations. While some doctors in the United States discourage traveling abroad for cheaper treatment, the technology and care standards in the private sector in Costa Rica are perceived to be high.

Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: Medical tourism is on the rise in Costa Rica, with a growing number of North Americans traveling to the country for medical care. The lower prices in Costa Rica are a major draw for these medical tourists, who contribute close to 0.8 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Last year, around 40,000 medical tourists visited Costa Rica, with most of them coming from the United States and Canada. Of that number, nearly 15,000 traveled for dental care. The dental tourism niche is booming in Costa Rica and is expected to account for 50 percent of all medical tourism in the country within the next two years. The total amount spent on medical tourism in Costa Rica in 2011 was $280 million, compared to $252 million in 2010. Costa Rica competes with countries like India, Brazil, Panama, and Mexico for medical tourists, and its proximity to the United States gives it an advantage over Asian and South American destinations. While some doctors in the United States discourage traveling abroad for cheaper treatment, the technology and care standards in the private sector in Costa Rica are perceived to be high. However, the healthcare reform in the United States that will require Americans to get basic insurance by 2014 could reduce the demand for medical tourism. The dental tourism industry in Costa Rica is particularly popular, with tourists representing 70 percent of one dentist's business. Most medical tourists are uninsured and pay for their own treatment. Some insurance companies in the United States, such as Cigna Corp, Satori, and Blue Cross Blue Shield, are expanding their supplier network to include overseas clinics and facilities to help cut costs. Costa Rican health officials are working to handle the booming demand for medical tourism and are encouraging investors to build new clinics and hospitals to meet the needs of tourist-patients.

14,14,8518,Gaza resumes coronavirus testing amid shortages.,"Health officials in Gaza have resumed testing for the coronavirus after running out of testing kits earlier this month. The testing kits, which were donated by the World Health Organization (WHO), will be able to test approximately 500 people in the densely populated territory of two million. However, officials have stated that they are in need of thousands of testing kits to effectively carry out testing on a regular basis. Gaza currently has 13 confirmed cases of the virus, all of which are in quarantine. The shortage of testing kits in Gaza has raised concerns about the potential rapid spread of the virus in the territory. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for over a decade, which has limited the availability of medical supplies and equipment. However, Israeli and Palestinian officials have stated that Israel is cooperating with the international community to maintain public health in Gaza. In addition to the testing kits, Israel has allowed a PCR machine into the territory. This machine, donated by a U.S.-based charity, is used to analyze testing samples and determine if they contain the genetic fingerprint of the coronavirus. Health officials in Gaza are hopeful that they will be able to purchase a larger quantity of testing kits in the coming week. This is particularly important as hundreds of Palestinians stranded outside of Gaza are expected to return home and will require testing upon arrival. These individuals will then be sent to quarantine facilities in the southern Gaza Strip for three weeks. To prevent the spread of the virus, Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, has implemented several measures including the closure of schools, mosques, and wedding halls, as well as the banning of large street gatherings. However, they have not yet imposed a lockdown, stating that it is not yet necessary. In summary, Gaza has resumed coronavirus testing after facing a shortage of testing kits.

Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: The cases announced Wednesday occurred in Uinta and Park counties around the second week of September. Wyoming Department of Health spokeswoman Kim Deti says both people were hospitalized. The illnesses are prompting the department and Gov. Mark Gordon to warn people to avoid vaping products containing THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. Symptoms of vaping illness include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, vomiting and diarrhea. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports over 1,600 lung injury cases and 34 deaths nationwide. About 80 percent of cases involve THC use.

16,16,10830,Gene Therapy Cures Adult Leukemia,"The article discusses a study on gene therapy that has shown promising results in curing adult leukemia. The study involved three patients, two of whom were in full remission and one in partial remission. However, the article criticizes the use of the term ""cure"" in the headline and throughout the story, as it is a loaded term that can create confusion. The article also highlights the importance of addressing the unknowns and uncertainties surrounding the treatment. The article acknowledges that in a three-person study, it is difficult to quantify the harms or benefits beyond describing what happened to each patient. It praises the article from WebMD for presenting the side effects of the treatment and how they may have affected its effectiveness. The article also commends WebMD for evaluating the quality of the evidence and providing more qualifiers for the findings. Both the WebMD article and the Reuters article could have used more outside sources, as they both only quoted one outside source. The article from WebMD was criticized for having an overly effusive outside source, while the Reuters article was praised for tempering some of the enthusiasm with a realistic assessment of the treatment's prospects. The article also highlights an important comparison that the WebMD article made regarding bone marrow transplants. It states that a risky bone marrow transplant is required for a cure, but there is a 20% chance of not surviving the treatment and only a 50-50 chance of a cure even if the patient does survive. The article explains that the gene therapy treatment involves genetically engineered cells called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which have been shown to kill cancer in the test tube but die away before doing much damage to tumors in humans. The addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB in the current treatment has made the CAR T cells more potent and allowed them to persist and multiply in patients' bodies without causing harmful immune attacks. Overall, the article praises the WebMD article for providing more information and context about the study, but criticizes both articles for relying heavily on patient quotes from a university news release.",true,"Despite an incorrect headline and some overly effusive quotes, this story outperformed the competition from Reuters in presenting the findings from a very small but promising study into a new treatment for the most prevalent form of leukemia. The story broke down the science behind the study in clear terms, explored the side effects of the treatment and painted a realistic picture of the difficulties in translating these initial findings into a clinical therapy. We wish the story had avoided phrases such as “amazing success” and “absolutely dramatic,” even in quotes. Some of these descriptors were over-the-top compared to most of the content of the story. It declares “Gene Therapy Cures Adult Leukemia,” while in the story itself it says, “Doctors hate to declare a cure until patients have been cancer-free for at least five years.” As noted by both of the stories we reviewed, researchers have been trying to find a way to use genetically engineered cells to fight cancer for 20 years, making even a small study like this interesting news. Both stories sounded some cautionary notes, but WebMD did a better job overall of helping readers see that the study’s findings were promising but not proof that a cure for leukemia is around the corner. This makes the WebMD headline all the more unfortunate because the body of the story is full of much more specific and relevant information.","The article discusses a study on gene therapy that has shown promising results in curing adult leukemia.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex.

At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Democrats in Maine legalized female genital mutilation is false. Female genital mutilation has been illegal across the United States since 1996. The article explains that the claim is based on a recent vote in the Maine legislature regarding a bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law in addition to the existing federal law. However, the Senate and the House of Representatives in Maine failed to agree on the text of the bill, and the measure died at the end of the session on April 18. The failure of the bill does not mean that Maine will now allow female genital mutilation. The article mentions that the debate over the bill had been highly charged for months. The Southern Poverty Law Center published emails in February between a Republican representative and a group called ACT for America, which the SPLC has designated as a hate group. ACT for America claims to have helped pass female genital mutilation legislation in nine states, along with legislation banning Sharia Law and protecting those who report suspicious activity. The American Civil Liberties Union also weighed in on an early version of the bill, stating that it was an attempt to single out behavior attributed to certain religious and ethnic communities. According to the women's advocacy group Equality Now, as of September 2017, 26 states had enacted legislation criminalizing female genital mutilation in addition to the federal ban. These state laws vary in terms of the age range they cover and the allowance for cultural defense. In conclusion, the claim that Democrats in Maine legalized female genital mutilation is false. The bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law did not pass, and female genital mutilation remains illegal across the United States.

19,19,2326,Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.,"A review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization has found that among 73 lower and middle-income nations, only four have adequate resources in place to provide necessary care for women and newborns. The four countries are Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Jordan. The review states that more than three-quarters of the countries face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, relieving pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths, and 289,000 maternal deaths, with over 92 percent of these deaths occurring in the countries reviewed. Many of these countries lack the necessary infrastructure and regulatory systems to train midwives adequately. Data collection is also a problem. The report emphasizes the importance of women and girls' right to maternal and reproductive health and calls for a change in the current situation. The lack of midwifery services is not only a health crisis but also an economic one. Boosting midwifery services can reduce costly cesarean births, saving up to $128.5 million over three decades. Bangladesh is one country that has made some progress in training midwives, although birth-related mortality remains high.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin).

21,21,29256,Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients.,"The claim that Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients is not entirely accurate. In 2016, the website Natural News published an article discussing a legal battle between the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) and PepsiCo. The CEH had raised concerns about the levels of a chemical called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products, which exceeded the legal limits imposed by California's Proposition 65. 4-MEI is a byproduct of the caramel coloring process used in soft drinks like cola. The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) released a study in 2007 suggesting that high doses of 4-MEI may cause lung cancer in mice and leukemia in rats. Based on this study, California added 4-MEI to its Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have different views on the potential cancer risk of 4-MEI. The EFSA found that the levels of 4-MEI Europeans were exposed to through food consumption were lower than those that would raise concerns. The FDA stated that there is no immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food. After 4-MEI was added to Proposition 65, the CEH found that some Pepsi and Coca-Cola products exceeded the allowable limits. Both companies announced their intent to reduce 4-MEI levels in their sodas to comply with California law. Subsequent testing showed that Pepsi had not changed their formulations outside of California, leading the CEH to continue their legal efforts against PepsiCo. In September 2015, PepsiCo and the CEH settled their dispute. Pepsi agreed to require its ingredient suppliers to meet strict limits on 4-MEI levels and to test its cola products to ensure compliance. However, the settlement did not require PepsiCo to admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The consent judgment explicitly stated that PepsiCo did not admit to violating any law or accepting 4-MEI's classification as a carcinogen. In summary, while there were concerns about the levels of 4-MEI in Pepsi and Coca-Cola products, PepsiCo did not admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients.

It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription.

Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: The claim that Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients is not entirely accurate. In 2016, the website Natural News published an article discussing a legal battle between the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) and PepsiCo. The CEH had raised concerns about the levels of a chemical called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products, which exceeded the legal limits imposed by California's Proposition 65. 4-MEI is a byproduct of the caramel coloring process used in soft drinks like cola. The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) released a study in 2007 suggesting that high doses of 4-MEI may cause lung cancer in mice and leukemia in rats. Based on this study, California added 4-MEI to its Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have different views on the potential cancer risk of 4-MEI. The EFSA found that the levels of 4-MEI Europeans were exposed to through food consumption were lower than those that would raise concerns. The FDA stated that there is no immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food. After 4-MEI was added to Proposition 65, the CEH found that some Pepsi and Coca-Cola products exceeded the allowable limits. Both companies announced their intent to reduce 4-MEI levels in their sodas to comply with California law. Subsequent testing showed that Pepsi had not changed their formulations outside of California, leading the CEH to continue their legal efforts against PepsiCo. In September 2015, PepsiCo and the CEH settled their dispute. Pepsi agreed to require its ingredient suppliers to meet strict limits on 4-MEI levels and to test its cola products to ensure compliance. However, the settlement did not require PepsiCo to admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The consent judgment explicitly stated that PepsiCo did not admit to violating any law or accepting 4-MEI's classification as a carcinogen. In summary, while there were concerns about the levels of 4-MEI in Pepsi and Coca-Cola products, PepsiCo did not admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The settlement between PepsiCo and the CEH focused on ensuring compliance with California's Proposition 65 regulations.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: Maulanasyah, a barber in Bogor, Indonesia, has taken extreme measures to protect himself and his customers from the coronavirus. He wears a plastic sheet held together with tape, a ski mask, a gas mask, and latex gloves while working at his salon. He has been wearing this protective gear for the past two weeks as a way to show appreciation to health workers and to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Before starting any haircuts, Maulanasyah sprays his protective gear and his customers' hands with sanitizer. Indonesia has been heavily impacted by the coronavirus, with at least 240 deaths and nearly 3,000 infections. Health workers in the country have paid a high price, with 24 doctors dying from the disease and 130 medical workers in Jakarta being infected. In response, Jakarta has implemented measures such as closing businesses and schools and plans to enforce large-scale social restrictions with the help of security personnel. Although Maulanasyah's salon is located outside of Jakarta, his income has significantly decreased from 500,000 rupiah ($31) per day to 100,000 rupiah ($6.20) due to the impact of the virus. Despite the cumbersome outfit he wears, customers like Abdul Rahman Fattah feel safer getting their hair cut at Maulanasyah's salon. However, Fattah acknowledges that the protective gear may affect the quality of the haircut. To further protect himself and his family, Maulanasyah only allows four people in the salon at a time and encourages everyone to maintain a safe distance.

27,27,10851,"New test can detect autism in children, scientists say","The article titled ""New test can detect autism in children, scientists say"" discusses a study that claims to have developed blood and urine tests that can detect autism in children. The study found a link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and damage to proteins in blood plasma. The most reliable test developed by the study examined protein in blood plasma and found that children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker 'dityrosine' (DT) and certain sugar-modified components called 'advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)'. However, the article does not provide actual data on the reliability of these tests. The study used a computer to analyze various biomarkers and found that the best diagnostic association was in children with ASD who had higher levels of DT and AGEs. The sensitivity of the model was 92 percent, meaning that 8 percent of children with ASD were missed by the model, and the specificity was 84 percent, meaning that 16 percent of children diagnosed with ASD did not actually have the condition. The article raises concerns about the potential harms of routine screening for autism using these tests. False positive results could lead parents to believe their child has ASD when they do not, while false negative results could offer false assurance that there is no ASD present. The article also highlights the limitations of the study, including the fact that it can only show an association between biomarkers and children already diagnosed with ASD, and it cannot prove that these biomarkers cause autism or predict its development. The article points out that there is no existing diagnostic test for autism and that diagnosis is based solely on behavioral observations and assessments. It also questions the novelty of the blood and urine tests, as the study does not prove that they can predict or diagnose autism. The article does not include independent sources or mention conflicts of interest. It also does not provide information on the costs of the blood and urine tests or the availability of these tests. The article concludes by noting that quotes and sentences from a news release were used without apparent original reporting.",false,"A small European study found increased biomarkers in the blood of 38 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when compared to 31 healthy children in the control group. This story jumps the gun by implying the results suggest these biomarkers cannot only “detect autism in children” but also “could lead to earlier diagnosis.” This speculative language appears to come directly from the lead author of the study who’s also quoted as saying “we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.” What would have helped this story considerably would be interviewing sources not affiliated with the study to clarify the limitations of these biomarkers, explain how ASD is currently diagnosed, and provide some much-needed context about the novelty, availability, and clinical relevance of the biomarkers studied. Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of problems with social communication and interaction, as well as behavioral issues that can be repetitive, compulsive, and/or disruptive in many social settings. The condition cannot be predicted or cured, so any news coverage about a potential screening method needs to be extremely cautious and pay special attention to the limitations of the study at hand, as well as include critique from independent sources. According to 2016 statistics published by the CDC, around 1.1 million American children under the age of 21 have been diagnosed with autism, with a prevalence of roughly 1 in 68 kids.","The article titled ""New test can detect autism in children, scientists say"" discusses a study that claims to have developed blood and urine tests that can detect autism in children.

However, the article does not provide actual data on the reliability of these tests.

The study used a computer to analyze various biomarkers and found that the best diagnostic association was in children with ASD who had higher levels of DT and AGEs. The sensitivity of the model was 92 percent, meaning that 8 percent of children with ASD were missed by the model, and the specificity was 84 percent, meaning that 16 percent of children diagnosed with ASD did not actually have the condition.

The article raises concerns about the potential harms of routine screening for autism using these tests. False positive results could lead parents to believe their child has ASD when they do not, while false negative results could offer false assurance that there is no ASD present. The article also highlights the limitations of the study, including the fact that it can only show an association between biomarkers and children already diagnosed with ASD, and it cannot prove that these biomarkers cause autism or predict its development.

The article points out that there is no existing diagnostic test for autism and that diagnosis is based solely on behavioral observations and assessments. It also questions the novelty of the blood and urine tests, as the study does not prove that they can predict or diagnose autism.

The article does not include independent sources or mention conflicts of interest. It also does not provide information on the costs of the blood and urine tests or the availability of these tests. The article concludes by noting that quotes and sentences from a news release were used without apparent original reporting.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Claim: Results mixed on Merck’s new painkiller
The claim veracity: mixture

### Response:
","
The results of Merck's new painkiller are mixed. On the one hand, the drug has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and inflammation, and it has a lower risk of addiction than other opioids. On the other hand, the drug has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and it is not clear how effective it is in treating chronic pain. Additionally, the drug is expensive, and it is not clear if it is cost-effective compared to other treatments. Overall, the results of Merck's new painkiller are mixed, and more research is needed to determine its long-term safety and effectiveness.

29,29,25853,“Florida is doing over five times better” than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people.,"The claim that Florida is doing over five times better than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people is misleading. While it is true that Florida's death rate is lower than that of New Jersey and New York, there are important factors to consider. According to an epidemiologist, the metric of COVID-19 deaths per million people is time-sensitive and difficult to interpret without proper context. The true denominator, which is the number of people infected, is unknown, and it is impossible to predict the future course of the outbreak. The Facebook post that made the claim cited data from Worldometer, which showed that Florida's death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey's and New York's. Other databases, including one from Johns Hopkins University, also confirmed this finding. However, this measure is limited because it only focuses on a state that became a hotspot after New York and New Jersey. News reports before the Facebook post highlighted Florida's record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases. The state had the highest single-day total of new cases and the highest weekly death total during the outbreak. A federal report also classified Florida as one of the 21 states in the ""red zone"" due to serious outbreaks. To provide a larger perspective, among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people. This statistic, according to Johns Hopkins University, places the US behind the United Kingdom, Peru, and Chile. Timing is a crucial factor in understanding the misleading nature of the claim. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, while Florida experienced its surge later. Experts argue that it is necessary to wait until the outbreak is over to accurately assess how well states have handled the situation. As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared to 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York. However, death counts and rates are lagging indicators and cannot predict the future course of the outbreak.

Many people in Haiti lost limbs in the earthquake, and the players have received treatment, athletic training, and prosthetic limbs through a program funded by Miami's Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus. Over 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs so far, with hundreds more set to begin treatment in the coming weeks and months. Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, there is a sense of pessimism and despair in Haiti. The country was already impoverished before the earthquake, with 70% of the population living on less than $2 a day. The rebuilding efforts have been slow, and major streets in the capital city of Port-au-Prince are still covered in debris. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who heads a reconstruction commission, has faced criticism for the lack of tangible results. The anniversary of the earthquake promises little in the way of celebration, with many people expressing disappointment in the lack of progress. The article also mentions the reopening of Port-au-Prince's restored Iron Market as part of the commemoration events. The market, a cultural and architectural landmark, was badly damaged in the earthquake and has been restored with funding from Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel. However, for many Haitians living in crowded camps, such projects hold little interest.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

The South West News Service acknowledged issues with the story and pulled it from circulation. They received new information that cast doubt on the widespread nature of the claims made by the charity. In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the claim that black cats in Vietnam are being killed and consumed as a COVID-19 cure."

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

35,35,21340,"Earl Blumenauer Says ""Every year air pollution protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely.","The article discusses a claim made by Rep. Earl Blumenauer that delaying air pollution protections would result in 34,000 premature deaths each year. The claim was made during a debate in Congress regarding legislation that would delay or scrap rules to reduce harmful air emissions. The bill, passed by Republicans in the House, is unlikely to pass the Senate and would be vetoed by President Obama if it did. The bill includes a provision to set up a committee to evaluate the impact of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on jobs, electricity, gasoline prices, and competitiveness. Republicans argue that action is needed to slow down excessive regulations imposed by unelected bureaucrats, while Democrats claim the bill is a gift to businesses that would result in dirtier air and more deaths. Blumenauer's claim specifically refers to the delay of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which aims to limit sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 27 states. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the rule would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 6.4 million tons per year and nitrogen oxide emissions by 1.4 million tons per year. Blumenauer's claim is supported by studies conducted by the EPA, including a 414-page analysis released in June. The report, titled ""Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States,"" states that the benefits of the rule would result in 13,000 to 34,000 fewer premature deaths related to particulate matter and ozone pollution. While Blumenauer's claim is supported by the EPA's findings, he cherry-picked the highest death number of 34,000 instead of using the range of 13,000 to 34,000. This omission does not change the conclusion that air pollution is harmful to public health, but it could exaggerate the problem.

36,36,34656,A baby died at an unnamed medical facility because its parents refused to allow a black nurse to care for the child.,"The article discusses a claim made by a former Twitter user, @FierceFemtivist, about a baby who died at an unnamed medical facility because its parents refused to allow a black nurse to care for the child. The tweets made by @FierceFemtivist were circulated on social media platforms like Facebook and Tumblr. However, the article highlights that @FierceFemtivist did not provide specific details about the incident, such as the date, facility name, medical condition, or gender of the baby. The article questions the credibility of the claim, as @FierceFemtivist presented the incident as a narrative of racism, with the parents being portrayed as racist individuals who allowed their child to die solely because of the nurse's race. The article points out that there is no information about any response from the hospital or other medical staff during the critical event. It suggests that the narrative presented in the tweets implies that the facility passively allowed the baby to die, despite hospitals and Child Protective Services having protocols for emergency interventions. @FierceFemtivist also described the parents as unmoved by grief and only concerned about whether a black staff member would handle the infant's corpse. The article raises questions about the incident, such as whether it occurred on the date the tweets were posted or earlier, the location of the facility, why no other nurses or doctors intervened, and whether the police were involved in investigating the baby's death. Additionally, the article questions the specific details of the claim, such as the type of life-saving care that only the nurse in question could provide and whether any adults were considered liable for the baby's death. The article concludes by highlighting that @FierceFemtivist deleted her account, along with the controversial tweets, leaving readers with unanswered questions.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

There are two major kinds of AMD, ""wet"" or neovascular and ""dry."" Although the ""wet"" form is much less common than ""dry"", it is much more likely to lead to blindness, which can occur very suddenly. Until recently, wet AMD was treated with lasers or phototherapy, however in June, 2006 the FDA approved the drug Lucentis for the condition. This story reports on advancements in treatment of AMD but then goes on to talk about developments in treating cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.

39,39,35539,"By spring 2020, the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period where its solar activity decreased to the point that famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather threatened life on Earth.","The article investigates the claim that the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period in spring 2020, resulting in decreased solar activity that could lead to famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather on Earth. The article explains that the sun's activity, including the number of sunspots and intensity of solar flares, fluctuates on an 11-year cycle known as the solar cycle. The cycle consists of a solar maximum phase, when sunspots increase, and a solar minimum phase, when sunspots decrease. As of May 2020, the sun was in a solar minimum phase, which confirmed one aspect of the claim. During a solar minimum, the sun's activity changes form but does not become dull. There is a greater likelihood of long-lived coronal holes, which can cause space weather effects when they hit Earth's magnetic field. These effects include temporary disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere, auroras, and disruptions to communications and navigation systems. Additionally, during a solar minimum, the Earth's upper atmosphere cools, causing a decrease in drag and allowing space junk to accumulate. However, the article emphasizes that the 2019-2020 solar minimum was not forecasted to have catastrophic effects. Scientists projected that the 25th sun cycle would likely be weak but similar to the previous cycle in terms of the number of sunspots. The article cites a solar scientist who states that the current solar minimum is not unprecedented and that previous deep solar minima did not cause famines, earthquakes, or other catastrophes. The scientist also notes that there is no evidence that the sun is ""stuck"" in a solar minimum, as sunspots have always reappeared after previous minima. The concerns about the sun's activity originated from a report by the British tabloid newspaper, The Sun, which referred to the normal occurrence of a solar minimum as a ""lockdown"" without providing specific attribution. In conclusion, while the sun was indeed in a solar minimum phase in spring 2020, there was no evidence to support the claim that this would lead to famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather on Earth. The solar minimum is a regular part of the sun's 11-year cycle, and previous deep solar minima did not result in catastrophic effects.",false,"What's true: Solar activity, which is often defined by the amount of sunspots on the star's surface, pendulates on a roughly 11-year cycle.

What's false: While the sun had entered a so-called ""lockdown"" period — when the number of sunspots on the star's surface decreased to few or none, technically called a ""solar minimum"" — by spring 2020, it was a normal occurrence for the star and was not projected by scientists to threaten life on Earth with famine, earthquakes, or freezing weather.","The article investigates the claim that the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period in spring 2020, resulting in decreased solar activity that could lead to famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather on Earth.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: The article investigates the claim that the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period in spring 2020, resulting in decreased solar activity that could lead to famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather on Earth. The article explains that the sun's activity, including the number of sunspots and intensity of solar flares, fluctuates on an 11-year cycle known as the solar cycle. The cycle consists of a solar maximum phase, when sunspots increase, and a solar minimum phase, when sunspots decrease. As of May 2020, the sun was in a solar minimum phase, which confirmed one aspect of the claim. During a solar minimum, the sun's activity changes form but does not become dull. There is a greater likelihood of long-lived coronal holes, which can cause space weather effects when they hit Earth's magnetic field. These effects include temporary disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere, auroras, and disruptions to communications and navigation systems. Additionally, during a solar minimum, the Earth's upper atmosphere cools, causing a decrease in drag and allowing space junk to accumulate. However, the article emphasizes that the 2019-2020 solar minimum was not forecasted to have catastrophic effects. Scientists projected that the 25th sun cycle would likely be weak but similar to the previous cycle in terms of the number of sunspots. The article cites a solar scientist who states that the current solar minimum is not unprecedented and that previous deep solar minima did not cause famines, earthquakes, or other catastrophes. The scientist also notes that there is no evidence that the sun is ""stuck"" in a solar minimum, as sunspots have always reappeared after previous minima.

40,40,11967,"Insurance companies ""have made a fortune with Obamacare.","President Donald Trump claimed that insurance companies ""have made a fortune with Obamacare."" However, an analysis of the insurance industry's profits shows that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did not contribute significantly to their earnings. While the top five for-profit insurance companies reported $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017, this cannot be directly attributed to Obamacare. The ACA exchanges, where people buy private insurance, make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. In fact, returns from the exchanges have been poor, leading three out of five of the companies mentioned to withdraw from the exchanges due to significant losses. The overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 helped balance out these losses for insurers who stayed in the exchanges. However, the ACA did have both positive and negative effects on insurance company profits. On the negative side, the ACA imposed limits on the spread between premiums collected and medical services paid out, which likely had a modest downward effect on profits. Additionally, a tax on insurance companies helped finance Obamacare. On the positive side, the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA led to underwriting gains for insurers. However, when considering the losses tied to the exchanges, regulations, and taxes on one hand, and the profits on Medicaid on the other, it is a wash for the insurance industry. The bulk of the insurance business lies in employer-based coverage, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the under-65 insurance market.

Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients: The article could not find definitive information to support or refute this claim. 6. Butter has more nutritional benefits than margarine: The article acknowledges that butter has more vitamin content and is a more natural product than margarine. However, butter is high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased heart attack risk. Margarine can contain trans fats, but there are options available with reduced or eliminated trans fats. 7.

### Response:

The article provides a list of comparative facts about margarine and butter, addressing various claims made about margarine and providing information to support or refute these claims. The article confirms that margarine was indeed created as a substitute for butter, but not specifically to fatten turkeys. It states that a tablespoon of both butter and margarine contains 100 calories, and that eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% due to the presence of trans fat in some margarines. The article also mentions that butter is slightly higher in saturated fats, and that eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients. It acknowledges that butter has more vitamin content and is a more natural product than margarine, but also notes that butter is high in saturated fat, which is associated with increased heart attack risk. The article confirms that margarine can contain trans fats, but there are options available with reduced or eliminated trans fats. It also states that butter tastes better than margarine, but that this is a matter of personal taste. The article confirms that margarine was introduced in France in 1869 as an inexpensive alternative to butter, and that margarine is high in trans fatty acids. It also confirms that margarine increases total cholesterol and LDL (bad cholesterol) and lowers HDL (good cholesterol), and that margarine increases the risk of cancers up to fivefold. The article also mentions that a mother's consumption of trans fats can affect","The article provides a list of comparative facts about margarine and butter, addressing various claims made about margarine and providing information to support or refute these claims.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs.

Signer's claim is supported by a report published by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which states that studies have shown a connection between firearm ownership and suicide rates. The report cites a series of studies conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, which compared data on suicides and gun ownership in each state. The researchers found that states with higher rates of household gun ownership also had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides. The data used in these studies is from 2000 to 2002, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped researching gun issues and removed questions about gun ownership from their surveys after 2004. The CDC surveys showed that states with higher rates of household gun ownership, such as Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska, also had higher suicide rates. Conversely, states with lower rates of gun ownership, such as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, had lower suicide rates. While the data used in these studies is over a decade old, the ranking of states based on suicide rates has remained relatively consistent. The CDC's latest available statistics from 2013 show that Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana still have the highest suicide rates. However, there is a lack of updated, exhaustive surveys on household gun ownership in each state. Researchers and analysts still cite the CDC state figures as they believe that gun ownership levels across states do not change significantly over time. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, stated that the presence of guns is connected to high suicide rates, as many suicides are impulsive and people use whatever is readily available.

Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides.

Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, recently visited Virginia's Capitol to advocate for tougher gun laws. They launched a coalition that aims to find ""common-sense solutions"" to gun violence in the state, with a focus on closing loopholes in Virginia's background check law for prospective gun buyers. Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, joined the meeting and highlighted the special risks that the availability of guns poses to those with mental disorders. She stated that states with the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates. Signer's claim is supported by a report published by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which states that studies have shown a connection between firearm ownership and suicide rates. The report cites a series of studies conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, which compared data on suicides and gun ownership in each state. The researchers found that states with higher rates of household gun ownership also had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides. The data used in these studies is from 2000 to 2002, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped researching gun issues and removed questions about gun ownership from their surveys after 2004. The CDC surveys showed that states with higher rates of household gun ownership, such as Wyoming, Montana, and Alaska, also had higher suicide rates. Conversely, states with lower rates of gun ownership, such as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, had lower suicide rates. While the data used in these studies is over a decade old, the ranking of states based on suicide rates has remained relatively consistent. The CDC's latest available statistics from 2013 show that Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana still have the highest suicide rates. However, there is a lack of updated, exhaustive surveys on household gun ownership in each state. Researchers and analysts still cite the CDC state figures as they believe that gun ownership levels across states do not change significantly over time. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, stated that the presence of guns is connected to high suicide rates, as many suicides are impulsive and people use whatever is readily available. The case fatality rate for guns is much higher than for other common forms of suicide attempts. In conclusion, Signer's claim that states with the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates is supported by data from the CDC and studies conducted by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. While the data used in these studies is outdated, the ranking of states based on suicide rates has remained consistent. However, there is a lack of updated data on household gun ownership in each state.

Context: The article discusses the potential benefits of a new drug called Celebrex, which is being studied for its ability to prevent colon cancer. The study found that Celebrex reduced the number of polyps in the colon by 30% compared to a placebo. However, the study also found that Celebrex increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20%. The article notes that the study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, and that the study's authors had financial ties to the company. The article also mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and that it is not clear if the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The article concludes that more research is needed to determine if Celebrex is safe and effective for preventing colon cancer.

This is a standard practice followed by other Republican-held states like Iowa, Georgia, Nebraska, and West Virginia. Receiving an application does not automatically mean a ballot will be issued; the application needs to be filled out and returned, and the recipient's signature must match their existing voter records to be issued a ballot. The move to expand opportunities for casting an absentee ballot in Michigan was a response to an increase in voter turnout via mail during local elections held on May 5, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. By mailing applications, the Michigan secretary of state's office aimed to ensure that residents did not have to choose between their health and their right to vote. President Trump's threat to ""hold up funding"" against Michigan is seen as a swipe at Democratic officials in the state, including Jocelyn Benson and Governor Gretchen Whitmer. This threat comes after Trump used his Twitter account to support armed far-right demonstrators demanding the easing of stay-at-home measures implemented by Governor Whitmer to limit the spread of COVID-19. However, a majority of Americans have expressed concern that reopening businesses too soon would lead to an increase in infections. This Twitter smear by President Trump is also seen as another instance of him pushing the false claim of ""voter fraud.""

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

49,49,8965,NUS researchers use AI to successfully treat metastatic cancer patient,"The article discusses the use of an AI platform called CURATE.AI to treat a metastatic cancer patient. However, the article raises several concerns and limitations regarding the platform and the study. Firstly, it is unclear whether CURATE.AI is a proprietary platform and what the cost would be for healthcare providers to access and use it. The level of training required for healthcare providers to use the platform in a clinical setting is also unknown. Given that the platform aims to create personalized treatments for each patient, the cost could be significant. The article highlights that the study only involved one patient, making it impossible to quantify the benefits of the treatment. While the patient's disease progression was halted, no information is provided about the tumor's biology, and no conclusions can be drawn without a comparator group. The article also raises concerns about the potential mistakes that AI programs can make in the context of cancer treatment. It questions whether the ongoing clinical trials using CURATE.AI-guided therapies will identify any risks or potential harms and how medication dosages will be adjusted to reduce side effects. Furthermore, the article criticizes the release for not providing enough context on the prevalence of prostate cancer and for not disclosing the funding sources for the study or the creation of CURATE.AI. It also mentions that CURATE.AI is not the only AI tool being considered for cancer treatment and that the release does not explain how it differs from existing work in the field. The language used in the release is also deemed unsatisfactory, with claims that the study demonstrates CURATE.AI's ability to optimize multi-drug regimens and that it is applicable to all diseases and patients. However, these claims are not supported by the study's limitations and the lack of evidence provided. Overall, the article highlights the limitations and concerns surrounding the use of CURATE.AI in cancer treatment.

The release argues that this is a “gamechanger” and a “big step forward” that “is applicable to all diseases and all patients” — which are bold claims to make based on the treatment of only one patient. Unjustifiable language throughout and a lack of attention to key details like harms, cost and an explanation of the severe limitations of the research make this a weak and misleading release. There has been a lot of research focused on the use of AI to help diagnose cancers and develop treatment protocols — and it continues to be an area of great interest. However, it is difficult — if not impossible — to draw far-reaching conclusions from a single case. What costs, benefits and risks are associated with AI-directed treatment for cancers? A study like the one highlighted in this release simply cannot tell us. The release claims the researchers were able to improve treatment efficacy by adjusting treatment dose and presumably still minimizing adverse events. Again — impossible to prove based on a single patient. It is an interesting case study, and we look forward to learning the results of future research, but it is misleading (if not dishonest) to make sweeping claims based on the treatment of a single patient.","The article discusses the use of an AI platform called CURATE.AI to treat a metastatic cancer patient.

50,50,8744,Both real and virtual colonoscopies work: report.,"A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that both real and virtual colonoscopies are equally effective in detecting precancerous polyps. The study, conducted by Dr. Daniel Johnson and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, involved performing both types of colonoscopies on 2,500 volunteers. The virtual colonoscopy, also known as CT colonography or CTC, uses an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner to detect polyps, while the real colonoscopy is done by gastroenterologists using a flexible lit tube passed through the bowel. The study found that the virtual colonoscopy detected 90% of precancerous polyps that were 10 millimeters or larger. While both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, the virtual colonoscopy does not require sedation, allowing patients to quickly resume their normal activities. Additionally, the cost of a virtual colonoscopy is significantly lower than a real colonoscopy, and there is less risk of puncturing the bowel. However, both types of colonoscopies require patients to drink strong laxatives, which is a major complaint among patients. If lesions are spotted during a virtual colonoscopy, a real colonoscopy is required to remove them. Virtual colonoscopies can also be uncomfortable as they require briefly inflating the bowel with carbon dioxide. Colorectal cancer kills 52,000 people in the United States each year, and most Americans are advised to begin regular colonoscopies at age 50. However, only about half of the 70 million Americans at risk for colon cancer are currently getting screened. The availability of a noninvasive method like the virtual colonoscopy may encourage more people to get tested. Gastroenterologists are concerned that the popularity of virtual colonoscopies may take away business from them. However, Dr. Brooks Cash of the American Gastroenterology Association believes that the availability of a noninvasive method has actually increased the volume of colonoscopies performed. This means that more people may require follow-up colonoscopies to remove any polyps that could potentially develop into tumors.

However, both types of colonoscopies require patients to drink strong laxatives, which is a major complaint among patients. If lesions are spotted during a virtual colonoscopy, a real colonoscopy is required to remove them. Virtual colonoscopies can also be uncomfortable as they require briefly inflating the bowel with carbon dioxide. Colorectal cancer kills 52,000 people in the United States each year, and most Americans are advised to begin regular colonoscopies at age 50. However, only about half of the 70 million Americans at risk"

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

53,53,10372,Drug May Delay Pancreatic Cancer Return,"A new study has found that a drug called capecitabine may help delay the return of pancreatic cancer after surgery. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved 730 patients who had undergone surgery to remove pancreatic cancer. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine, while the other half received a placebo. The researchers found that the drug reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 40% compared to the placebo group. The median time to cancer recurrence was 23 months in the capecitabine group, compared to 19 months in the placebo group. The study also found that the drug did not have any significant impact on overall survival. However, the researchers noted that the study was not designed to assess overall survival and that further research is needed to determine if the drug can improve survival rates. The side effects of capecitabine were described as relatively mild, including fatigue and hair thinning. These side effects are common with chemotherapy drugs and are considered manageable. The drug is already used to treat inoperable pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer, so its safety profile is well-established. Dr. Smith, a researcher not involved in the study, commented on the findings, stating that the study provides important evidence for the use of capecitabine in preventing cancer recurrence after surgery.

The article mentions that the study is part of a larger body","The article provides a clear and concise summary of a recent study that found that a drug called capecitabine may help delay the return of pancreatic cancer after surgery. The study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved 730 patients who had undergone surgery to remove pancreatic cancer. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine, while the other half received a placebo. The researchers found that the drug reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 40% compared to the placebo group. The median time to cancer recurrence was 23 months in the capecitabine group, compared to 19 months in the placebo group. The study also found that the drug did not have any significant impact on overall survival. However, the researchers noted that the study was not designed to assess overall survival and that further research is needed to determine if the drug can improve survival rates. The side effects of capecitabine were described as relatively mild, including fatigue and hair thinning. These side effects are common with chemotherapy drugs and are considered manageable. The drug is already used to treat inoperable pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer, so its safety profile is well-established.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

The study used data from a government survey of three groups of children aged 2 through 8 between 1988 and 2006. The chronic health conditions included obesity, asthma, and learning problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The researchers emphasized the importance of access to healthcare for children in order to diagnose and treat these conditions. They stated that primary care is especially crucial as many of these conditions are picked up and treated there. The study also found that while 16.6% of children had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study period, 20.8% reported having a chronic condition at the end. However, only 7.4% of children had a chronic condition both at the beginning and at the end of the study period, and 9.3% of children reported having a chronic condition at the beginning that was not present at the end. The researchers described this as a hopeful finding, as it suggests that many chronic conditions in children can resolve over time. They called for further research to understand why some conditions go away while others do not, and to identify factors that contribute to improvements in children's health. Dr. Geetha Raghuveer, who was not involved in the study, expressed concern about the large percentage of children with chronic health problems and called for prevention strategies at the family, school, community, and policy levels to address these issues.

The study also found that while 16.6% of children had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study period, 20.8% reported having a chronic condition at the end. However, only 7.4% of children had a chronic condition both at the beginning and at the end of the study period, and 9.3% of children reported having a chronic condition at the beginning that was not present at the end. The researchers described this as a hopeful finding, as it suggests that many chronic conditions in children can resolve over time. They called for further research to understand why some conditions go away while others do not, and to identify factors that contribute to improvements in children's health. Dr. Geetha Raghuveer, who was not involved in the study, expressed concern about the large percentage of children with chronic health problems and called for prevention strategies at the family, school, community, and policy levels to address these issues. Overall, the study highlights the rising prevalence of chronic health conditions among children in the U.S. and the importance of access to healthcare for early diagnosis and treatment.

64,64,22383,There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer.,"The claim made by Ann Coulter that there is a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that radiation in excess of government-approved exposure levels may be beneficial is not widely accepted by the scientific community. While there are some scientists who believe in the concept of hormesis, which suggests that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects, this is considered an outside-the-mainstream opinion. Eric Hall, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, states that there is not a shred of evidence that radiation is good for you, and Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico, calls hormesis a controversial concept. Mettler does mention early studies that seemed to suggest a hormetic effect, but he cautions against reading too much into these studies due to various factors that can influence the results. Owen Hoffman, a radiation-risk expert, explains that while low levels of radiation might eliminate some cancers, they can also initiate and promote new cancers. Dr. Charles Land of the National Cancer Institute also concludes that the possibility of a protective or beneficial effect of radiation exposure cannot be completely ruled out, but the evidence does not support the presence of such effects in human populations. Coulter cites the work of Bernard L. Cohen, a physics professor, who found a correlation between radon exposure and lung cancer rates in certain counties. However, Cohen clarifies that his study was designed to test the assumption that the danger of radiation is simply proportional to the radiation dose, and his conclusion was that this assumption is false. While there is a small but growing body of research supporting the idea of hormesis, the mainstream scientific community does not embrace this theory. They argue that the limitations of these studies and the lack of scientific evidence make it difficult to accept the idea that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects and reduce the risk of cancer.",false,"Ann Coulter says exposure to low levels of radiation is good for you, reduces cancer risk","The claim made by Ann Coulter that there is a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that radiation in excess of government-approved exposure levels may be beneficial is not widely accepted by the scientific community.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

### Input:
Context: President Donald Trump and his administration have declared a national emergency and unveiled a new testing strategy to screen hundreds of thousands of Americans for the coronavirus. The strategy involves setting up drive-thru testing centers at major retail chains, similar to the approach used in countries like South Korea and Germany. The goal is to provide safe, quick, and convenient testing for those who need it. However, the testing is not intended for everyone, particularly those without symptoms. The move comes after criticism of the initial testing effort, with one of the government's top health officials calling it a ""failing."" The US is currently able to test 15,000 to 20,000 patients per day, but the number is expected to increase soon. A new website facilitated by Google will guide users through a series of questions to determine if they should be screened. If testing is recommended, users will be directed to a local testing location, which could include parking lots at major retail chains like Walmart, Target, and Walgreen's. Test results will be available for users to view on the website. Verily, a healthcare company under Google, is working to help triage people for screening and will first launch the effort in the San Francisco Bay area. The government's testing effort has faced challenges due to a limited number of labs running COVID-19 tests and confusion among healthcare workers about who can be tested. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people to seek testing if they have symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus and if they have traveled to an outbreak area or been in close contact with an infected person. Ultimately, it is up to doctors to decide who should be tested. The US testing effort has been delayed by flaws in the initial testing kits distributed by the federal government and bureaucratic hurdles. Public health labs and large commercial labs like LabCorp and Quest are now running the tests, and Medicare and private insurers have announced they will cover the costs. Swiss medical company Roche has received emergency approval from the FDA to run coronavirus tests on its automated system, which is expected to increase testing capacity. In conclusion, President Trump and his administration are implementing a new testing strategy to expand coronavirus testing in the US. Drive-thru testing centers will be set up at major retail chains, and a website facilitated by Google will guide users through the screening process. The testing effort has faced challenges, but steps are being taken to increase capacity and streamline the process.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

SIU's decision to offer programs in marijuana and hemp research aligns with the growing trend of colleges and universities across the country providing courses related to cannabis. The university aims to meet the demand for scientific knowledge in this field and position itself to support the emerging industry.
Claim: Southern Illinois University starts marijuana, hemp research.

Southern Illinois University (SIU) has announced the creation of programs at its Carbondale campus to study medical marijuana and industrial hemp. The programs aim to provide students and farmers with the opportunity to earn a certificate in these subjects. The university has been planning for these programs for several years, taking into account requests and input from stakeholders and students who are interested in preparing for work in these areas. SIU's interdisciplinary program in cannabis science will combine agriculture and plant biology with courses in chemistry, business, and engineering. The program aims to support the emerging industry of hemp and medicinal cannabis, which have shown benefits in various areas such as health, quality of life, and the production of natural fibers. The university has already obtained approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to grow hemp. In the spring, SIU plans to begin planting hemp on a 5-acre parcel of land, which will be divided into individual test plots to study specific research questions related to optimal growing conditions and environmental impact.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

To provide empirical evidence, a biology professor and his students conducted experiments to test the theory. They found that soaked white rice expanded by 33% in volume, while bird seed increased by 40%.

But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: A psychiatric center in a town near the border with France is using therapy dogs to help patients with intellectual disabilities and mental health conditions. The dogs, named Atila and Argi, live on the grounds and are cared for by the patients themselves. The patients are responsible for the dogs 24 hours a day, which helps promote good habits like self-control and personal hygiene. Patients groom and feed the dogs, as well as take them for daily walks to the nearby village. The dogs serve as icebreakers, facilitating conversation with the locals and helping patients develop social skills. The therapy dogs also provide emotional support to patients who struggle to connect with others. The dogs tailor their behavior according to the needs of each patient, playing with those who are more active and sitting still with those who find moving challenging. Patients referred to their feelings for the dogs using words like ""calmness,"" ""companionship,"" and ""affection."" The dogs also work with patients who are unable to feed or walk them, sitting with severe dementia patients to combat isolation and depression by stimulating their senses of touch. The presence of the therapy dogs has become an integral part of the center, with the head nurse stating that ""the dogs are now part of the center."" The dogs provide a calming effect and serve as an emotional outlet for the patients. The patients benefit from the companionship and affection of the dogs, helping them develop a sense of autonomy and improve their social skills. The therapy dogs also contribute to the overall well-being of the patients by promoting good habits and combating isolation and depression. Overall, the use of therapy dogs at the psychiatric center has proven to be beneficial for patients with intellectual disabilities and mental health conditions. The dogs provide emotional support, help patients develop social skills, and promote good habits. The patients have expressed feelings of calmness, companionship, and affection towards the dogs. The presence of the therapy dogs has become an integral part of the center, with the patients taking care of them 24 hours a day.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

77,77,27406,A Fresno man turned up at a local emergency room carrying a 5-foot-long tapeworm he pulled out of his own intestine.,"In January 2018, a man in Fresno, California walked into a local emergency room carrying a 5-foot-long tapeworm that he claimed to have pulled out of his own body. The patient, a frequent sushi eater, had experienced symptoms such as cramping and bloody diarrhea before extracting the parasite. He wrapped the tapeworm around a toilet paper tube and presented it to doctors at Fresno's Community Regional Medical Center, requesting immediate treatment for ""worms."" Dr. Kenny Banh, the attending physician, confirmed the story and described the tapeworm as being five-and-a-half feet long with a flat, skinny body, tan in color, and narrow dark brown lines down its back. Tapeworms are a type of parasitic flatworm that are typically contracted by eating contaminated raw meat or fish. They reside in the digestive tracts of infected humans or animals, using the suckers on their heads to hold themselves in place. Tapeworms can grow to more than 30 feet in length and may or may not cause noticeable symptoms. Treatment for tapeworms in humans is usually a single dose of an oral antihelminthic, a drug that kills the worms. The patient's main concern was figuring out how he contracted the tapeworm, as he hadn't traveled or consumed raw meat. He realized that sushi was the likely source, as he ate it daily and his favorite dish was salmon sashimi. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a research letter in January 2017 warning about the Japanese broad tapeworm, which has been detected in wild salmon caught along the U.S. and Asian Pacific coasts. The CDC stated that consuming raw fish poses potential dangers for tapeworm infection, but freezing the fish kills parasites. Therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all fish to be frozen before it can be served raw in the United States. Dr. Banh found the tapeworm fascinating and not disgusting, as he had seen and treated intestinal worms before. He described it as ""geeky scientifically interesting"" and ""funny"" that it was wrapped around a toilet paper roll.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

The article highlights that the release refers to psilocybin as being ""inexpensive"" as a potential clinical treatment option, but does not provide any basis for this claim or compare it to other treatments. It also notes that the release does not quantify the extent of the benefits of psilocybin treatment, using vague terms like ""significantly lessens mental anguish"" and ""relief from distress."" The article argues that it is important for research institutions to provide more detailed information about the benefits and potential side effects of treatments. The release does a good job of describing the study design and the number of participants, but it does not discuss the use of counseling as a stand-alone treatment option for anxiety or depression, nor does it compare psilocybin treatment with other pharmaceutical options. The article suggests that the release would have been stronger if it had provided a comparison of the pros and cons of different treatment methods. The release acknowledges that psilocybin is a banned substance and that larger clinical trials would be needed for it to be used as a safe and effective medication.

The release notes that 80 percent of participants showed improvement based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression for several months following the treatment. The study is one of two on the subject that were published recently in the Journal of Psychopharmacology (our review of the release for the other study can be found here and a review of a related news article can be read here.) The release does better than its counterpart in terms of addressing conflicts of interest and placing the work in context with previous work in the field. However, the release uses only vague language when addressing the key issues of health benefits and adverse side effects. More specifics on the degree of reduced anxiety and depression scores would have been useful. Because this study and its counterpart offer an intriguing finding — that a single dose of something could be so helpful in alleviating depression — we’ve completed three reviews related to these studies: one on a news story from the LA Times, one on a news release from Johns Hopkins, and this review on the release from NYU. And the core issues involved are similar across all three items. Cancer is a widespread health problem that affects many millions of Americans. According to the National Cancer Institute, just under 1.7 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2016 alone. If you consider that each of those people has a family and loved ones who are also affected by the diagnosis, you can begin to appreciate the scope of the problem. According to a report from the National Institutes of Health’s 2002 State-of-the-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain, Depression, and Fatigue, “The clinical ‘rule of thumb’ is that 25 percent of cancer patients are likely depressed enough at some point in the course of disease to warrant evaluation and treatment.” This makes it especially important for research institutions and news outlets to write responsibly about studies like those discussed in this release. You want to give readers enough information to help them make informed decisions. You don’t want to raise false hopes, or sensationalize the work.

81,81,9256,FDA Clears P-Cure Upright Imaging Solution for Proton Therapy Enhancement,"The article discusses the FDA clearance of P-Cure's upright imaging solution for proton therapy enhancement. The release highlights the potential economic advantages of treating patients in a seated position, stating that it reduces capital investment for the proton beam center. However, it is important to note that the cost savings mentioned in the release refer to the center per patient treated, not the cost for patients themselves. The release does not provide any quantified data on the benefits of the device for patients, such as improved treatment outcomes, comfort, or duration. It also fails to mention any potential harms associated with the therapy. The article criticizes the imprecision of the term ""approval"" used in the release, stating that the company received FDA clearance to market the device, not an approval. The clearance indicates that the device is deemed similar to other approved devices, without requiring proof of safety or effectiveness. The FDA's market clearance letter describes the device as a computed tomography X-ray system intended for scanning patients while seated. The release states that the therapy will initially benefit adult and pediatric patients with cancers of the lung, breast, chest, head and neck, and lower torso. However, the article points out that the release implies an abundance of demand for this therapy without providing evidence-based support. It also notes that the release comes from P-Cure, the company producing the therapy, and compares it to existing devices used for proton beam therapy. The release highlights the drawbacks of standard proton therapy, such as radiation to healthy body parts, discomfort, and high costs, but does not provide quantification or meaningful comparison for reporters and patients. The article acknowledges that the therapy is a modification of prone delivery of proton therapy and is not currently widely available. However, it criticizes the use of terms like ""clinical breakthrough"" and ""paradigm shifting"" without evidence to support these claims. The article suggests that if the treatment is successful, it will have more people sitting up instead of lying down, but emphasizes the need for evidence to support the claims made in the release.",mixture,"P-Cure Ltd. device We’re fully prepared to believe that there are ways to more accurately administer proton beam therapy with fewer side effects and lower costs. This release makes just those claims and yet provides nothing to back the claims up. There is no quantification of benefits. No true exploration of risks. No explanation of the quality of the evidence. And no true comparison of alternatives. The release muddies the water on what kind of nod it got from the US’s regulatory agency. The company received FDA “clearance” to market the device but not an “approval.” (See the discussion under the Quality of Evidence criteria.) Proton beam therapy represents an alternative form of radiotherapy compared to conventional x-rays. Interest in this form of therapy has grown based upon its ability to deliver higher doses of radiation to a smaller field. This may improve the benefit and reduce the harm for patients with cancer who need radiotherapy. Although not a focus in this release, the proven outcomes of proton vs. conventional radiotherapy in terms of benefits (increased survival) and harms (less damage to surrounding normal tissue) are less clear than the proponents of proton therapy would like to admit. For many cancers, conventional therapy may be adequate. Here the question is whether the delivery of proton beam therapy to patients who are getting it can be enhanced by delivering the treatment to the patient in a seated compared to a flat position. One can imagine for some patients that may lead to a more comfortable treatment, but it isn’t clear how many would derive a measurable benefit. The release focuses on decreases in the discomfort of treatment and implies that some who may not otherwise tolerate this therapy could now have it. All interesting, but no information is provided to support the release’s claims. Finally, the release focuses on the potential benefits to the proton beam center in terms of its costs — but patients will have other questions about cost such as whether the device is more expensive than what the center is currently using. If so, those costs may be passed on to insurers and thus patients based upon the specifics of their policy. As such, it isn’t clear whether the “clinical breakthrough” or “paradigm shift” will be apparent to the average patient undergoing this form of cancer treatment.","The article discusses the FDA clearance of P-Cure's upright imaging solution for proton therapy enhancement.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: New Hampshire Governor-elect Chris Sununu will have the opportunity to make key appointments in various departments during his two-year term. However, all appointments must be approved by the five-member executive council, which will be controlled by Republicans. Sununu has not yet announced his nominees. One important appointment that Sununu will have to make is for the position of Attorney General. The current Democratic Attorney General, Joe Foster, will have his appointment expire in early 2017. Foster has made political decisions during his tenure, such as choosing not to defend a state law on education funding and attempting to make the courts send mental health records to the national gun background check system. Foster has also played a role in the state's response to the opioid crisis. Sununu's Attorney General could continue these policies or make changes. Sununu will also have the opportunity to make three appointments to the State Board of Education and appoint a new education commissioner. The board is responsible for setting state education standards and approving charter school applications. The board has adopted standards in language arts and math that align with Common Core, which is opposed by many Republicans. Sununu has expressed a desire to end the Common Core standards and focus on ""local control"" in schools, so his appointments are likely to reflect these priorities. Two of New Hampshire's Supreme Court justices will retire soon, giving Sununu the chance to shape the court through his appointments. In the past, Democratic governors have used a bipartisan judicial review commission to suggest nominees, while the last Republican governor appointed his own partisan commission. Sununu has stated that he would use a bipartisan selection commission. The Supreme Court is the state's highest court and has made important decisions on issues such as the death penalty, privacy rights, and school funding. Other departments that Sununu will make appointments for include labor, corrections, liquor, cultural resources, agriculture, insurance, and resources and economic development. Overall, Sununu's appointments will have a significant impact on judicial and education policy in New Hampshire, as well as other areas of governance.

Context: The article discusses the potential benefits of using a new type of drug called a PARP inhibitor to treat ovarian cancer. The drug works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP-ribose polymerase, which is involved in repairing DNA damage. The article mentions that PARP inhibitors have been shown to be effective in treating ovarian cancer in clinical trials, and that they may also be effective in treating other types of cancer. However, the article also notes that PARP inhibitors can cause side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and hair loss. The article also mentions that PARP inhibitors are not yet approved for use in the United States, but that they are being studied in clinical trials.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms.

Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence for murder, hung himself in prison at the age of 27. The article also mentions that Hernandez's lawyer filed a lawsuit against the NFL and the New England Patriots, claiming they failed to protect their players' safety. CTE is a brain disease that can affect areas of the brain involved in regulating behavior and emotions. Symptoms of CTE in former football players include aggression, depression, memory loss, and dementia. However, it is unclear whether CTE-related brain damage directly causes these behaviors, as substance abuse and other illnesses may also be linked to these symptoms. Repeated head blows from contact sports and military combat are the most likely causes of CTE. These blows can cause the brain to ricochet inside the skull, damaging nerve cells. Researchers are also investigating the role of genetics, drugs, and alcohol in making certain individuals more susceptible to CTE. CTE can only be diagnosed after death, and a defining feature is the abnormal deposits of tau protein in the brain. In a study conducted by Dr. McKee, CTE was found in the brains of almost all ex-NFL players studied, as well as in former college and high school players who died by suicide or drug overdoses. The true frequency of CTE in football, other sports, the military, and the general population is not known. It is also unclear how many head hits Hernandez experienced throughout his football career. However, Dr. McKee has found evidence of CTE in an 18-year-old and three high school players, suggesting that the disease can occur at a young age.

The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

Context: The article discusses the findings of Dr. Ann McKee, a Boston University researcher, who discovered evidence of severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the brain of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez. Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence for murder, hung himself in prison at the age of 27. The article also mentions that Hernandez's lawyer filed a lawsuit against the NFL and the New England Patriots, claiming they failed to protect their players' safety. CTE is a brain disease that can affect areas of the brain involved in regulating behavior and emotions. Symptoms of CTE in former football players include aggression, depression, memory loss, and dementia. However, it is unclear whether CTE-related brain damage directly causes these behaviors, as substance abuse and other illnesses may also be linked to these symptoms. Repeated head blows from contact sports and military combat are the most likely causes of CTE. These blows can cause the brain to ricochet inside the skull, damaging nerve cells. Researchers are also investigating the role of genetics, drugs, and alcohol in making certain individuals more susceptible to CTE. CTE can only be diagnosed after death, and a defining feature is the abnormal deposits of tau protein in the brain. In a study conducted by Dr. McKee, CTE was found in the brains of almost all ex-NFL players studied, as well as in former college and high school players who died by suicide or drug overdoses. The true frequency of CTE in football, other sports, the military, and the general population is not known. It is also unclear how many head hits Hernandez experienced throughout his football career. However, Dr. McKee has found evidence of CTE in an 18-year-old and three high school players, suggesting that the disease can occur at a young age. In summary, the article discusses the findings of CTE in Aaron Hernandez's brain and raises questions about whether the disease could explain his behavior. It also provides information about the causes and symptoms of CTE, as well as the ongoing research in this field.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex.

89,89,9866,Gallbladder removed through mouth in new surgical technique,"A new surgical technique called natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been used to remove a gallbladder through the mouth. The procedure was performed by lead investigator Santiago Horgan at the University of California, San Diego. The hope is that NOTES will reduce the risk of infection, pain, and abdominal scars compared to traditional laparoscopic surgery. The study aims to compare the costs between the two techniques, but no specific cost information is provided in the article. The article does not mention any potential harm or risks associated with the procedure or the use of this new technique over proven alternatives. It also does not provide any information about the effectiveness of gallbladder surgery or the cure rate for cancerous tumors in the gallbladder. The article states that NOTES requires a new set of skills for surgeons and may have a learning curve. It also mentions that the surgery still requires small incisions in the abdomen for increased visibility. The article does not provide any information about the length of time required under anesthesia, pre-surgery preparations, or the accuracy of the technique compared to others. The article does not mention the reasons why someone would have their gallbladder removed. The press release states that approximately 750,000 gallbladder removal surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. The article does not provide any independent sources or conflicts of interest. It briefly mentions three studies from the Cochrane Library that cast doubt on the idea that minimal is always better in surgery. Overall, the article lacks specific information about costs, benefits, potential harm, and the quality of evidence for the new surgical technique.",false,"This is what old news hands used to call a ""Hey, Martha!"" story, meaning that when someone reads it they will say, ""Hey, Martha! Can you believe this?"" As such, it makes sense for a news outlet to write about it, but at least some care should be taken to put this experimental procedure into the proper context. Even short items written as blog posts should be well reported, especially from a news organization as large and as influential as the Los Angeles Times. There is this assumption that minimally invasive surgeries are better simply because they require less cutting. In some cases this is true, but stories about minimally invasive techniques need to provide the evidence that they improve patient outcomes and that they are better than alternatives to surgery.This same type of thing happens among consumer electronics reporters. Smaller is always better. Except, who wants to listen to John Adams’ Century Rolls on ear buds that provide the sonic range of a toaster oven?

One such employee, Ashley Brown, a 23-year-old cabin crew member for EasyJet, has signed up to help the National Health Service (NHS) in the fight against the virus. Brown's first aid training, security clearance, and experience working in high-stress environments make him a desirable recruit for the new hospitals. He acknowledges the pay cut he will face in the coming months but is determined to support his airline and keep his job. The NHS has stated that volunteers will receive training and assist doctors and nurses with non-clinical tasks such as changing beds. Brown, who previously worked for an NHS Trust in stop-smoking services, is prepared for the potential risk of being exposed to the virus, as safety is already a daily concern in his cabin crew job. EasyJet has parked all its 344 planes and laid off UK-based cabin crew for two months, with employees receiving 80% of their average pay under a state job-retention scheme. The airline has written to 9,000 staff members, while Virgin Atlantic has reached out to around 4,000 employees, asking them to consider volunteering during this time. The involvement of airline staff in the healthcare sector highlights the collaborative efforts being made to combat the coronavirus pandemic. By utilizing the skills and experience of cabin crew members, the NHS can benefit from additional support in handling the influx of patients.

91,91,888,Singapore seizes ivory from nearly 300 elephants in record haul.,"Singapore authorities have seized a record-breaking amount of ivory, estimated to be worth $12.9 million, from nearly 300 African elephants. The ivory was being transported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Vietnam through Singapore. This seizure is the third major one of pangolin scales in Singapore this year. The pangolin, a highly trafficked mammal, is sought after for its meat, considered a delicacy in Vietnam and China, and its scales, used in traditional Chinese medicine. The Singapore Customs, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and the National Parks Board have stated that the seized pangolin scales and elephant ivory will be destroyed to prevent them from re-entering the market. The seizure was made after a tip-off from China's customs department. While the ivory haul falls just short of the largest ever seizure globally, which occurred in Vietnam in March, it is still a significant amount. There has been an increase in seizures of illegal wildlife products, including rhino horns, in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in recent months. Singapore, in particular, has been implicated in the global ivory trade due to its global connectivity and the presence of a small domestic market where pre-1990s ivory can be legally sold. This consistency of large-scale seizures suggests the involvement of organized crime in the illegal wildlife trade passing through or into Singapore. In addition to the ivory, the authorities also seized 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales, worth approximately $35.7 million. This amount is equivalent to close to 2,000 pangolins. Since April, Singapore has seized a total of 37.5 tonnes of pangolin scales, including one raid that was the largest of its kind worldwide in five years. Singapore is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and claims to be committed to curbing the illegal wildlife trade. The authorities have been working to combat this issue, but the recent seizures highlight the ongoing challenges in preventing the trafficking of endangered species and their products.",true,"Singapore said on Tuesday it had seized 8.8 tonnes of elephant ivory, a record haul by authorities in the city-state, which conservation groups say is a transit point for the illegal wildlife trade.","Singapore authorities have seized a record-breaking amount of ivory, estimated to be worth $12.9 million, from nearly 300 African elephants.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

","The New York City Council has voted to add electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, to the city's Smoke-Free Air Act. If the mayor signs the bill, smoking e-cigarettes, also known as ""vaping,"" would be prohibited in public and private venues such as beaches, parks, restaurants, and office buildings. The bill was sponsored by City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who believes that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine anti-smoking laws. E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in various flavors. When a user puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that does not contain tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law argue that the ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a board member at NJOY, one of America's largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council urging them to reject the bill. Carmona expressed concern that including e-cigarettes in the smoking ban could be a setback in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking. The debate over the risks versus benefits of e-cigarettes is ongoing, but a recent study published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, found that they are as effective as nicotine patches for smokers trying to quit. Three states - Utah, North Dakota, and New Jersey - have already passed legislation banning e-cigarettes wherever smoking is prohibited. "
94,94,9816,Novel Stem Cell Treatment May Hold Promise for Type 1 Diabetes,"The article discusses a novel stem cell treatment that may hold promise for Type 1 diabetes. The treatment involves using stem cells to regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The article highlights a recent study conducted in China where 12 patients with Type 1 diabetes were treated with this stem cell therapy. The study found that the treatment was safe and resulted in a reduction in insulin use for the patients. However, the article raises concerns about the preliminary nature of the research and the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the treatment. It emphasizes that the study was designed to look for safety issues and did not assess long-term health outcomes or rates of complications associated with diabetes. The article cautions against making broad claims about the treatment's safety and effectiveness based on such limited evidence. The article also points out that the study only included patients with Type 1 diabetes, which is a rarer form of the disease. It notes that the treatment's potential benefits for the more common Type 2 diabetes are unknown. The article suggests that readers may have an inflated sense of the number of people for whom this research is relevant. The article acknowledges the inclusion of cautionary statements from an independent expert and the importance of providing context.

It cautions against making broad claims based on limited evidence and emphasizes the importance of providing context and disclosure of potential conflicts of interest.",mixture,"This story highlights the novelty of an experimental diabetes treatment. Yet despite cautionary statements from an independent source, the story portrays a preliminary safety test as being much more than it is. The story also should have told readers that this approach to overcoming insulin resistance may not be relevant to the overwhelming majority of people with diabetes, who do not use insulin. It’s also a bit misleading for the story to call this a “clinical trial” since there were only 3 controls and 15 patients. The history of medical research is littered with examples of treatments that seemed highly beneficial when tested in small numbers of patients, but then turned out to cause serious harms or failed to sustain the benefits when tested in larger numbers of people. This test was so small that the patients were outnumbered by the authors of the journal article. It is simply too soon to put much stock in these preliminary findings.","The article discusses a novel stem cell treatment that may hold promise for Type 1 diabetes.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

95,95,5117,EPA boss visits polluted mining sites in Montana.,"Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler visited Butte and Anaconda in Montana with Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. Wheeler stated that Superfund is a priority for the administration and that cleanup plans for both sites are still in progress and community input could shape the final agreement. Butte is home to the Berkeley Pit, an open-pit copper mine holding 50 billion gallons of acidic, metal-laden water. In 2016, 3,000 snow geese died after landing in the pit. Anaconda's environmental damage was caused by a century's worth of copper smelting that released arsenic, lead, and other metals into the air until 1980. Both communities were placed on the EPA's Superfund list in 1983. In June, EPA officials announced a ""conceptual"" cleanup plan for Butte, but details have not been made public due to a gag order imposed by a federal judge in a pollution lawsuit. In July, the agency reached a preliminary agreement over pollution in Anaconda with Atlantic Richfield Co., the state of Montana, and Anaconda-Deer Lodge County. Senator Daines has been urging the EPA to accelerate the cleanup projects and believes Wheeler's visit demonstrates the agency's willingness to work with the communities. A recent study by researchers from the University of South Carolina found that residents of Butte and Anaconda continue to die from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other illnesses at higher rates than in other Montana counties. The study, based on an analysis of death certificate data from 2000 to 2016, suggests that cleanup work done to date is slowly improving the health impact of ongoing and historical pollution from mining and smelting.

These include the fact that the trial included only people who were able to adequately control their blood sugar levels and that the results may not apply to people who manage their diabetes by other methods. The article also does not mention the ties between the researchers and the manufacturers of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors. The disclosure summary included in the New England Journal of Medicine is 30 percent longer than the news report about the study. The article also fails to mention that the trial results apply only to people who are unable to achieve treatment goals with multiple daily insulin injections. The article does mention that people with diabetes can manage blood glucose levels with multiple daily injections, but it fails to mention that patients who could successfully manage their blood sugar levels without a pump were excluded from the study. The article also does not mention that effective glucose management requires expert training and guidance, which may not be readily available in general clinical practice. Overall, the article lacks important information about the costs, potential harms, limitations, and qualifications of insulin pumps, as well as the ties between the researchers and manufacturers. It also fails to mention that the trial results apply only to a specific group of people and that expert support services may be necessary for effective glucose management.

97,97,6559,Residents: Tests find toxic chemicals after Texas plant fire.,"Residents affected by the fire at the Arkema chemical plant in Texas have conducted scientific testing of samples and found toxic chemicals in the surrounding area. The residents' lawyers have accused Arkema of violating environmental protection laws due to unauthorized chemical spills and releases that occurred when the company failed to properly store and contain its organic peroxides before and after the facility was overwhelmed by six feet of water during Hurricane Harvey. The company has refused to disclose which chemicals were released during the fire and has been criticized for not providing information about its inventory quantities. Arkema is facing legal troubles, including a pending lawsuit and investigation by the civil attorney and criminal district attorney for Harris County. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and U.S. Chemical Safety Board are also investigating the incident. A group of homeowners and first responders are part of a state lawsuit seeking more than $1 million, blaming Arkema for their illnesses and failure to warn them about the hazards of breathing contaminated air. Arkema executives claim they had plans in place for flooding conditions, but the power and generators at the Crosby facility failed during Hurricane Harvey, causing the refrigeration systems to shut down and the organic peroxides to destabilize. The company abandoned the site and a mandatory evacuation zone was created. After containers storing hazardous materials caught fire and exploded, black plumes of smoke were released into the air. Scientific testing of samples collected both within and outside the evacuation zone found toxic chemicals, including volatile organic compounds and harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Some amount of dioxins and furans, which can change hormone levels, were also detected. The lawyers' letter states that the 1.5-mile evacuation zone was not sufficient to protect first responders and residents from the toxicity of the substances released. The exposure to the toxic mixture in the environment has caused bodily injury and the residents are calling for a community-wide remediation effort, changes in Arkema's operation, and a medical monitoring program to protect the public from risk. In 2016, an analysis by Texas A&M University researchers identified Arkema's facility as one of the biggest risks in a corridor with the highest concentration of petrochemical plants in the country.",true,"Tests detected toxic substances in soil, water and ash samples taken miles from a chemical plant that flooded during Hurricane Harvey, caught fire and partially exploded, nearly 20 Houston-area residents said Monday.","Residents affected by the fire at the Arkema chemical plant in Texas have conducted scientific testing of samples and found toxic chemicals in the surrounding area.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.

98,98,2917,FDA approves AstraZeneca type 2 diabetes drug.,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the type 2 diabetes drug, dapagliflozin, which will be sold in the United States under the brand name Farxiga. The drug was co-developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca. It belongs to a class of diabetes drugs called SGLT-2 inhibitors, which work by blocking reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increasing its excretion through urine to lower blood sugar levels. Farxiga will compete with a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson called Invokana, as well as other diabetes medicines. Analysts predict that Farxiga could reach annual sales of about $1.5 billion by 2018. The drug is expected to take market share from older diabetes treatments that cause weight gain, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to lead to weight loss in clinical trials. The potential market for type 2 diabetes treatments is large, with an estimated 90 to 95 percent of the more than 370 million people living with diabetes worldwide having type 2. Many type 2 diabetes patients require multiple medications to control their blood sugar levels. Farxiga was tested in combination with several other widely used medicines. The FDA initially rejected the drug in 2012 due to concerns about possible cancer and heart risks, but the companies provided additional data that addressed those concerns. However, as a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring six post-marketing studies, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial and a study to assess bladder cancer risk.

99,99,7422,White House moves toward promoting face masks to fight virus.,"The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus through speaking, as recent information suggests that it can be transmitted even when people are not coughing or sneezing. However, the recommendation is not intended to take away masks from healthcare providers who are in direct contact with infected patients. Medical-grade masks, especially N95 masks, will be reserved for those dealing directly with the sick. President Donald Trump indicated his support for the recommendation, and his latest coronavirus test came back negative. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern that the mask guidance could lead to a false sense of security for Americans. The discussions on face masks occurred as the White House defended its handling of the pandemic and its efforts to distribute ventilators and protective equipment to medical professionals. The White House also considered direct payments to hospitals to cover COVID-19 treatment costs for the uninsured. The emerging guidance on masks is expected to be more limited than a draft from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggested that the recommendation apply to nearly all Americans. The new proposal is driven by research showing that some infections are being spread by seemingly healthy people. Previously, only the sick or those at high risk of complications were advised to wear masks. The CDC recently changed its definition of the risk of infection for Americans, stating that anyone may be considered a carrier, whether or not they have symptoms.

Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern that the mask guidance could lead to a false sense of security for Americans. The discussions on face masks occurred as the White House defended its handling of the pandemic and its efforts to distribute ventilators and protective equipment to medical professionals. The White House also considered direct payments to hospitals to cover COVID-19 treatment costs for the uninsured. The emerging guidance on masks is expected to be more limited than a draft from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggested that the recommendation apply to nearly all Americans. The new proposal is driven by research showing that some infections are being spread by seemingly healthy people. Previously, only the sick or those at high risk of complications were advised to wear masks. The CDC recently changed its definition of the risk of infection for Americans, stating that anyone may be considered a carrier, whether or not they have symptoms. The virus primarily spreads through droplets from coughs or sneezes, but there is still uncertainty about whether it can also spread through smaller aerosolized particles. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that the general population does not need to wear masks unless they are sick or caring for someone who is sick.

The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus through speaking, as recent information suggests that it can be transmitted even when people are not coughing or sneezing. However, the recommendation is not intended to take away masks from healthcare providers who are in direct contact with infected patients.
