Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article discusses the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice that it has reached a settlement with Johnson & Johnson over allegations that the company paid kickbacks to doctors to promote its antipsychotic drug Risperdal. The settlement includes a $2.2 billion payment to the federal government and 46 states, as well as a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services. The article notes that the settlement is the largest ever for a civil case involving the False Claims Act, and that it resolves allegations that J&J and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. paid kickbacks to doctors to promote Risperdal for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The article also discusses the history of Risperdal, which was first approved by the FDA in 1993 for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and was later approved for the treatment of irritability in children with autism. The article notes that the settlement comes amidst a growing concern over the use of antipsychotic drugs in children, and that the FDA has warned that these drugs can cause serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, and even death.

The post specifically mentions retired players Antonio Cromartie, Travis Henry, Willis McGahee, Derrick Thomas, Bennie Blades, Ray Lewis, and Marshall Faulk, and highlights the number of children they have with multiple women. However, the post's premise that growing up in a single-parent household predicts criminal activity is false.

The article also mentions that violent crime rates have significantly decreased over the years, while the decline of marriage has continued. This challenges the theory that family breakdown drives crime rates. The argument that growing up in a single-parent household leads to criminal behavior is therefore questionable. Furthermore, none of the players mentioned in the Facebook post are currently active in the NFL.

The researchers found that women who used marijuana during pregnancy were more likely to have a preterm birth than women who did not use marijuana. The study also found that the risk of preterm birth increased with the frequency of marijuana use. The researchers noted that the study did not establish a causal relationship between marijuana use and preterm birth, but they suggested that the findings should be taken into consideration by women who are considering using marijuana during pregnancy.

3,3,17808,"Hank Johnson Says ""by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs.","Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson claims that by reducing chronic health care costs in the state, the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs can also be reduced. Johnson's claim is based on a study done by the Milken Institute in 2007, which found that more than half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases. The study focused on seven diseases, including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, mental disorder, pulmonary conditions, and strokes. In Georgia, the economic impact of these diseases was estimated to be $32.8 billion. The researchers calculated the number of lost workdays by using data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey and multiplying those days lost by wages per employee.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS.

Context: The article discusses the claim made by the Republican Party that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will lead to a $500 billion tax increase on the middle class. The article points out that the ACA does not include any new taxes on the middle class, and that the $500 billion figure is based on a tax on high-income individuals that was already in place before the ACA was passed. The article also notes that the tax on high-income individuals is not a new tax, but rather a tax increase on those who already pay the highest income tax rates. The article further explains that the ACA includes a number of tax credits and subsidies that will help offset the cost of health insurance for middle-class families. The article concludes that the Republican Party's claim that the ACA will lead to a $500 billion tax increase on the middle class is false, as the ACA does not include any new taxes on the middle class and the $500 billion figure is based on a tax on high-income individuals that was already in place before the ACA was passed.

6,6,5485,Trump administration drops Obama-era water protection rule.,"The Trump administration has repealed an Obama-era rule that defined the waterways subject to federal regulation. The 2015 Waters of the United States rule aimed to clarify which waterways were protected under the Clean Water Act. Environmental groups criticized the move, arguing that it would lead to less safe drinking water and damage to wetlands that prevent flooding and provide habitat for wildlife. The administration plans to adopt a new rule by the end of the year that is expected to define protected waterways more narrowly than the Obama policy. The Clean Water Act requires landowners to obtain federal permits before developing or polluting navigable waterways, but disputes have long persisted over what other waters are subject to regulation.

Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article discusses the recent decision by the Trump administration to roll back a rule that expanded the definition of which waterways are protected under the Clean Water Act. The rule, known as the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, was put in place by the Obama administration in 2015 and aimed to clarify which waterways are subject to federal regulation. The Trump administration's decision to roll back the rule has been met with criticism from environmental groups and some state governments, who argue that it will lead to less protection for waterways and could have negative impacts on public health and the environment. The article provides examples of how the rollback could affect specific waterways, such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes, and discusses the potential consequences of reduced regulation, including increased pollution and decreased water quality. The article also highlights the political implications of the decision, with some arguing that it is part of a larger pattern of environmental deregulation by the Trump administration. The article concludes by noting that the rollback of the WOTUS rule is likely to be challenged in court and could face legal challenges from environmental groups and state governments.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

10,10,2791,Drug critic slams FDA over antibiotic oversight in meat production.,"The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a non-governmental group that criticizes the use of drugs in the meat industry, has conducted a study that raises concerns over the use of antibiotics in meat production. The study found that the FDA did not take action to remove 30 antibiotic-based livestock feed products from the market, even after federal investigators determined that many of these antibiotics did not meet current regulatory standards for protecting human health. The FDA had previously unveiled guidelines for drug makers and agricultural companies to voluntarily phase out antibiotic use as a growth enhancer in livestock, in an effort to combat the surge in human resistance to certain antibiotics. However, the NRDC's study suggests that the FDA has not effectively enforced these guidelines. The NRDC's study focused on a review conducted by the FDA from 2001 to 2010, which examined 30 penicillin and tetracycline-based antibiotic feed additives that had been approved for use in livestock and poultry to promote growth. The study found evidence to suggest that nine of these drugs are still on the market and used by livestock producers. One of the drugs still on the market is Zoetis Inc's Penicillin G Procaine 50/100, which is fed to poultry to aid in weight gain. The NRDC claims that the FDA twice expressed concerns to Zoetis about the drug failing to meet safety regulations. Some academics specializing in antibiotic resistance have criticized the NRDC's study, arguing that it does not reflect current regulatory standards as some of the drugs have been withdrawn from the market and the study assessed outdated FDA safety guidelines. However, the NRDC argues that its findings raise questions about the effectiveness of regulators in enforcing the new guidelines. The FDA has stated that it began reviewing older, approved penicillin and tetracycline products in 2001 and issued letters to companies asking for additional safety data. The agency claims to have employed a strategy to address concerns about the production use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals. The FDA believes that its current strategy is the most efficient and effective way to change the use of these products in animal agriculture. Overall, the NRDC's study highlights concerns over the FDA's oversight of antibiotic use in meat production and raises questions about the effectiveness of the agency's guidelines and enforcement.",true,"The United States Food and Drug Administration allowed 18 animal drugs to stay on the market even after an agency review found the drugs posed a “high risk” of exposing humans to antibiotic-resistant bacteria through food supply, according to a study released Monday by the Natural Resources Defense Council.","The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a non-governmental group that criticizes the use of drugs in the meat industry, has conducted a study that raises concerns over the use of antibiotics in meat production.

11,11,4978,Study challenges health benefits of moderate drinking.,"A study conducted in China challenges the belief that moderate drinking has health benefits. The researchers found that moderate drinking slightly increases the risk of stroke and high blood pressure. However, they were unable to determine if small amounts of alcohol also increase the chances of a heart attack. The study tracked over 500,000 people in China for a decade and recorded their medical history, including their alcohol consumption. The researchers took genetics into account by focusing on two variants common among East Asians that can make drinking unpleasant. For those with the variants, drinking alcohol can result in symptoms such as turning red, a fast heart rate, nausea, or headaches. The researchers found that alcohol increases the risk of stroke by about one-third for every four additional drinks per day. They also found no protective effects for moderate drinking. People who drink up to two drinks a day, which qualifies as moderate drinking, have an increased stroke risk of about 10% to 15% compared to nondrinkers. However, there were not enough heart attacks among the participants to draw a conclusion about heart risks. The study's senior author, Richard Peto of the University of Oxford, stated that the claims of alcohol having a protective effect have no serious scientific basis. He also mentioned that the findings should apply to other populations beyond China and to any alcoholic drinks, even though the study participants mostly drank spirits. In a journal commentary, the authors of the study called for stricter controls on alcohol, stating that its risks have been underestimated. They compared the alcohol industry to the tobacco industry and suggested that it should be regulated similarly.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The tiny community of Beauregard, near the Alabama-Georgia border, is mourning the loss of 23 people who were killed by tornadoes over the weekend. The victims ranged in age from 6 to 93 years old, and included four children and seven people from one family. Most of the deceased were found near their homes. Search crews have narrowed their focus to the most affected areas and hope to transition from a search and rescue effort to a recovery effort soon. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced plans to visit the devastated areas on Friday. The tornadoes, caused by a late-winter ""supercell"" thunderstorm, had winds of 170 mph and caused significant damage to mobile homes and trees. The Beauregard community may have had as little as eight or nine minutes to seek shelter after the warning was issued. In addition to the 23 confirmed deaths, over 50 people were reported injured, making this the deadliest tornado outbreak since 2013.

The article explains that early on in the pandemic, there were baseless claims linking the disease to the consumption of bats in China. The Instagram post from the account for ""Cowspiracy"" piggybacks on this misinformation. It refers to a vegan activist's post that cites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to support the claim that meat consumption caused the COVID-19 outbreak. However, neither statement from the CDC nor the WHO supports the link between COVID-19 and meat-eating. Scientists are still investigating the source of COVID-19, but there is no evidence that it started because of meat consumption. The CDC states that most new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals, but this does not specifically link COVID-19 to meat-eating. COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus similar to MERS and SARS, and all three originate in bats. The recent outbreak suggests a likely single, recent emergence of the virus from an animal reservoir. While early cases in Wuhan, China, had connections to a seafood and live-animal market, later cases had no connection to the market, indicating person-to-person spread. Studies suggest that intermediate hosts are needed for the disease to spread from bats to humans, but meat consumption is not necessarily part of the equation. For example, the Ebola outbreak was initially thought to be linked to the consumption of bat meat, but it was later discovered that patient zero was likely infected through bat droppings. MERS was primarily spread through contact with live camels rather than camel meat. Recent studies suggest that pangolins could be an intermediate host for COVID-19, but conclusive proof has not been found. Pangolins are sought-after in China for their meat and scales, despite a worldwide ban. However, there is currently no evidence that eating meat is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, the claim that ""COVID-19 started because we eat animals"" is not supported by scientific evidence.

14,14,25802,Allen West Says the coronavirus has a “99.9% recovery rate” in Texas.,"Retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West, the newly elected chairman of the Texas Republican Party, claimed that the recovery rate for COVID-19 in Texas is 99.9%. However, this claim is inaccurate. At the time of West's statement on July 27, Texas had reported 385,923 positive COVID-19 cases and 5,713 deaths. The state has since corrected the number of fatalities for that day to 5,489. West's numbers for positive cases and deaths are outdated, and his calculation for the recovery rate is incorrect. West's calculation of the recovery rate involved dividing the number of people in Texas who did not die after testing positive for COVID-19 by the entire population of Texas. However, this method is flawed. Calculating the recovery rate should involve counting the number of people who have been infected with COVID-19 and the number of those who have recovered. The latest numbers would put the recovery rate closer to 98.7%. Furthermore, West's definition of recovery as all those who tested positive and did not die is one way to describe it, but it may not be the most accurate. Research has shown that ""recovered"" patients can still have impaired organ function and abnormal blood test results even after they are no longer infectious. Doctors and researchers have raised concerns about the long-term impact of COVID-19. Different states use distinct formulas to calculate the recovery rate, and it has been a point of friction for some public officials. In Texas, the state produces an estimate based on hospitalizations and average stays. West's claim of a 99.9% recovery rate could be misleading and dangerous, as it may give people a false impression that most infected individuals return to their previous state of health. This could lead to a decrease in efforts to stop the spread of the virus. In conclusion, West's claim of a 99.9% recovery rate for COVID-19 in Texas is inaccurate.

15,15,11154,Prostate Cancer Drug Gets Lukewarm Review,"The article discusses the lukewarm review of the prostate cancer drug, Provenge. It mentions that the treatment costs $93,000 per patient, but fails to provide context by comparing it to alternative treatments. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine states that alternative treatments cost $1,800 per patient. The article also mentions that in clinical trials, Provenge extended the lives of certain men with advanced prostate cancer by about four months. However, it fails to mention that expert reviewers who analyzed the evidence for Medicare found the actual quantity of the benefit to be ""less certain"" due to weaknesses in the trials. This raises questions about the accuracy of the ""four months"" additional survival estimate. Furthermore, the article does not mention the potential harms associated with Provenge. Clinical trials reported infusion reactions, infections, and the FDA ordered further study of strokes in people who receive Provenge. The article also fails to adequately explain the shortcomings identified by expert reviewers in the trial design of Provenge. The reviewers rated the quality of evidence on survival as only ""fair"" and recommended further trials to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of Provenge. The article does not mention the differences in disease progression time between patients receiving Provenge and those in the control group, nor does it address the potential interactions between Provenge and other treatments. Although the article mentions that Provenge is approved for patients with advanced prostate cancer resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy, it does not include an independent source addressing the scientific issues raised by the Medicare analysis. Additionally, the article does not disclose that the cancer advocacy group cited in the article receives support from and promotes its services to health care corporations, including pharmaceutical companies. The article also fails to mention other treatment approaches for advanced prostate cancer, despite the Medicare analysis highlighting questions about the influence of other treatments, including chemotherapy, on the outcomes of Provenge trials. In conclusion, the article provides a lukewarm review of Provenge but lacks important context, fails to address potential harms, and does not adequately explain the shortcomings identified by expert reviewers. It also lacks independent sources and does not mention alternative treatment approaches.",mixture,"This story reports on an analysis done for the agency that oversees Medicare of the evidence of the effects of Provenge (sipuleucel-T) in certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It summarizes some of the conclusions and includes comments about how the analysis might influence a decision about whether Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the expensive new treatment. But the story leaves readers with the impression that the drug has been proven to extend the life of the average patient by about four months when actually there are many uncertainties about that estimate due to weaknesses in the clinical trials sponsored by the maker of the Provenge. The assessment done for Medicare underscores the questions that still need to be answered in order for doctors and patients to know whether and how to use Provenge, but that perspective is largely missing from this story. This story portrays debates about insurance coverage of Provenge as a matter of how much value to place on four months of life. But what the federal analysis of the Provenge trials actually focuses on is uncertainty about the amount of additional survival and questions about how other factors besides Provenge (including other treatments that were given to the trial participants) might have affected the trial results. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer occurring in men, though most tumors grow slowly and men diagnosed with the disease typically die of something other than their prostate cancer. Some tumors are aggressive and more effective treatments are needed for these cases. Provenge’s novel immunotherapy approach offers an attractive alternative to existing treatments, but the initial application for FDA approval was rejected in 2007. A new clinical trial was done and the treatment was approved for sale in the U.S. earlier this year. Although historically Medicare and Medicaid have covered treatments deemed safe and effective without considering the magnitude of the expected benefit, the limited additional survival and the high cost of Provenge treatment have highlighted debates about whether and how to consider these factors in deciding whether a particular treatment should be reimbursed.","The article discusses the lukewarm review of the prostate cancer drug, Provenge. It mentions that the treatment costs $93,000 per patient, but fails to provide context by comparing it to alternative treatments. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine states that alternative treatments cost $1,800 per patient.

The article also mentions that in clinical trials, Provenge extended the lives of certain men with advanced prostate cancer by about four months. However, it fails to mention that expert reviewers who analyzed the evidence for Medicare found the actual quantity of the benefit to be ""less certain"" due to weaknesses in the trials. This raises questions about the accuracy of the ""four months"" additional survival estimate.

Furthermore, the article does not mention the potential harms associated with Provenge. Clinical trials reported infusion reactions, infections, and the FDA ordered further study of strokes in people who receive Provenge.

The article also fails to adequately explain the shortcomings identified by expert reviewers in the trial design of Provenge. The reviewers rated the quality of evidence on survival as only ""fair"" and recommended further trials to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of Provenge. The article does not mention the differences in disease progression time between patients receiving Provenge and those in the control group, nor does it address the potential interactions between Provenge and other treatments.

Although the article mentions that Provenge is approved for patients with advanced prostate cancer resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy, it does not include an independent source addressing the scientific issues raised by the Medicare analysis.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

16,16,5909,Minnesota environmentalists aren’t excited about DFL’s wins.,"Environmental organizations in Minnesota are not optimistic about the future of two controversial natural resource projects in the state: PolyMet's proposed copper-nickel mine and the plan to replace an aging Enbridge oil pipeline. Despite supporting many other causes championed by environmentalists, it is unlikely that the newly elected DFLer Tim Walz, who succeeded Governor Mark Dayton, will significantly change course on these projects. The PolyMet project recently received key environmental permits from the Department of Natural Resources, a decision celebrated by those who see it as a source of jobs. However, environmentalists are concerned about the potential pollution of Lake Superior and the surrounding watershed. Governor Dayton has opposed the Enbridge project, and his Department of Commerce has been vocal in its opposition. Although he vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline to move forward without typical approval, the Public Utilities Commission approved the project in June. Walz, as governor, will not have the power to unilaterally stop either project, but his opposition could influence state agencies that need to approve permits for Enbridge. Some environmental groups believe that a new Department of Natural Resources under Walz could restart the environmental review process for PolyMet based on the assertion that the company plans to build a larger mine than proposed. Walz maintains that both projects should move forward if they meet state environmental standards. However, he emphasizes the need for meaningful engagement with tribes affected by the Enbridge project, particularly those opposed to it. The frustration of environmental groups in Minnesota highlights their lack of political influence on these projects and the divide within the DFL between those supporting economic development and those concerned about environmental damage. While environmentalists still support much of Walz's agenda, they will continue to fight against the PolyMet and Enbridge projects through lawsuits, protests, and lobbying.

The program, which was created by the Obama administration in 2012, provided temporary protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration's decision to end the program was lawful, but it did not address the underlying question of whether the program was legal in the first place. The decision has left many DACA recipients and their supporters feeling frustrated and uncertain about their future. The article highlights the stories of several DACA recipients who have built lives in the United States and are now facing the possibility of deportation. The article also discusses the political implications of the decision, with some Democrats calling for Congress to pass legislation to protect DACA recipients. The article notes that the Supreme Court's decision does not mean that DACA recipients will be immediately deported, but it does mean that they will no longer be able to renew their work permits or protection from deportation.

18,18,11578,Blood-Pressure Drugs Linked to Birth Defects,"A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that the use of ACE inhibitors, a class of blood-pressure drugs, during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects. The study analyzed data from over 465,000 infants born between 1995 and 2008, and found that the rate of birth defects was nearly tripled in women who had taken ACE inhibitors during the first trimester. The article highlights the risks of using ACE inhibitors during pregnancy, specifically in the first trimester. It mentions that the study did not quantify the possible benefits to the mother for using this drug during pregnancy, but emphasizes that the harms to the fetus are clearly mentioned. However, it fails to mention the risks of not using ACE inhibitors in certain populations, such as women with congestive heart failure or diabetes. The article also discusses the impact of pregnancy on blood pressure, stating that it can either lower or raise blood pressure in women. It notes that ACE inhibitors have been commonly prescribed since the early 1980s and have been used by pregnant women, although the number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but likely small. The story presents the rate of birth defects for women not taking blood pressure medication as 2.6%, while the actual data from the journal article reports a rate of 1.98%.

Although ACE inhibitors have been used for 25 years, the potential risk to human fetuses during the first third of pregnancy had not been explicitly studied. The article would have been improved if it had included the fact that there may also be risks associated with not using ACE inhibitors for some women, such as those with congestive heart failure or diabetes. Overall, this story was very well written and reported.","A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that the use of ACE inhibitors, a class of blood-pressure drugs, during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects. The study analyzed data from over 465,000 infants born between 1995 and 2008, and found that the rate of birth defects was nearly tripled in women who had taken ACE inhibitors during the first trimester.

The article highlights the risks of using ACE inhibitors during pregnancy, specifically in the first trimester. It mentions that the study did not quantify the possible benefits to the mother for using this drug during pregnancy, but emphasizes that the harms to the fetus are clearly mentioned.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article discusses the recent announcement by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) that it will not defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in a lawsuit brought by 20 Republican-led states. The lawsuit, which was filed in February 2020, argues that the ACA is unconstitutional because the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, is no longer in effect. The DOJ's decision not to defend the ACA has raised concerns about the future of the law, which provides health insurance to millions of Americans. The article notes that the DOJ's decision is not surprising, given that the Trump administration has been critical of the ACA and has taken steps to undermine it. The article also points out that the DOJ's decision does not mean that the ACA is automatically invalidated, as the lawsuit will still need to be heard by a federal court. The article discusses the potential impact of the lawsuit on the ACA, including the possibility that it could lead to the law being struck down or significantly altered. The article also notes that the lawsuit is just one of many legal challenges facing the ACA, and that the future of the law remains uncertain.

20,20,8892,Merck Says Thousands File for Vioxx Payments.,"Merck has announced that thousands of people have filed for payments in the program to resolve heart attack and stroke claims related to their arthritis pill, Vioxx. The company withdrew Vioxx from the market in 2004 after research showed that it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who took it for at least 18 months. Over 20 million people in the United States had used the drug, resulting in tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits against Merck. According to Merck, out of the 47,000 people who registered eligible injuries, about 44,000 have submitted the necessary documents to qualify for an interim payment. These payments are part of a settlement agreement reached in November, which requires Merck to meet an 85 percent threshold for receiving enrollment documents in various claims categories. If this threshold is met, Merck will be obligated to pay $4.85 billion in installments into a resolution fund. Merck stated that 5,500 eligible claimants alleging death from heart attack and stroke have initiated enrollment, along with over 26,500 eligible claimants alleging more than 12 months of use. However, the eligibility of another 5,000 claimants who have sought to enroll still needs to be determined. Despite this, Merck expects to meet all enrollment thresholds. To cover the cost of the settlement agreement, Merck recorded a pretax charge of $4.85 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. The company's shares were trading slightly lower at $44.23 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

The study analyzed data from the Department of Veterans Affairs and found that the suicide rate among veterans in rural areas was 1.5 times higher than in urban areas. The study also found that the suicide rate among veterans in the western United States was 1.3 times higher than in other regions. The study's authors suggest that the higher suicide rate in rural areas and the western United States may be due to a lack of access to mental health care and other resources. The study's findings are significant because they highlight the need for improved mental health care and suicide prevention efforts in rural areas and the western United States. The study's authors call for increased funding for mental health care and suicide prevention programs in these areas. The study's findings are also significant because they highlight the need for improved access to mental health care and suicide prevention programs for veterans.

The rule, set to take effect on July 22, would expand protections for healthcare workers who refuse to provide certain medical services based on their religious or moral beliefs. The lawsuits argue that the rule could undermine the ability of states and cities to provide effective healthcare without jeopardizing federal aid and could impede procedures such as sterilizations and assisted suicide. Critics of the rule, including civil rights medical groups, argue that it could deprive certain patients, including gay and transgender individuals, of necessary healthcare. The lawsuits also claim that the rule could prevent hospitals from asking nursing job applicants about their stance on giving measles vaccinations, even during an outbreak.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article discusses the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the Trump administration to enforce a new rule that would make it easier for employers to deny birth control coverage to their employees. The rule, which was finalized in November 2018, allows employers to claim a religious or moral objection to providing contraceptive coverage to their employees. The Supreme Court's decision means that the rule can go into effect while legal challenges to it are pending. The rule has been criticized by women's rights groups and Democrats, who argue that it will result in fewer women having access to birth control and that it violates the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers provide contraceptive coverage. The Trump administration has defended the rule, arguing that it protects religious freedom and that employers should not be forced to provide coverage for services that violate their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court's decision is a setback for women's rights advocates, who had hoped to block the rule while legal challenges to it were pending. The decision also highlights the importance of the Supreme Court in shaping policy and the potential impact of future Supreme Court appointments.

The article also notes that the decision has been met with legal challenges, with several states and advocacy groups filing lawsuits to block the administration's action.

The article also discusses the political implications of the decision, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of using DACA as a bargaining chip in negotiations over immigration reform.

27,27,12753,"Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness.","A Florida physician specializing in geriatrics and memory care testified before a Florida Senate committee, warning that Alzheimer's disease is a significant problem for the state. Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, stated that there is currently an epidemic of Alzheimer's disease in Florida, with half a million residents affected. She also projected that within the next 10 years, the number of Floridians with Alzheimer's will increase by 40 percent, resulting in an additional 200,000 cases. Laird's claims were supported by statistics from the ""2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures"" report by the Alzheimer's Association. The report provided estimates for the number of residents with Alzheimer's in each state for 2017 and projected numbers for 2025. For Florida, the report estimated 520,000 cases in 2017 and projected 720,000 cases in 2025, which closely align with Laird's statements. However, it is important to note that these figures are estimates and projections, as indicated in the report. The numbers were derived from a study published in the academic journal Neurology in 2013, which used Alzheimer's diagnosis statistics from 2010 to make future predictions until 2050. Due to the inherent uncertainties and margins of error in estimates and projections, it is an overreach to present these figures as precise numbers of Floridians currently affected by the disease.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article discusses the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, which suggest that the use of marijuana may be associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The study, which was published in the journal ""Neurobiology of Disease,"" analyzed data from 1,037 participants in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study. The researchers found that those who reported using marijuana at least once a week had a 26% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those who had never used marijuana. The study also found that the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease was lower among those who started using marijuana before the age of 18. The researchers believe that the protective effects of marijuana may be due to its ability to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow to the brain. However, the study has some limitations, including the fact that it was based on self-reported data and did not include a control group. The article also notes that more research is needed to confirm the findings and determine the exact mechanisms by which marijuana may protect against Alzheimer's disease.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

In 2010, Stevenson was brought to Bernard Mevs hospital in Port-au-Prince, where an orthopedic team was fitting prosthetic limbs for amputees after an earthquake. However, they were unable to help Stevenson due to his congenital condition. Last year, John Marshall and his wife Lisa met Stevenson at the Little Children of Jesus orphanage in Haiti and decided to help him. They read about Richard van As, a South African man who developed a 3-D printed prosthetic hand called ""Robohand"" after losing his fingers in an accident. Marshall and van As worked together to design a 3-D printed prosthesis for Stevenson. After three attempts, the prosthesis was ready and shipped to Haiti, where it was fitted onto Stevenson's left hand by the medical team at Bernard Mevs hospital. The 3-D printed prosthesis is more anatomical and allows for more motion than traditional custom-made prosthetics. It also only costs around $300 to print once the model is designed. Stevenson is now getting used to his new hand and is able to do activities such as playing catch, scoring at basketball, and holding objects like a TV remote and water bottle. The 3-D device is articulated by Stevenson's wrist and makes a slight creaking plastic sound when moving.

32,32,7422,White House moves toward promoting face masks to fight virus.,"The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus through speaking, as recent information suggests that it can be transmitted even when people are not coughing or sneezing. However, the recommendation is not intended to take away masks from healthcare providers who are in direct contact with infected patients. Medical-grade masks, especially N95 masks, will be reserved for those dealing directly with the sick. President Donald Trump indicated his support for the recommendation, and his latest coronavirus test came back negative. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern that the mask guidance could lead to a false sense of security for Americans. The discussions on face masks occurred as the White House defended its handling of the pandemic and its efforts to distribute ventilators and protective equipment to medical professionals. The White House also considered direct payments to hospitals to cover COVID-19 treatment costs for the uninsured. The emerging guidance on masks is expected to be more limited than a draft from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggested that the recommendation apply to nearly all Americans. The new proposal is driven by research showing that some infections are being spread by seemingly healthy people. Previously, only the sick or those at high risk of complications were advised to wear masks. The CDC recently changed its definition of the risk of infection for Americans, stating that anyone may be considered a carrier, whether or not they have symptoms. The virus primarily spreads through droplets from coughs or sneezes, but there is still uncertainty about whether it can also spread through smaller aerosolized particles. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that the general population does not need to wear masks unless they are sick or caring for someone who is sick.",true,The Trump administration is formalizing new guidance to recommend that many Americans wear face coverings in an effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus as the president defends his response to the crisis.,"The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19.

The Supreme Court's decision to allow the rule to take effect was met with criticism from Democrats and immigrant advocates, who argued that it would create a ""chilling effect"" on immigrants who are eligible for public benefits but may now be afraid to apply for them out of fear of being denied a green card. The rule is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to restrict immigration to the United States, including through the implementation of a ""public charge"" rule that would deny green cards to immigrants who are deemed likely to become a burden on the U.S. government. The Supreme Court's decision to allow the new rule to take effect is seen as a victory for the Trump administration, which has made restricting immigration a key part of its agenda. However, the decision is also likely to face legal challenges in the future, as it is","White House moves toward promoting face masks to fight virus"" "

The article examines McAfee's argument and provides information to refute it. The ""Presidential alert"" is a nationwide test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) system conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

McAfee argues that the WEA notification could be exploited by the government to spy on citizens by accessing the E911 chip, which he claims is present in cell phones. However, according to Ted Rappaport, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU, there is no such thing as an E911 chip in a cell phone.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS.

Context: The article discusses the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The court ruled that the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, is constitutional. The court also ruled that the rest of the law can stand, even if the individual mandate is struck down. The article examines the implications of the decision and how it will affect Americans. The court's decision means that the Affordable Care Act will remain in place, providing health insurance to millions of Americans who would otherwise be uninsured. The law also includes provisions that prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and require them to cover essential health benefits. The court's decision is a victory for President Obama and Democrats, who have been fighting to keep the law in place. Republicans, who have been trying to repeal the law since it was passed in 2010, are disappointed with the decision. The article also discusses the political implications of the decision and how it will affect the upcoming presidential election.

One of the main concerns is the workforce, as Iowa has a low unemployment rate and high labor force participation rate, making it difficult for businesses to find workers. The government aims to attract more people to work in the state and bring in workers from outside as well. Child care is also a significant topic, as it affects workforce discussions. Parents are more likely to take full-time jobs if they have affordable child care options. However, government programs that offset child care expenses are often limited by income, which poses challenges for families with multiple children. Ensuring the quality and accessibility of child care is another important aspect.

The focus is on allocating the additional revenue to water quality and recreation, as well as determining the use of the remaining funds. Republicans are only considering tax changes that would lower taxes. Mental health funding is another priority, with the aim of creating dedicated funds for children seeking help for mental health issues. Historically, mental health care has been funded through property taxes, but there is a need to explore alternative sustainable revenue sources and potentially lower property taxes. Governor Reynolds will push for a constitutional amendment to allow felons to vote once they have completed their sentences. Currently, Iowa is the only state that requires felons to seek voting right restoration from the governor. However, this proposal may face opposition in the Iowa Senate. Efforts to increase penalties for animal abuse and regulate the pet breeding industry are expected to be revisited in this legislative session.

Context: Governor Kim Reynolds will address the state's priorities in her Condition of the State address, focusing on several key issues. One of the main concerns is the workforce, as Iowa has a low unemployment rate and high labor force participation rate, making it difficult for businesses to find workers. The government aims to attract more people to work in the state and bring in workers from outside as well. Child care is also a significant topic, as it affects workforce discussions. Parents are more likely to take full-time jobs if they have affordable child care options. However, government programs that offset child care expenses are often limited by income, which poses challenges for families with multiple children. Ensuring the quality and accessibility of child care is another important aspect. Tax discussions will likely include raising the state sales tax by 1% to fund a water quality program that was approved by voters in 2010 but never funded. The focus is on allocating the additional revenue to water quality and recreation, as well as determining the use of the remaining funds. Republicans are only considering tax changes that would lower taxes. Mental health funding is another priority, with the aim of creating dedicated funds for children seeking help for mental health issues. Historically, mental health care has been funded through property taxes, but there is a need to explore alternative sustainable revenue sources and potentially lower property taxes. Governor Reynolds will push for a constitutional amendment to allow felons to vote once they have completed their sentences. Currently, Iowa is the only state that requires felons to seek voting right restoration from the governor. However, this proposal may face opposition in the Iowa Senate. Efforts to increase penalties for animal abuse and regulate the pet breeding industry are expected to be revisited in this legislative session. There is significant public support for such measures, and lawmakers aim to be responsive to the wishes of Iowans. Legislators will also discuss proposals to boost job prospects and quality of life in rural areas, including addressing the closure of rural hospitals and improving broadband coverage. Social issues such as abortion regulations and welfare requirements are likely to be debated, with Republicans potentially proposing a constitutional amendment to reverse the Iowa Supreme Court's ruling on abortion rights and introducing bills related to welfare and capital punishment. Overall, the article highlights the key issues that will be addressed in the Iowa Legislature, including workforce, child care, taxes, mental health funding, felon voting rights, animal abuse, rural Iowa, and social issues.

Context: The article discusses the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice that it will not pursue charges against former FBI Director James Comey for his handling of classified information. The article notes that Comey's lawyers had argued that the FBI director's actions were consistent with the agency's policies and that he had not intended to violate the law. The article also highlights the fact that Comey had been under investigation for his handling of classified information since 2018, when the Justice Department's inspector general found that he had mishandled classified information in his memos about his conversations with President Donald Trump. The article notes that the decision not to pursue charges against Comey is a significant development in the ongoing investigation into the Trump administration's ties to Russia. The article also discusses the ongoing investigation into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe, which has been a focus of Trump and his allies. The article notes that the decision not to pursue charges against Comey is likely to be seen as a victory for Trump and his allies, who have long argued that Comey's actions were politically motivated and that he should be held accountable for his actions. The article also discusses the ongoing legal battles between the Justice Department and Congress over the release of documents related to the Russia investigation","Iowa Legislature back to talk taxes, workers, child care"" "

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax.

Trump praised his administration's response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Irma in Florida, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) acknowledged that it was caught short-handed when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico. Emergency supplies had been diverted from Puerto Rico to help victims of Hurricane Irma. Trump's praise for his administration's response to Hurricane Maria drew criticism due to the high number of estimated deaths attributed to the storm. The Milken Institute School of Public Health released a report estimating that there were 2,975 ""excess deaths in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria"" over a six-month period. Trump falsely claimed that the higher death estimate was done by Democrats to make him look bad. The study was an independent study commissioned by Puerto Rico and conducted by researchers at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health. The researchers did an ""excess mortality study"" and estimated that 2,975 excess deaths were related to Hurricane Maria. Trump also misrepresented the study's methodology, claiming it counted deaths ""for any reason, like old age."" The researchers used a state-of-the-art mathematical model to estimate excess deaths, taking into account the usual number of deaths that could be expected during that time period. The 2,975 figure is not an exact count of hurricane-related deaths, but the researchers are 95 percent confident that the number falls between 2,658 and 3,290. Trump ignored the number of indirect hurricane-related deaths that occurred after the storm, as opposed to those directly caused by the storm. The National Hurricane Center also considers indirect deaths and attempts to count them. The death toll in Puerto Rico was initially estimated to be 64 deaths, but the official number was considered too low. The National Hurricane Center stated that there could be hundreds of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths. Experts agree that the methodology used by the researchers at the Milken Institute School of Public Health was reasonable. The study used tried and true methodologies to estimate the death toll, which will have some uncertainty. The Milken Institute School of Public Health stood by its findings and stated that the number of 2,975 is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date. It is unclear what Trump meant when he claimed to have successfully raised billions of dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico.

Context: The article debunks a Facebook post claiming that there are two possible cases of coronavirus at Valley Regional Medical Center in Brownsville, Texas. The post appears to be a screenshot of another post published by the account Brownsville Online, but there is no evidence of such claims on their page. Health officials in the area have stated that there are no cases of coronavirus in the Rio Grande Valley, and Hidalgo County's health and human services department specifically called out social media posts for spreading misinformation. As of March 3, Texas was not one of the 12 states reporting cases of COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Local news station KRGV also confirmed that Cameron County health officials stated there were no cases of the virus in the area. The Valley Regional Medical Center also released a statement saying they do not have any patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.

Context: The article discusses the recent arrest of a man in New York City who was caught on video punching a woman in the face. The video, which has gone viral on social media, shows the man punching the woman in the face multiple times before being restrained by bystanders. The woman was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The man, identified as 24-year-old Michael Lynch, was arrested and charged with assault and harassment. The incident occurred on a subway platform in the Bronx. The article also discusses the recent rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans in the United States, and how the coronavirus pandemic has contributed to this increase. The article cites a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, which found that hate crimes against Asian Americans increased by 150% in 2020 compared to the previous year. The article also discusses the importance of speaking out against hate and discrimination, and the need for increased awareness and education about the issue.

42,42,9168,Common antibiotic may help to prevent or treat PTSD,"The article discusses a study that suggests a common antibiotic, doxycycline, may be effective in preventing or treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study found that volunteers taking the antibiotic had a 60% lower fear response compared to those who took a placebo. However, the article criticizes the news release for not providing information about the costs of the treatment or the statistical strength of the results. It also points out that the release does not mention the potential side effects and drug interactions associated with the use of doxycycline. The article suggests that more information about the strengths and weaknesses of the research should have been included in the release. It also notes that the release does not provide context about the rate of PTSD in certain populations or other treatment strategies for the condition. The article mentions that another drug, propranolol, has also been studied for its use in blocking fear learning. The release claims novelty in the treatment strategy, but the article argues that other drugs have been identified for this purpose before. Overall, the article criticizes the release for not providing enough information and context about the study and its implications.",false,"This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the enzymes. The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is. The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn’t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur. The search for the neurochemical and biological roots of PTSD and other kinds of crippling anxieties is a scientific challenge for good reason. The human “mind” is difficult to access; animal models are notoriously unreliable; and experiments on people designed to induce, evoke, or otherwise probe such trauma may be unethical. The work described here may indeed be an important early step in understanding the role of signaling pathways outside of nerve cells in creating PTSD, and of novel strategies using an already widely available set of drugs to sabotage that role. But a lot more research will be needed to affirm the idea and a release on the research should make that point very clear and very high up in the text. When and if the blocking of a conditioned fear response by a drug is proven, who would want to take a long term drug in case a terrible event befalls them in the future? That would be taking “preventive medicine” to a whole new level.","The article discusses a study that suggests a common antibiotic, doxycycline, may be effective in preventing or treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance.

43,43,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs. In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative. The DCYF expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs, indicating that his concern about the expenditure of taxpayer dollars is valid.",true,Rep.

Context: The claim states that an image circulating on social media, supposedly showing a Japanese Giant Emperor Moth, is actually a figurine made by artist Yumi Okita. The artist describes her artwork as a series of botanical and insect fiber sculptures, created using hand-painted cotton fabric embroidered with layers of threads to create texture and color. The specific piece in question is stated to be 6 inches tall and 12 inches wide, with wings made from hand-painted fabric embroidered with layers of thread. The article confirms that the viral image does not depict a Japanese Giant Emperor Moth but was inspired by a genuine species called the Hemileuca eglanterina, also known as the sheep moth. Okita mentions that while she aims to capture the realism of nature, she incorporates imagination into her pieces. The article provides a glimpse of an actual sheep moth for comparison. The article further explains that there is no known species called the ""Japanese Giant Emperor Moth,"" although there are similar species such as the Japanese giant silkworm moth and the Japanese emperor butterfly. The article includes images of the silkworm and butterfly for reference. In summary, the claim is accurate in stating that the image circulating on social media does not show a Japanese Giant Emperor Moth. Instead, it is a figurine created by artist Yumi Okita, who specializes in botanical and insect fiber sculptures. The image was inspired by the sheep moth, not a Japanese Giant Emperor Moth.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance.

47,47,5700,Hogan announces environmental agreement with dam operator.,"Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has announced an environmental agreement with Exelon, the operator of the Conowingo Dam. The agreement aims to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials are also concerned about sediment buildup behind the dam's walls, which could be released and harm the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The proposed settlement includes $52 million to implement new requirements for flow control in the Lower Susquehanna River, creating more natural conditions. It also includes $41 million to increase efforts to remove trash and debris that flows down the Susquehanna from upstream states. Additionally, $47 million will be allocated for climate resiliency projects, such as submerged aquatic vegetation, clams, oysters, and the restoration of living shorelines. Another $25 million will be used to restore mussels in the Susquehanna. Exelon's president and CEO, Chris Crane, expressed a commitment to restoring and sustaining the health of the Chesapeake Bay, stating that the agreement strengthens this commitment. However, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) expressed concerns that the settlement does not adequately mitigate the negative water quality impact associated with operating the dam. The CBF believes that a majority of the funding should be spent on upstream practices to reduce sediments and pollution reaching the dam. The agreement settles Exelon's legal challenges to the water quality certification issued last year under the Clean Water Act and avoids years of litigation. Exelon has argued that it is unfair to make the company pay for pollution that the dam does not produce. The proposed settlement also includes $500,000 for a study on management options for dredged material. Scientific reports confirm that the dam has reached full capacity and can no longer effectively prevent pollution from entering the Chesapeake Bay, jeopardizing the state's cleanup goals for the estuary. The Hogan administration is working to address this issue through conditions related to the dam's relicensing, a pilot project on beneficial reuse of dredged material, and a multistate plan to tackle upstream discharges and the dam's lost sediment-trapping capacity.",true,"Exelon Corp., the energy company that runs the Conowingo Dam, will invest more than $200 million in environmental projects, according to an agreement announced Tuesday by Maryland Gov.

The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has announced an environmental agreement with Exelon, the operator of the Conowingo Dam. The agreement aims to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials are also concerned about sediment buildup behind the dam's walls, which could be released and harm the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The proposed settlement includes $52 million to implement new requirements for flow control in the Lower Susquehanna River, creating more natural conditions. It also includes $41 million to increase efforts to remove trash and debris that flows down the Susquehanna from upstream states. Additionally, $47 million will be allocated for climate resiliency projects, such as submerged aquatic vegetation, clams, oysters, and the restoration of living shorelines. Another $25 million will be used to restore mussels in the Susquehanna. Exelon's president and CEO, Chris Crane, expressed a commitment to restoring and sustaining the health of the Chesapeake Bay, stating that the agreement strengthens this commitment. However, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) expressed concerns that the settlement does not adequately mitigate the negative water quality impact associated with operating the dam. The CBF believes that a majority of the funding should be spent on upstream practices to reduce sediments and pollution reaching the dam. The agreement settles Exelon's legal challenges to the water quality certification issued last year under the Clean Water Act and avoids years of litigation. Exelon has argued that it is unfair to make the company pay for pollution that the dam does not produce. The proposed settlement also includes $500,000 for a study on management options for dredged material. Scientific reports confirm that the dam has reached full capacity and can no longer effectively prevent pollution from entering the Chesapeake Bay, jeopardizing the state's cleanup goals for the estuary. The Hogan administration is working to address this issue through conditions related to the dam's relicensing, a pilot project on beneficial reuse of dredged material, and a multistate plan to tackle upstream discharges and the dam's lost sediment-trapping capacity.

Context: The article discusses the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that it will not pursue criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The DOJ's decision comes after a review of the case by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), which found that Comey's actions were not motivated by political bias. The OIG report also found that Comey's decision to publicly announce the FBI's investigation into Clinton's emails was not appropriate, but it did not recommend criminal charges. The DOJ's decision not to pursue charges against Comey has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the decision as a vindication of Comey's actions, while others have criticized it as a politically motivated move to protect a former FBI director who has been a vocal critic of President Trump. The decision also comes amid ongoing investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and the president's efforts to obstruct justice. The DOJ's decision not to pursue charges against Comey is a significant development in the ongoing saga surrounding the Clinton email investigation and the Trump administration's relationship with the FBI.

48,48,9720,Talk Therapy Found to Ease Schizophrenia,"The article discusses a study that found that a combination of talk therapy and medication can be more effective in treating schizophrenia than just medication alone. The study, which was the most rigorous trial of this treatment in the United States, showed that patients who received more one-on-one talk therapy and family counseling made greater strides in recovery over the first two years of treatment compared to patients who received the usual drug-focused care. The drug doses in the therapy group were also 20-50% lower, which is significant considering the side effects of these drugs. The article mentions that the true costs and potential savings of this comprehensive treatment are hard to quantify and would accrue over time as people stay in school and jobs and have fewer hospital admissions. It also highlights that the study's findings have already influenced government agencies, with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services publishing a strong endorsement of the combined-therapy approach in its guidelines. While the article praises the exploration of the political and reimbursement context, it criticizes the lack of specific numbers in the story. It mentions that the study reported that 34% of the therapy group and 37% of the control group had been hospitalized for psychiatric indications over the two years, but it wishes the story had pressed the study authors for more information on this. However, no harms were documented in the study, and on average, the lower doses of medication showed better symptom relief. The article also mentions that mental health reform bills in Congress mention the study by name and that 32 states have begun using block grants to fund combined-treatment services. It notes that while the study followed patients for two years, longer studies would help solidify the results. Overall, the article rates the story as satisfactory, as it provides a sufficient description of the evidence and does not engage in disease mongering. It also includes quotes from experts who were not authors on the study and explains the two alternatives being compared in the research. The article concludes by stating that the story shows original reporting and does not rely on a news release.",true,"Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. “Though it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,” the correction notes.”Therefore, the study did not conclude ‘that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.’ (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes. )” We changed the headline of our review from “Times captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment” to “Times explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.” The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers. In a large randomized controlled trial in 34 community clinics across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better. The story overall does a solid job of covering the study and its implications. But we wish it had pushed a bit harder to quantify the benefits shown in the 2-year trial with some hard numbers. We applaud the discussion of federal policy and financing, but also wish there had been some discussion of the costs of therapy itself. The inclusion of a variety of perspectives on the research brings depth and nuance to the coverage. Psychiatric treatment in the U.S. has become very drug focused. Other countries are ahead of us on using more integrated care models like the one described in this story, so it’s great to see its success “proven” with a randomized trial. With solid evidence to back it, this model will hopefully become a more accepted approach to practice in the U.S.","The article discusses a study that found that a combination of talk therapy and medication can be more effective in treating schizophrenia than just medication alone.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect.

Each day, over 3,200 youths under the age of 18 try their first cigarette. The report calls for businesses, state and local governments, and society as a whole to take action to end smoking within a generation. The report details the various diseases and health conditions caused by smoking, including liver and colorectal cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired immune function, and cleft palate in infants. It also highlights that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent. The report estimates that smoking costs the nation $130 billion in direct medical expenses each year. The tobacco industry is criticized for its continued efforts to promote their products, with the report noting that the industry spends $8 billion each year on advertising and marketing. The report calls for public health officials to take tougher action to curb tobacco use. It also urges states to increase their investment in smoking prevention, as currently, they only spend about $1.50 per person on tobacco control, despite receiving $80 per capita from tobacco companies related to a major legal settlement in 1998.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: A new report by the Surgeon General has found that smoking has killed over 20 million Americans prematurely in the last 50 years. Although adult smoking rates have decreased, with only 18% of Americans currently smoking compared to 43% in 1965, the report highlights that more needs to be done to eliminate smoking. Each day, over 3,200 youths under the age of 18 try their first cigarette. The report calls for businesses, state and local governments, and society as a whole to take action to end smoking within a generation. The report details the various diseases and health conditions caused by smoking, including liver and colorectal cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired immune function, and cleft palate in infants. It also highlights that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent. The report estimates that smoking costs the nation $130 billion in direct medical expenses each year. The tobacco industry is criticized for its continued efforts to promote their products, with the report noting that the industry spends $8 billion each year on advertising and marketing. The report calls for public health officials to take tougher action to curb tobacco use. It also urges states to increase their investment in smoking prevention, as currently, they only spend about $1.50 per person on tobacco control, despite receiving $80 per capita from tobacco companies related to a major legal settlement in 1998. The report briefly touches on the topic of electronic cigarettes, expressing concerns about their use as smoking cessation tools and their potential to introduce more people to nicotine. Health groups and state attorneys general have been pressuring the FDA to impose regulations on e-cigarettes. The report concludes by calling for renewed political commitment to ending the tobacco epidemic and for cutting smoking rates to less than 10% of the population in a decade.

Context: The article discusses the findings of a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, which found that the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) among young people has increased significantly in recent years. The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from the 2011-2012 and 2013-2014 National Youth Tobacco Surveys. The researchers found that the use of e-cigarettes among high school students increased from 1.5% in 2011-2012 to 16% in 2013-2014. The use of e-cigarettes among middle school students also increased, from 0.6% in 2011-2012 to 4.5% in 2013-2014. The study also found that the use of e-cigarettes among young people was associated with an increased risk of using other tobacco products, such as cigarettes and cigars. The researchers noted that the use of e-cigarettes among young people is a growing public health concern, as e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is addictive","Smoking kills 20 million Americans in 50 years: report"" "

52,52,2564,U.S. teen smoking declines to record low in 2012: study.,"According to an annual survey of about 45,000 students in the eighth, 10th, and 12th grades, the proportion of students who reported smoking in the prior 30 days fell by just over a percentage point to 10.6 percent. This represents a 9 percent reduction in the number of teens currently smoking in a single year. The researchers believe that this decline can lead to the prevention of thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of cases of cancer and other serious diseases. The survey also found that smoking rates fell for each of the individual age groups surveyed, with the most significant decline among eighth graders. The proportion of eighth graders who had tried cigarettes dropped from nearly half in 1996 to just 16 percent in 2012. Teen attitudes toward smoking also became more negative, with 80 percent of teens saying they preferred to date nonsmokers in 2012. The researchers attribute the decline in teen smoking rates to higher cigarette taxes, federal curbs on youth-oriented tobacco marketing and sales, and a sweeping anti-smoking media campaign. The increase in federal cigarette taxes, raised by 62 cents a pack in 2009, is seen as a likely contributing factor. However, the battle to stamp out teen smoking is far from over, as 17 percent of high school seniors still graduate as smokers. The researchers also expressed concerns over new forms of smokeless tobacco, such as dissolvable products like Camel-branded “Orbs” and “Strips,” as well as small cigars and water pipes called hookahs, which are becoming popular among young adults. The tobacco industry still spends $8.5 billion a year to market its products, and anti-tobacco advocates believe that more needs to be done to prevent youth from being enticed by these deadly and addictive products.",true,"Cigarette smoking among American teenagers dropped to a record low in 2012, a decline that may have been partly driven by a sharp hike in the federal tobacco tax, researchers said on Wednesday.","According to an annual survey of about 45,000 students in the eighth, 10th, and 12th grades, the proportion of students who reported smoking in the prior 30 days fell by just over a percentage point to 10.6 percent.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: State legislatures in New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Minnesota, and Iowa are considering bills that would only allow exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons as determined by a child's doctor. The United States has seen at least 704 measles cases this year, which Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has called ""completely avoidable."" The outbreaks have been largely attributed to the spread of misinformation, including the debunked belief that vaccines can cause autism. This misinformation has led to lower vaccination rates in some communities. Maine's Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has already passed a bill that would limit vaccine exemptions, and the Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to vote on it soon. The bill has faced opposition from some Republicans who argue that it infringes on personal beliefs. The governor of Maine, Janet Mills, has not indicated whether she would sign the bill into law. Other states are also considering measures to increase vaccination rates. Washington is set to pass a bill that would remove personal exemptions for the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine while keeping religious exemptions in place. Maine currently has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with 5 percent of kindergartners holding non-medical exemptions. The World Health Organization recommends that at least 95 percent of a community be immunized against measles to achieve herd immunity. Maine has not had any measles cases since 2017, but officials are concerned about outbreaks of whooping cough, another preventable childhood disease. Currently, all 50 states require children to be vaccinated for various diseases to attend public schools, unless they have medical reasons for exemption. Only three states, Mississippi, West Virginia, and California, prohibit all non-medical exemptions. Maine is one of 17 states that allow parents to opt out based on personal or moral beliefs. California banned non-medical exemptions in 2015 after a measles outbreak linked to Disneyland. The state saw an increase in the proportion of kindergarten students receiving all mandated vaccines, but also an increase in claimed medical exemptions. Lawmakers are now considering new legislation to give the state final say over the validity of medical exemptions due to concerns about doctors issuing spurious exemptions.

In 1976, there was a swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in New Jersey, which resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier. President Gerald Ford initiated a massive immunization effort that resulted in some 45 million Americans getting a swine flu vaccine. Among those who got the vaccine, more than 500 people developed Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rare neurological illness that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis. Two dozen people died from it. A medical panel concluded that there was a causal relationship between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barre in adults. However, in the nearly 30 years since then, there has been no proof that the seasonal flu vaccines caused any more cases of Guillain-Barre or any other neurological diseases. Doctors say that the track record of seasonal flu vaccines shows that the H1N1 vaccine is safe. Studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have shown that the only side effects of the H1N1 vaccine so far are sore arms and stuffed-up noses. However, there haven't been enough trials to definitively rule out the possibility of neurological problems.

55,55,25853,“Florida is doing over five times better” than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people.,"The claim that Florida is doing over five times better than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people is misleading. While it is true that Florida's death rate is lower than that of New Jersey and New York, there are important factors to consider. According to an epidemiologist, the metric of COVID-19 deaths per million people is time-sensitive and difficult to interpret without proper context. The true denominator, which is the number of people infected, is unknown, and it is impossible to predict the future course of the outbreak. The Facebook post that made the claim cited data from Worldometer, which showed that Florida's death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey's and New York's. Other databases, including one from Johns Hopkins University, also confirmed this finding. However, this measure is limited because it only focuses on a state that became a hotspot after New York and New Jersey. News reports before the Facebook post highlighted Florida's record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases. The state had the highest single-day total of new cases and the highest weekly death total during the outbreak. A federal report also classified Florida as one of the 21 states in the ""red zone"" due to serious outbreaks. To provide a larger perspective, among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people. This statistic, according to Johns Hopkins University, places the US behind the United Kingdom, Peru, and Chile. Timing is a crucial factor in understanding the misleading nature of the claim. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, while Florida experienced its surge later. Experts argue that it is necessary to wait until the outbreak is over to accurately assess how well states have handled the situation. As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared to 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York. However, death counts and rates are lagging indicators and cannot predict the future course of the outbreak. In conclusion, while Florida does have a lower death rate than New Jersey and New York, it is misleading to claim that it is doing over five times better.

The United States has the highest death toll from COVID-19 in the world, with over 600,000 deaths as of March 2022. The country's high death rate is attributed to several factors, including a lack of a national strategy to combat the virus, a fragmented healthcare system, and a politicized response to the pandemic. The United States also has a higher proportion of older people, who are more vulnerable to the virus, compared to other countries. The United States' high death rate is a cause for concern and highlights the need for a more effective response to the pandemic.

56,56,14726,"Hillary Clinton Says Bernie Sanders ""has reversed his position on immunity"" for gun manufacturers and sellers.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of flip-flopping on his position regarding immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers. Clinton has been criticizing Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided significant protection against lawsuits for gun makers, sellers, and trade associations. Sanders, who represents a rural state where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights and sometimes with supporters of gun control. One of the examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill in 2005. Clinton called on Sanders to admit that he got it wrong in a recent interview. Sanders responded by releasing a statement saying that he supports proposals to rescind portions of the 2005 law and tighten it up. Clinton portrayed this as a flip-flop during a debate, but Sanders' campaign manager disagreed, saying that it was consistent with Sanders' previous position. The bill in question includes provisions for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also has exceptions for cases involving violent crimes, negligence, and physical defects with the weapon. Sanders and his campaign have expressed comfort with his past vote on the bill, but he has also said that he would be open to reconsidering it. In a recent news release, Sanders expressed support for a proposal to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law, while keeping the trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions intact. He also stated that he would propose an amendment to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law's impact in rural areas. Clinton's claim that Sanders has reversed his position on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers is accurate, as Sanders' position has evolved over time. While he initially defended his vote on the 2005 bill, he has since expressed openness to reconsidering it and has supported proposals to rescind the immunity provisions.",true,"So is Clinton right that Sanders flip-flopped on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers? Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers. After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders’ position started to evolve in October. Sanders’ position three months ago -- that he would ""take another look"" at the liability question -- is consistent with his Jan. 16 news release saying he supported a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. But to look back only to October doesn’t tell the full story, ignoring not only the 2003 and 2005 votes but also several instances in which Sanders or his staff defended those votes in interviews between June 2015 and early January 2016. That sounds like a flip-flop to us.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of flip-flopping on his position regarding immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers. Clinton has been criticizing Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided significant protection against lawsuits for gun makers, sellers, and trade associations. Sanders, who represents a rural state where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights and sometimes with supporters of gun control. One of the examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill in 2005. Clinton called on Sanders to admit that he got it wrong in a recent interview. Sanders responded by releasing a statement saying that he supports proposals to rescind portions of the 2005 law and tighten it up. Clinton portrayed this as a flip-flop during a debate, but Sanders' campaign manager disagreed, saying that it was consistent with Sanders' previous position. The bill in question includes provisions for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also has exceptions for cases involving violent crimes, negligence, and physical defects with the weapon. Sanders and his campaign have expressed comfort with his past vote on the bill, but he has also said that he would be open to reconsidering it. In a recent news release, Sanders expressed support for a proposal to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law, while keeping the trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions intact. He also stated that he would propose an amendment to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law's impact in rural areas. Clinton's claim that Sanders has reversed his position on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers is accurate, as Sanders' position has evolved over time. While he initially defended his vote on the 2005 bill, he has since expressed openness to reconsidering it and has supported proposals to rescind the immunity provisions.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: A new study has found that the coronavirus can survive on surfaces for up to nine days. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the virus can remain infectious on plastic and stainless steel for up to nine days, and on cardboard for up to 24 hours. The study also found that the virus can remain infectious in the air for up to three hours. The study was conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The researchers tested the virus on a variety of surfaces, including plastic, stainless steel, cardboard, and copper. They found that the virus was most stable on plastic and stainless steel, and least stable on copper. The study also found that the virus was more stable at lower temperatures and higher humidity. The study's findings have important implications for how the virus is transmitted. The study's authors say that the findings suggest that the virus can be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, as well as through the air. The study's findings also suggest that the virus can remain infectious for a long time, which could make it difficult to contain.

The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article is about an anti-terrorism presentation given by Lt. Col. John G. Cotter of the California Air National Guard to the Rotary Club in Clovis, California. The presentation was about the EagleEyes program, which aims to teach military personnel and civilians to recognize elements of potential terror planning. The program encourages people to call the FBI, Fresno Police, or Air Force OSI if they see something suspicious. The claim mentioned in the prompt is that the presentation warned about women in burqas buying up cell phones. However, Lt. Col. Cotter denies making such remarks and states that the quotes attributed to him are false. He clarifies that he never refers to people using derogatory terms and emphasizes that the program does not involve profiling. The Fresno Bee also reported that other attendees of the presentation did not recall Lt. Col. Cotter making the remarks mentioned in the claim. Rotary member Bill Mayhugh, who is responsible for arranging speakers for the club, supports Lt. Col. Cotter's version of the presentation. Mayhugh states that the presentation focused on community outreach and encouraged people to report suspicious activities to the police, FBI, or Homeland Security. In summary, the article refutes the claim that the anti-terrorism presentation warned about women in burqas buying up cell phones. Lt. Col. Cotter denies making such remarks and states that the quotes attributed to him are false. Other attendees of the presentation also do not recall him making those remarks. The purpose of the presentation was to educate people about recognizing potential terror planning and encouraging them to report suspicious activities to the appropriate authorities.

60,60,377,Quebec appeals court upholds C$15 billion tobacco class action ruling.,"The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld a C$15 billion ($11.3 billion) judgment against three major tobacco companies in Canada. The judgment involves class action suits that were consolidated against the Canadian subsidiaries of British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, and Japan Tobacco International. The companies were appealing a 2015 Quebec Superior Court ruling that awarded damages to around 100,000 Quebec smokers and ex-smokers who claimed that the companies knew since the 1950s that their products were causing cancer and other illnesses but failed to adequately warn consumers. The judgment is considered a ""huge defeat"" for the tobacco industry, according to Rob Cunningham from the Canadian Cancer Society. The companies are expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The judgment comes at a time when tobacco companies are investing heavily in vaping devices that they claim are less harmful than traditional smoking. The two Quebec suits, known as the Letourneau and Blais cases, were filed in 1998 and certified as class actions in 2005. The cases were consolidated into one before the trial proceedings began in 2012 and concluded in 2014. The companies involved in the case expressed disappointment with the decision and stated that they fundamentally disagree with the court's judgment.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The article states that Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is seeking a personal presidential pardon from Donald Trump as recompense for his role in sabotaging Hillary Clinton during the 2016 elections. Assange has been avoiding prosecution in the United States since 2011 for leaking classified documents through WikiLeaks. Despite previously likening Trump to cholera, Assange is now appealing to Trump for a pardon. The article also mentions that WikiLeaks has been negotiating with American authorities for several years regarding their operations. It includes a statement from Assange in 2012, where he implored President Obama to renounce the investigation against WikiLeaks and pledge not to prosecute their staff or supporters. The article also highlights that Assange currently resides at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and is wanted by Swedish authorities over allegations of sexual assault, so a pardon from the US president would not necessarily resolve his legal troubles. The article also discusses the legality of WikiLeaks' actions. It mentions that in 2010, Legal As She Is Spoke argued that WikiLeaks had committed no crime for publishing leaked documents pertaining to the US conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It explains that generally publishing classified information is not a crime in the United States, except for specific cases such as nuclear secrets, identities of covert agents, and certain forms of communications intelligence. The article clarifies that the most commonly cited statute by those advocating for prosecuting WikiLeaks does not apply to those who publish information. It states that the word ""communicates"" in the relevant section of the Espionage Act was never meant to encompass publication or affect the press. The article also includes an editorial from Slate in 2010 that praised WikiLeaks for holding the United States accountable and puncturing the prerogative of secrecy. The article concludes by mentioning that WikiLeaks' Task Force confirmed that the organization had asked the Obama administration to cease investigating their activities and to pardon whistleblowers. They emphasized that WikiLeaks publishes without favor and would never release or withhold information based on the possibility of favorable treatment from any state or entity.

Context: The article discusses the recent announcement by the United States Department of Justice that it will not pursue charges against Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while serving as Secretary of State. The article notes that the decision was made after a review of the evidence and a determination that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. The article also highlights the fact that the decision was made by career prosecutors and not by Attorney General William Barr, who has been criticized for his handling of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The article also notes that the decision not to pursue charges against Clinton is not a reflection on her character or her actions, but rather a recognition that the evidence does not support a criminal case. The article also discusses the political implications of the decision, noting that it could be seen as a victory for Clinton and her supporters, who have long argued that the investigation into her email server was politically motivated. The article also notes that the decision could be seen as a blow to President Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Clinton and her use of a private email server.

The article provides a chain email that circulated on social media, claiming that Michelle Obama voluntarily surrendered her law license in 1993 and Barack Obama surrendered his in 2008 to avoid charges of lying on his bar application. However, these claims are debunked. A search of the state of Illinois' Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission website shows that Barack Obama's law license was changed to ""retired"" in 2008 when he was elected president.

After Marie Curie discovered radium in 1898, Parisians became obsessed with the luminescent metal and started using it in various products. However, the companies that manufactured these products have since gone out of business, leaving small doses of radium between the cracks of some Parisian parquet floors. While prolonged exposure to these small doses of radium could be toxic, officials claim that they do not pose serious health risks. France's national agency for radioactive waste, ANDRA, has identified around 130 sites in France suspected of being at risk, with 40 of them set for decontamination, half of which are in the Paris area. The clean-up efforts are being undertaken as a precautionary measure under a recent French law. The article highlights a two-storey house in Chaville, a suburb of Paris, where masked men in hazmat suits are drilling holes in the wooden floors. This house used to be an aircraft altimeter factory, and the workers used radium powder and zinc sulphide to color the dials with glow-in-the-dark paint. Traces of the paint are still present in the wooden floor, garden, and basement, but they are too small to present a risk. However, they still need to be collected and sent to ANDRA's nuclear waste storage sites. The decontamination cost for a house like this is 260,000 euros, and ANDRA has a 4 million euro annual budget for decontamination. Some sites that are deemed too contaminated to make renovation cost-effective have been bought by ANDRA and razed.

65,65,13691,"Bill Clinton Says Hillary Clinton tripled the number of people with AIDS whose ""lives are being saved .. and it did not cost you any more money.","Bill Clinton claimed in his Democratic convention speech that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she tripled the number of people with AIDS whose lives were being saved, and it did not cost taxpayers any more money. While Clinton's statement is not perfectly accurate, it is close. The claim refers to the achievements of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a State Department program that aims to get as many people as possible into HIV/AIDS treatment, primarily in Africa. PEPFAR started under President George W. Bush, and President Barack Obama continued it. Hillary Clinton can take some credit for PEPFAR's achievements as it is a State Department program. The number of people in treatment rose from 2.1 million at the end of 2008 to 5.1 million by the end of 2012, more than doubling but not quite tripling as Clinton stated. However, this increase did come without additional tax dollars. Treatment spending fell dramatically for two years and then returned to the 2009 level, delivering about 250 percent more treatment with the same amount of money. The cost per patient was also significantly reduced during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, from $673 to $338. This was achieved through the shift to generic drugs and cost-cutting measures such as using land and sea transportation instead of air delivery. While not all of the work is done by State Department agencies, the secretary of state sets the priorities, and in this case, the priority was to expand treatment at a lower cost per person. AIDS activists considered Hillary Clinton an ally, and she had a clear understanding of what was needed. She also played a role in switching from expensive international NGOs to working with in-country partners and ministries of health. In conclusion, while Bill Clinton's statement is not entirely accurate, it is close. Treatment for HIV/AIDS did increase significantly during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, and it did not require additional tax dollars. She played a role in setting the overall direction of the program and intervened in specific ways to expand treatment at a lower cost.",true,"Bill Clinton said when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she tripled the number of people with AIDS whose ""lives are being saved,"" and it didn’t cost taxpayers any more money. Clinton took some liberties with the numbers. Treatment rose rapidly by about 250 percent. That’s not quite triple. But Clinton was right that those gains came without additional spending in inflation-adjusted dollars. And while Hillary Clinton can’t take full credit, outsiders said she did set the overall direction for how the program should move forward and intervened in specific ways to help it do more at a lower cost.","Bill Clinton claimed in his Democratic convention speech that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she tripled the number of people with AIDS whose lives were being saved, and it did not cost taxpayers any more money.

PEPFAR started under President George W. Bush, and President Barack Obama continued it. Hillary Clinton can take some credit for PEPFAR's achievements as it is a State Department program.

The number of people in treatment rose from 2.1 million at the end of 2008 to 5.1 million by the end of 2012, more than doubling but not quite tripling as Clinton stated. However, this increase did come without additional tax dollars. Treatment spending fell dramatically for two years and then returned to the 2009 level, delivering about 250 percent more treatment with the same amount of money.

The cost per patient was also significantly reduced during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, from $673 to $338. This was achieved through the shift to generic drugs and cost-cutting measures such as using land and sea transportation instead of air delivery.

While not all of the work is done by State Department agencies, the secretary of state sets the priorities, and in this case, the priority was to expand treatment at a lower cost per person. AIDS activists considered Hillary Clinton an ally, and she had a clear understanding of what was needed. She also played a role in switching from expensive international NGOs to working with in-country partners and ministries of health.

In conclusion, while Bill Clinton's statement is not entirely accurate, it is close. Treatment for HIV/AIDS did increase significantly during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, and it did not require additional tax dollars. She played a role in setting the overall direction of the program and intervened in specific ways to expand treatment at a lower cost.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

The ban was first implemented in January 2017 and has been challenged in court multiple times. The Supreme Court's decision was a 5-4 vote, with the conservative justices in the majority. The court ruled that the ban was within the president's authority to restrict immigration and that it did not violate the Constitution's prohibition on religious discrimination. The court also rejected arguments that the ban was motivated by anti-Muslim bias. The decision was met with criticism from civil rights groups and Democrats, who argued that the ban was discriminatory and unconstitutional. The court's decision was also seen as a victory for President Trump, who had made the ban a key campaign promise. The ban applies to citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and Chad, as well as North Korea and Venezuela. The court's decision is expected to have a significant impact on immigration policy and could set a precedent for future executive actions by the president.

68,68,2409,New York City Council votes to add e-cigarettes to smoking ban.,"The New York City Council has voted to add electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, to the city's Smoke-Free Air Act. If the mayor signs the bill, smoking e-cigarettes, also known as ""vaping,"" would be prohibited in public and private venues such as beaches, parks, restaurants, and office buildings. The bill was sponsored by City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who believes that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine anti-smoking laws. E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in various flavors. When a user puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that does not contain tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law argue that the ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a board member at NJOY, one of America's largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council urging them to reject the bill. Carmona expressed concern that including e-cigarettes in the smoking ban could be a setback in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking. The debate over the risks versus benefits of e-cigarettes is ongoing, but a recent study published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, found that they are as effective as nicotine patches for smokers trying to quit. Three states - Utah, North Dakota, and New Jersey - have already passed legislation banning e-cigarettes wherever smoking is prohibited.",true,"The New York City Council voted to add electronic cigarettes to the city’s strict smoking ban on Thursday, in what could be the latest of many anti-tobacco measures put in place by outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg.","The New York City Council has voted to add electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, to the city's Smoke-Free Air Act.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: The New York City Council has voted to add electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, to the city's Smoke-Free Air Act. If the mayor signs the bill, smoking e-cigarettes, also known as ""vaping,"" would be prohibited in public and private venues such as beaches, parks, restaurants, and office buildings. The bill was sponsored by City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who believes that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine anti-smoking laws. E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in various flavors. When a user puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that does not contain tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law argue that the ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a board member at NJOY, one of America's largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council urging them to reject the bill.

Context: The article discusses the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The court ruled that the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, is constitutional. The court also ruled that the rest of the law, including the expansion of Medicaid, can stand. The article examines the implications of the decision and how it will affect Americans. The individual mandate was a key part of the law, as it was designed to ensure that everyone has health insurance, which would help to reduce costs and improve the quality of care. The court's decision to uphold the mandate means that the law will remain in place, and Americans will have to comply with the requirement to have health insurance or pay a penalty. The court's decision to uphold the rest of the law, including the expansion of Medicaid, means that more Americans will have access to health insurance. The article also discusses the political implications of the decision. Republicans have been critical of the law and have tried to repeal it, but the court's decision means that the law will remain in place. Democrats have praised the decision, as it means that the law will continue to provide health insurance to millions of Americans","New York City Council votes to add e-cigarettes to smoking ban"" "

The study, published in the Archives of Dermatology, surveyed 326 African American women and examined their scalps. It found that nearly all of the women straightened their curls chemically and about one in six had scarring hair loss. More than half of the women with scarring hair loss reported having braids, weaves, or hair extensions, compared to only a third of those with less severe hair loss. However, the study could not definitively prove that hair grooming was the cause of the hair loss. The researchers also discovered that women with type 2 diabetes were more likely to have scarring hair loss, as were those with bacterial scalp infections. This suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the balding. The lead researcher, Angela Kyei, emphasized that hair grooming should not be the only factor considered when examining patients with hair loss. The study's findings highlight the potential link between prolonged pulling at hair strands and inflammation of the hair follicle, which can lead to scarring. This scarring can result in scarring hair loss or central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, a type of balding that starts at the top of the scalp and spreads slowly to the rest. While the study focused on African American women, the findings may have implications for hair loss in other populations as well. The researchers suggest that women, regardless of their ethnicity, should be aware of the potential risks associated with certain hair grooming practices. In conclusion, the study found a high prevalence of central hair loss among African American women, with a significant number of them reporting the use of braids, weaves, or hair extensions.

70,70,7306,Troubled Texas anti-abortion group seeks federal grant money.,"The Round Rock-based Heidi Group, along with two other Texas health providers, has applied for grant funding under the federal Department of Health and Human Services' Title X program. The program provides family-planning services to low-income individuals for free or at low cost. The collaborative funding application proposes that the grant money be managed by the Obria Group, a Catholic organization that aims to become an alternative to Planned Parenthood. The group has requested nearly $8 million annually for three years, with medical duties split among the three health providers to serve about 15,000 patients each year. Obria has previously been denied Title X funding due to its opposition to the use of condoms and other forms of birth control. If approved, the Obria Group could expand significantly in Texas, which has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the country. There are approximately 1.8 million women in Texas in need of publicly-funded family planning services. This funding would also help the Heidi Group recover after being cut off by Texas health officials last year. The Heidi Group was hired in 2016 to strengthen small clinics that provide women's health services but do not offer abortions. However, an investigation by The Associated Press in 2017 revealed that the group did not come close to serving the promised 50,000 women. As a result, Texas cancelled $6 million in contracts and is investigating over $1 million in billings. The Heidi Group's founder, Carol Everett, stated in a letter submitted with the grant application that their involvement would significantly improve the availability and access to these services. Texas currently receives about $13 million annually from the Title X program, which is facing a lawsuit from two groups seeking to block a new rule that would prohibit family planning clinics funded by Title X from making abortion referrals. Obria is competing for funding with the Women's Health and Family Planning Association of Texas, which served 195,000 patients last year.

Context: The article discusses the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold a lower court ruling that struck down a Texas law that required abortion clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers. The law, known as HB2, also required doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Supreme Court's decision was a victory for abortion rights advocates, who argued that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The court's ruling was a 5-3 decision, with the majority opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is often considered a swing vote on abortion-related cases, joined the majority. The decision was a major setback for anti-abortion groups, who had hoped to use the law to limit access to abortions in Texas. The law had already led to the closure of more than half of the state's abortion clinics, leaving women in many parts of the state with limited options for obtaining an abortion. The Supreme Court's decision was seen as a significant victory for abortion rights advocates, who have been fighting to protect access to abortion for decades.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

73,73,10562,The trouble with mammograms,"The article titled ""The trouble with mammograms"" discusses the potential drawbacks and limitations of mammography as a screening tool for breast cancer. It highlights the fact that mass screening can lead to overtreatment and unnecessary treatment for some women. The article also mentions the significant cost implications of these treatments, which amount to around $10 billion annually for screening and another $10 billion annually for treatment. The article emphasizes the importance of presenting key numbers such as the number needed to test (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH). These numbers help to understand how many women need to be screened regularly to save one life and how many women may receive unnecessary treatments. The article also mentions that 22% of cancers might regress on their own, which is an important consideration for women when deciding on their personal mammography screening schedule or whether to screen for breast cancer at all. The discomfort and potential harms of mammography are discussed, including finding benign lesions and overtreatment for less aggressive cancers. However, the article does not mention the anxiety many women face before and after screening, especially if a mammogram is positive. It also highlights the high false positive rate of mammography, which is about 50% over 10 years. The article praises the design of the BMJ study and evidence from a recent Cochrane review of breast cancer screening. It presents this new information in the context of similar analyses that have found screening to be overvalued for saving lives. The article does not engage in disease mongering but instead discusses lower-risk forms of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions that may not require treatment. The article includes perspectives from expert epidemiologists, clinicians, breast cancer survivors, and advocates. It questions the value of screening for some women and presents a balanced view by citing both a pro-screening advocate and a clinician who gives a tempered response to the latest data. The article also raises the option that some women may choose not to have regular mammograms, which is not often discussed in news stories. While the article does not rely on a press release for information, it provides interpretation of medical studies and independent reporting from various clinical experts and breast cancer advocacy groups. However, it could have further discussed the role of patients in decision-making and the importance of shared decision-making between patients and caregivers.

The story nicely presents this seemingly counter-intuitive point that finding more cancer may not save lives; however, the story could have discussed the role patients can play in deciding whether or not to get screened and how they could discuss this decision with physicians, who may be strong advocates for screening. The story does not mention that women could discuss an individualized screening schedule with their physician. Some women at higher-risk of breast cancer may be better candidates for annual screening between age 40-50 (or earlier, depending on family history or genetic markers), while others may not wish to screen until they are in their 50s or 60s. The story does not mention how physicians could counsel anxious patients on the true value of screening for breast cancer. The story does note that mass screening results in overtreatment and possibly unnecessary treatment for some women; however, the cost implications for such treatments are not discussed, an important omission at this time in the development of U.S. healthcare policy and physician reimbursements for screening. The story superbly cites expert epidemiologists and clinicians who discuss the problems with overselling mammograms and how this flies in the face of public health campaigns and U.S. clinical guidelines that women over 40 get annual mammograms. The story also cites a breast cancer survivor and advocate who questions the value of screening for some women. An advocate from a pro-screening group is also cited and her message is balanced by a clinician (who consults with the organization) who gives a tempered response to the latest data that screening may not benefit, and may even harm, women who are not at high-risk of developing aggressive breast cancer.","The article titled ""The trouble with mammograms"" discusses the potential drawbacks and limitations of mammography as a screening tool for breast cancer.

74,74,7029,2020 hopeful Moulton shares mental health woes as war vet.,"Massachusetts congressman and 2020 presidential candidate Seth Moulton opened up about his mental health struggles as a war veteran during a town hall in Lynn. Moulton, who served in the Iraq War, revealed that he started seeing a therapist after returning home. He shared a haunting memory of driving past an injured Iraqi boy lying in the middle of the road without stopping to help him, explaining that stopping would have endangered the lives of his platoon. This image haunted him every day, both during his time in Iraq and after returning home. Moulton emphasized the importance of therapy in his healing process, stating that he cannot put into words how much it has helped him.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: Italy has ordered the closure of all businesses, except those essential to maintaining the country's supply chain, in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte described the situation as the most difficult crisis since World War II. Supermarkets, pharmacies, postal and banking services will remain open, and essential public services including transport will be ensured.

Context: The article discusses the recent announcement by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) that it will not defend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in a lawsuit brought by 20 Republican-led states. The lawsuit argues that the ACA is unconstitutional because the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, is no longer in effect. The DOJ's decision not to defend the ACA has raised concerns about the future of the law and the millions of Americans who rely on it for health coverage. The article notes that the DOJ's decision is not surprising given the Trump administration's previous efforts to undermine the ACA, such as cutting funding for outreach and enrollment efforts and reducing the length of the open enrollment period. The article also points out that the DOJ's decision is not legally binding and that the ACA could still be defended by other parties, such as the Democratic-led states that are intervening in the lawsuit. The article concludes by highlighting the potential consequences of the ACA's demise, including the loss of health coverage for millions of Americans and the destabilization of the individual insurance market.

81,81,6417,Michael Bloomberg named World Health Organization ambassador.,"Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been appointed as the Global Ambassador for Non-communicable Diseases by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO Director General Margaret Chan praised Bloomberg for his support in controlling smoking and tobacco use, improving road safety, and preventing drowning. Bloomberg's role as ambassador will involve mobilizing political leaders, donors, and the private sector to prevent and treat non-communicable diseases, which are responsible for 43 million deaths each year. Non-communicable diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart and lung disease, account for almost 80 percent of all deaths worldwide and are the leading cause of premature death in developing countries. However, they currently receive only 2 percent of all health funding. Road traffic crashes, which cause 1.25 million deaths each year, are the leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29. Bloomberg's appointment is expected to strengthen WHO's response to these major public health challenges. Effective strategies to prevent non-communicable diseases include increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol, enforcing smoke-free environments, promoting healthy diets, and discouraging the consumption of sugary, salty, and fatty foods. Proven actions to prevent injuries include wearing seat belts and helmets, enforcing speed limits, implementing drink-driving legislation, and enforcing laws on smoke alarms and hot water temperatures. Bloomberg has a history of taking steps to improve public health, such as raising cigarette prices, banning trans fats, and attempting to limit the size of sodas during his tenure as mayor of New York City. His philanthropic investments in public health include commitments to eradicate polio, reduce global tobacco use, and tackle obesity, road safety, maternal health, and drowning.

MERS, which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, is from the same family as the SARS virus and can cause coughing, fever, and pneumonia. The high death rate of over 40% among confirmed cases and the spread of the virus beyond the Middle East has raised concerns among scientists and public health officials. The new cases include one fatal case in a 73-year-old Saudi man and three cases in Saudi health workers who showed no adverse symptoms. In the UAE, a 59-year-old woman, the wife of a previously infected man, has been confirmed as a new case. Although she has no adverse symptoms, she is currently in isolation in the hospital.

83,83,30150,Clinton associate Vince Foster shot himself three times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton.,"The claim that Vince Foster, a Clinton associate, shot himself three times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton is false. Foster's death was ruled a suicide by multiple investigations. The conspiracy theory surrounding Foster's death persists due to a partisan fan base and was even lent credence by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. The theory resurfaced in September 2018 in the form of a meme shared on Facebook, which falsely claimed that Foster shot himself in September when he actually died in July. The timing of the meme's re-sharing coincided with the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who had led the investigation into Foster's death. Kavanaugh's involvement in the investigation has given rise to a new addendum to the conspiracy theory, suggesting that he helped cover up wrongdoing by exonerating the Clintons. However, every investigation into Foster's death has found that he shot himself once in the mouth with his own handgun. Foster's suicide was attributed to his distress over accusations of malfeasance involving the White House Travel Office, and he had sought treatment for depression prior to his death. The claim that Foster's death was connected to an expectation of his giving testimony against the Clintons is also false. Despite the persistence of conspiracy theories, there have been five official investigations into Foster's death, all of which concluded that it was a suicide.",false,"Yes, the bullet was never found. (Foster died in a wooded park.) Yes, the Clinton White House was sometimes slow to release information or took steps that at times raised suspicions, such as removing from Foster’s office files concerning an Arkansas real estate deal.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax.

Context: The claim that Vince Foster, a Clinton associate, shot himself three times in the back of the head to avoid testifying against Hillary Clinton is false. Foster's death was ruled a suicide by multiple investigations. The conspiracy theory surrounding Foster's death persists due to a partisan fan base and was even lent credence by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. The theory resurfaced in September 2018 in the form of a meme shared on Facebook, which falsely claimed that Foster shot himself in September when he actually died in July. The timing of the meme's re-sharing coincided with the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who had led the investigation into Foster's death. Kavanaugh's involvement in the investigation has given rise to a new addendum to the conspiracy theory, suggesting that he helped cover up wrongdoing by exonerating the Clintons. However, every investigation into Foster's death has found that he shot himself once in the mouth with his own handgun.

87,87,8800,Morning-after pill sold over the counter in Canada.,"The National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities in Canada has decided to make the emergency contraceptive pill, Plan B, available directly from pharmacy shelves. Previously, the pill had behind-the-counter status, meaning it was available from a pharmacist upon request but did not require a doctor's prescription.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

90,90,32598,The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016.,"The claim that the DEA will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016 is false. The article explains that rumors began circulating on social media in mid-June 2016, claiming that the DEA would be legalizing marijuana by moving it from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 classification. However, the article states that the source of this information is an anonymous DEA lawyer, which raises doubts about its credibility. The article also highlights that reputable journalists rarely use anonymous sources as the sole source of information. The article goes on to mention that the DEA has previously rejected a rescheduling petition for marijuana in 2011, stating that the known risks of marijuana use have not been outweighed by specific benefits in well-controlled clinical trials. However, the DEA has acknowledged that they intend to respond to a five-year-old rescheduling petition by July 1, 2016. The article also discusses the potential implications of rescheduling marijuana. If marijuana becomes a Schedule 2 drug, it would be subject to intense inspections and testing by the FDA.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS.

The cost of the pill is not mentioned, but similar pills on the market have a retail price of approximately $10 per pill or $300 per month. The study aimed to achieve a target blood pressure below 140/90, and the results showed that 70% of subjects reached this target with the triple pill compared to just over half receiving normal care. However, it is important to note that the study only measured blood pressure after 6 months, and the effect on cardiovascular risk reduction is unknown. The article also mentions the side effects reported in the study, which include dizziness and fainting in the triple pill group. Combination antihypertensive medications can have major drug interactions and cause swelling and metabolic disturbances. The study design included 700 patients randomized to receive either the triple pill or usual care, with an average patient age of 56 years old and a mean baseline blood pressure of 154/90. The difference in systolic blood pressure achieved by the triple pill group compared to the usual care group was only 9 mm of mercury, which may not be clinically significant at the individual level. The study was conducted in Sri Lanka, and the authors noted that the results may not be generalized to Western, industrialized countries. The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, and the two lead authors quoted in the news release receive a salary from George Health Enterprises, which has submitted a patent for the treatment of hypertension. The article points out that combination blood pressure-lowering medications have been around for decades, and there are already once-daily triple pills on the market.

But there’s plenty of room for improvement here including: presenting the findings in a more meaningful context for patients, including the substantial adverse outcomes noted by the researchers, and using much more toned down language for results that are neither novel or all that significant. Notably, there is a significant financial conflict of interest involving the authors. This should have been made clear to readers. The global importance of poorly controlled high blood pressure is well-stated by the authors in the introduction to their study published in JAMA (paraphrased): High blood pressure is the leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease globally with most of the disease burden occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The availability and affordability of medications is a critical issue. About one-third of individuals with high blood pressure in these settings receive treatment. Only about half of patients treated in high-income countries and about 1-in-4 patients in low- and middle-income countries achieve blood pressure control. A fixed low-dose combination therapy with inexpensive blood pressure-lowering drugs has the potential to address several barriers to improve blood pressure control worldwide. Indeed, there’s significant need for a simple-to-take, effective, and affordable medication to address this issue. If successful, the benefits to patients, and the profits for developers, would be massive.","The article discusses a study on a new triple pill that combines three different medications to lower blood pressure.

The law, known as the Reproductive FACT Act, requires these centers to post a notice informing patients of the availability of free or low-cost abortion services. The centers argue that the law violates their First Amendment rights by forcing them to promote a message that conflicts with their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court will hear the case in the fall, and a decision is expected by the end of June 2018. The case has sparked controversy and debate, with pro-life groups arguing that the law violates their freedom of speech and religious liberty, while pro-choice groups argue that the law is necessary to ensure that women have access to accurate information about their reproductive health options. The Supreme Court's decision in the case could have significant implications for the future of abortion rights and reproductive health care in the United States.

93,93,36094,Taco Bell recalled two million pounds of meat due to the possibility of contamination by metal shavings.,"Taco Bell recalled approximately 2.3 million pounds of seasoned beef due to the potential contamination of metal shavings. The recall was initiated after three customers reported finding metal shavings in their food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified the recall as a ""Class I"" health hazard, meaning there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product could cause serious health consequences or death. The beef, produced by Kenosha Beef International, was manufactured in Columbus, Ohio, and distributed to five distribution centers in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia before being delivered to Taco Bell restaurants nationwide. The affected product was produced between September 20 and October 4, 2019, potentially impacting 21 states. Taco Bell took immediate action and voluntarily recalled the beef from its restaurants and distribution centers. By October 14, 2019, all affected restaurants in the 21 states had confirmed that the product had been removed and discarded. The states affected by the recall include CT, DE, IL, IN, KY, MA, MD, ME, MI, NC, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, RI, TN, VA, VT, WV, and Washington, D.C. The FSIS expressed concern that some affected meat may still be in restaurant refrigerators and urged restaurants not to serve the recalled products.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

96,96,8211,"In Nagoya, scramble for hospital beds shows coronavirus challenge for aging Japan.","Japan is facing challenges in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak due to its aging population and limited hospital capacity. While the country has closed schools and canceled public events to prevent the spread of the virus, the lack of widespread testing has led some medical experts to believe that the extent of infection is understated. This raises concerns that a surge in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system. Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, is particularly affected, with 98 confirmed cases and only 27 beds available for coronavirus patients. Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp, is the second-hardest hit prefecture in Japan, with 121 confirmed cases. The prefecture has a total of 161 beds capable of handling such patients, and 105 of them are already in use. The elderly population in Japan is especially vulnerable to the virus, as the country has the world's oldest population, with over 28% aged 65 or over. Experts warn that if the epidemic continues, Japan could face a situation similar to Italy, which is struggling to cope with the increasing number of cases. To address the shortage of hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgeries may be asked to wait, and those with milder symptoms may be asked to isolate at home. Hospitals are also preparing plans to transfer patients to facilities that can treat them. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stated that there are 12,000 beds nationwide that can accommodate serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators. However, experts argue that there may not be enough trained medical staff to handle all of these cases. The shortage of cutting-edge equipment, such as ventilators, also poses a risk and could lead to difficult decisions about prioritizing treatment. In response to the situation, Japan's health ministry has issued guidelines on handling an influx of coronavirus patients. The government has the power to declare a state of emergency, but Prime Minister Abe has stated that the conditions do not warrant such a declaration yet.

Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.

Context: Japan is facing challenges in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak due to its aging population and limited hospital capacity. While the country has closed schools and canceled public events to prevent the spread of the virus, the lack of widespread testing has led some medical experts to believe that the extent of infection is understated. This raises concerns that a surge in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system. Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, is particularly affected, with 98 confirmed cases and only 27 beds available for coronavirus patients. Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp, is the second-hardest hit prefecture in Japan, with 121 confirmed cases. The prefecture has a total of 161 beds capable of handling such patients, and 105 of them are already in use. The elderly population in Japan is especially vulnerable to the virus, as the country has the world's oldest population, with over 28% aged 65 or over. Experts warn that if the epidemic continues, Japan could face a situation similar to Italy, which is struggling to cope with the increasing number of cases. To address the shortage of hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgeries may be asked to wait, and those with milder symptoms may be asked to isolate at home. Hospitals are also preparing plans to transfer patients to facilities that can treat them. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stated that there are 12,000 beds nationwide that can accommodate serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators. However, experts argue that there may not be enough trained medical staff to handle all of these cases. The shortage of cutting-edge equipment, such as ventilators, also poses a risk and could lead to difficult decisions about prioritizing treatment. In response to the situation, Japan's health ministry has issued guidelines on handling an influx of coronavirus patients. The government has the power to declare a state of emergency, but Prime Minister Abe has stated that the conditions do not warrant such a declaration yet. Overall, Japan is facing challenges in managing the coronavirus outbreak due to its aging population, limited hospital capacity, and potential surge in cases. The government is taking measures to address the situation, but there are concerns about the ability to handle a large number of severe cases and the ethical implications of resource allocation.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover.

99,99,9751,Testing for more breast cancer genes offers useful information,"The article discusses a study that investigated the clinical usefulness of additional genetic panels for breast cancer testing, beyond the routine BRCA1/2 tests. The study found that out of over 1,000 women who tested negative for BRCA mutations, 63 tested positive for non-BRCA mutations. The researchers determined that 33 of these women would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. The article mentions the potential benefits of panel testing for this study population. However, the article also highlights some limitations and concerns. It states that the cost of panel testing is not mentioned, and insurance coverage for panel testing is not as uniform as it is for BRCA1/2 testing. The article notes that there are established guidelines for BRCA1/2 testing, but not for panel testing. It suggests that more detail on cost and insurance coverage would have been helpful. The article mentions potential harms of panel testing, including uncertain results leading to psychological difficulties and the possibility of unnecessary surgical procedures. It also discusses the complexity of interpreting the results and the need for caution in broad-based testing. However, it does not mention important terms such as ""analytic validity"" and ""clinical validity"" which are key issues in genetic testing. The article does not clarify whether the management of women with positive panel test results improved their ultimate outcome, such as cancer diagnoses or survival. It suggests that the article could have mentioned the CDC's ACCE model, which evaluates scientific data on emerging genetic tests. The article acknowledges that breast cancer is a real concern for many women and mentions that several of the study's authors have links to the industry and companies that produce genetic test panels. It also quotes from an editorial written by an expert not involved in the study. The article suggests that conducting an interview with an outside expert could have provided additional context. Overall, the article discusses the benefits and limitations of panel testing for breast cancer genes. It mentions the novelty of the research and the potential actionable information provided by these tests. However, it suggests that more context on the use and availability of genetic test panels would have been beneficial.",true,"This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)","The article discusses a study that investigated the clinical usefulness of additional genetic panels for breast cancer testing, beyond the routine BRCA1/2 tests.

The article mentions the potential benefits of panel testing for this study population.

However, the article also highlights some limitations and concerns. It states that the cost of panel testing is not mentioned, and insurance coverage for panel testing is not as uniform as it is for BRCA1/2 testing. The article notes that there are established guidelines for BRCA1/2 testing, but not for panel testing. It suggests that more detail on cost and insurance coverage would have been helpful.

The article mentions potential harms of panel testing, including uncertain results leading to psychological difficulties and the possibility of unnecessary surgical procedures. It also discusses the complexity of interpreting the results and the need for caution in broad-based testing. However, it does not mention important terms such as ""analytic validity"" and ""clinical validity"" which are key issues in genetic testing.

The article does not clarify whether the management of women with positive panel test results improved their ultimate outcome, such as cancer diagnoses or survival. It suggests that the article could have mentioned the CDC's ACCE model, which evaluates scientific data on emerging genetic tests.

The article acknowledges that breast cancer is a real concern for many women and mentions that several of the study's authors have links to the industry and companies that produce genetic test panels. It also quotes from an editorial written by an expert not involved in the study. The article suggests that conducting an interview with an outside expert could have provided additional context.

Overall, the article discusses the benefits and limitations of panel testing for breast cancer genes. It mentions the novelty of the research and the potential actionable information provided by these tests. However, it suggests that more context on the use and availability of genetic test panels would have been beneficial.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Context: Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman approved the county’s application Friday, making it the ninth county in the state to receive approval to move into phase two of the four-phase reopening process. Those counties can allow restaurants to open at 50% of capacity. Hair and nail salons, tattoo and makeup artists, and stores also can start reopening with additional protections in place. Counties applying for a quicker reopening must currently have a population of less than 75,000 and no new cases of COVID-19 in the last three weeks, among other stipulations, in order to be approved. The other eight counties of the 39 in Washington that can begin the second phase include: Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Skamania, Stevens and Wahkiakum. Inslee and health officials have said other counties may enter phase two on June 1, depending on public-health COVID-19 data. Reopening businesses must comply with health and safety requirements outlined in their industry’s guidance, officials said. More than 17,950 people in Washington state have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 992 have died. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, and the vast majority recover. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness and death in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.
Claim: Whitman County 9th county approved for phase 2 reopening.
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
Whitman County in Eastern Washington has been given the OK to take a faster path to reopening businesses, including restaurants, under Gov. Jay Inslee’s coronavirus recovery plan.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a political ad by Rick Barber, a tea party enthusiast running for Congress in Alabama's Second District Republican run-off. The ad features Barber having a fictitious conversation with three Founding Fathers, where he rails against the IRS and the health care bill. The article examines Barber's claims in the ad and fact-checks them. One claim made by Barber in the ad is that ""without representation, the IRS can increase taxes."" The article points out that the IRS does not have the authority to increase taxes, as that power lies with Congress. The Constitution states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes. Barber argues that he meant the lack of proper representation in Washington, but the article finds this explanation disingenuous. Another claim made by Barber is that the IRS is going to force people to buy health insurance. The article clarifies that it was Congress, not the IRS, that passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which establishes a penalty for those who choose not to have insurance. The IRS would enforce the tax penalties, but it would be incorrect to say that the IRS is requiring people to buy insurance. The article also addresses Barber's comment about the Founding Fathers revolting against a tea tax. A history professor explains that the issues that led to the American Revolution were more complex than just the tax on tea. The Americans were concerned about being taxed without their consent and not being represented in Parliament. Overall, the article concludes that Barber's claims in the ad are incorrect. The IRS does not have the power to increase taxes without representation, and it is Congress that passed the health care bill, not the IRS. The article suggests that the Founding Fathers would not appreciate being misled and rules Barber's statement as false.
Claim: Without representation, (the IRS) can increase taxes.
