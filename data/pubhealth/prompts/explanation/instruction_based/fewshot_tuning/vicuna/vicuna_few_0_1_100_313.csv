0,0,295,WHO recommends one-hour maximum screen time per day for under-5s.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life. The WHO advises that children between the ages of one and four should spend at least three hours participating in various physical activities throughout the day. Infants under one should engage in floor-based play and avoid all screens. The organization warns against excessive use of electronic screens with young children. The WHO emphasizes that preventing obesity and related diseases should start in early life, as being inactive contributes to the rising numbers of overweight and obese individuals worldwide. Currently, 40 million children under the age of five are overweight, with 50 percent of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. This translates to 5.9 percent of children globally. The WHO guidelines are based on evidence from numerous studies, many of which were conducted in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. The organization highlights that sedentary behaviors, such as using motorized transport instead of walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, and playing inactive screen-based games, are associated with poor health outcomes. Chronic insufficient sleep in children has also been linked to increased fat accumulation. Shorter sleep duration is often associated with more screen time and playing computer games. The WHO's guidelines aim to promote healthy habits and lifestyle routines during early childhood, a period of rapid physical and cognitive development. The organization stresses the importance of addressing these issues early on to prevent premature death from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain forms of cancer.",true,"Young children should not spend more than an hour a day watching television and videos or playing computer games and infants less than one year old should not be exposed to electronic screens at all, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

1,1,11286,Stem cell experiment lets diabetics forgo insulin,"A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years. The main finding of the research is that the experimental treatment seems to cure diabetes in these patients. However, the broadcast fails to mention the cost of the procedure or project any potential costs. It does highlight the potential dangers of the procedure, such as infections resulting from the suppression of the immune system. The broadcast does not mention the possibility that the remarkable findings could be due to chance or bias, as pointed out by the researchers themselves. The findings will need to be validated through randomized studies that compare the new treatment to standard care or a placebo, and follow patients for a longer period of time. The broadcast does not explain this. There is no evidence of disease-mongering in the broadcast, as it presents a balanced view from cautious researchers, an academic ethicist, and a mother of a child with Type I diabetes. The broadcast also highlights the current standard of care for Type I diabetes, which involves insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It shows a young girl managing her disease through this routine, illustrating the hardships and discipline required. The broadcast emphasizes that the stem cell therapy is experimental and not widely available. While the broadcast suggests that this form of stem cell therapy is new, similar treatments for Type I diabetes have been experimented with since the 1990s. There is no obvious use of text from a press release in the broadcast.",true,"The NBC broadcast nicely contrasts the demands that glucose monitoring and insulin shots impose on Type I diabetes patients with the tremendous uncertainty associated with experimental stem cell treatments that might free patients from these daily routines. It summarizes the treatment’s apparent benefits and potential harms, as well as ethical concerns about exporting research on dangerous treatments to countries such as Brazil where patients may not fully understand the risks. If the broadcast has a weakness, it is that it fails to mention the limitations inherent in any small, nonrandomized, nonblinded study with short follow-up that investigates a new treatment in patients with a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. (See “Evidence” above.) Even if the treatments were relatively safe and conducted in the U.S., viewers should understand that such studies are awash in potential biases and should always be approached with caution.","A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years.

The article also highlights the high levels of fine particulate air pollution, known as PM2.5, in Beijing and the surrounding region, which far exceed the World Health Organization's guidelines. The article then focuses on two entrepreneurs who have capitalized on the demand for fresh air. Moses Lam, the founder of Vitality Air, sells cans of fresh air collected from Banff National Park in Canada. He has customers in China, India, South Korea, and Vietnam. Lam mentions that pollution and sales of his product go hand in hand, with a spike in sales during the winter months when pollution worsens due to heating and coal burning. Leo De Watts, the founder of AethAer, sells empty-looking jars filled with air from pristine parts of Great Britain. The article notes that these products may be bought more as novelty or collector's items rather than practical sources of clean air. The article also mentions a Chinese philanthropist, Chen Guangbiao, who handed out cans of fresh air as a political statement about the environment. He emphasized the need to prioritize the ecological environment over GDP growth and profits.

The claim that Chinese people are selling each other bags of fresh air due to air pollution is partially true. While it is true that some entrepreneurs have capitalized on the demand for fresh air by selling it in various forms, it is important to note that this is not a widespread practice. The sale of fresh air is more of a novelty or collector's item rather than a practical source of clean air. Additionally, the classification of smog as a natural disaster has caused controversy and concerns that it may reduce pressure on officials to address the problem. However, the severity of air pollution in China cannot be denied, and efforts to address the issue are ongoing.","The claim that Chinese people are selling each other bags of fresh air due to air pollution is partially true.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The video in question, which shows the aftermath of a school prank involving spiked lemonade, is not real. It was uploaded to the website LiveLeak in mid-September 2018 and gained millions of views on Facebook. However, the footage is actually taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal. The show is a satirical take on true crime documentaries and focuses on juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism in a high school setting. The second season of American Vandal, which premiered shortly before the viral video, features an episode called ""Brown Out."" In this episode, students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in Bellevue, Washington, are poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade and suffer from mass defecation. The opening sequence of this episode, which shows the students soiling themselves, was described as disgusting by The New Yorker. Some of the footage from the viral hoax video can also be seen in a trailer for the second season of American Vandal. This confirms that the video is not a real incident but a staged scene from the show. In summary, the claim that the video captures real students suffering from diarrhea after a prank involving spiked lemonade is false. The video is actually a scene from the Netflix mockumentary series American Vandal, which depicts fictional events in a high school setting.
Claim: A video shows the aftermath of a school prank in which a student spiked lemonade with laxatives.

6,6,8780,New antibody drug helps cells kill blood cancer.,"A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer. In a Phase I trial, all seven patients who received the highest dose of blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The drug works by binding cancer cells to cytotoxic T-cells, allowing them to effectively kill the tumor without causing uncontrolled T-cell activity. This is a significant breakthrough as scientists have struggled to find a way to trigger a T-cell attack against tumors. Micromet Inc, the company developing blinatumomab, hopes to conduct a pivotal clinical trial next year to gain regulatory approval. The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL. Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue. Overall, the results of the Phase I trial for blinatumomab in NHL are promising and provide hope for patients with previously incurable blood cancer. The drug's ability to activate T-cells in a controlled manner without causing excessive T-cell activity is a significant advancement in cancer treatment.

The article mentions that on June 20, 2015, a Facebook user shared a screenshot of a text message describing a harrowing near miss abduction effort that supposedly occurred in the bathroom of a Dillard's department store in Denton, Texas. The text message claimed that two girls hid in the bathroom, pinned down the daughter, and injected her with black laced heroin, paralyzing her. The two girls then claimed that the daughter was their drunk friend and they were taking her home. The post also mentioned that these two girls worked for sex trafficking in Denton. The article points out that this claim is similar to other messages spread on social media about kidnappers working on behalf of sex traffickers. These messages often lack verifiable documentation and rely on the ""friend of a friend"" narrative. The article mentions other instances of similar claims, such as a warning about abductors in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store and warnings about human traffickers targeting college kids through job interviews.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Prosser stated that Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer in the state Department of Justice only involved the prosecution of cases regarding the regulation of docks. Prosser argued that his own experience as a district attorney and lawmaker made him more qualified for the position. The article examines the validity of Prosser's claim by looking at the cases handled by Kloppenburg during her time at the Department of Justice. Prosser's campaign provided evidence of 46 cases involving Kloppenburg, with 76% of them related to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). However, only five of these cases dealt directly with docks. The Kloppenburg campaign provided a list of 17 published decisions of cases she argued before the state Appeals Court, none of which involved docks. They also mentioned that Kloppenburg had argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts and before the state Supreme Court, with few, if any, involving docks or piers. Prosser later admitted that he was aware of the breadth of cases handled by Kloppenburg and that his comment about docks was a ""rhetorical flourish."" However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent Kloppenburg's record. Prosser's comment aligns with attacks from Kloppenburg's critics in the campaign, suggesting that it was not meant as a joke. In conclusion, the article finds that Prosser's claim about Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer is false.

Disney's daughter, Diane, wrote in 1972 that there was no truth to the rumor that her father wished to be frozen and doubted that he had ever heard of cryonics. Available documentation indicates that Disney was cremated, which is consistent with his publicly stated wish to not have a funeral. The article also addresses other rumors surrounding Disney's death, such as the delay in announcing his death and the secrecy surrounding his funeral. These rumors are debunked with explanations that are consistent with ordinary circumstances and Disney's own preferences. Overall, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Walt Disney arranged to have himself frozen in a cryonic chamber.

14,14,6360,Judge: Treatment of Tennessee inmates with hep C improving.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160. The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment. Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider. The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases. Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population. Judge Crenshaw emphasized the importance of implementing the 2019 HCV Guidance and accelerating the approval of inmates for treatment to avoid future claims of inadequate treatment.",true,A federal judge in Nashville ruled this week that Tennessee’s treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C is not grossly inadequate but warned the state to make good on its promises to treat more patients more quickly.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C.

While a guideline memo was issued in September 2011 stating that religious items, including Bibles, could not be used or given away during visits, this rule was not enforced and was rescinded four months later. The intention behind the rule was to protect patients from unwanted proselytizing, but it was worded too broadly and caused public outcry. Walter Reed officials quickly clarified that the policy as stated in the memo was incorrect, had not been enforced, and had been rescinded. The hospital spokesperson explained that the guidelines were developed to respect patients' own beliefs and that visitors were allowed to bring religious materials if they wished. The hospital was revising the policy to ensure it was articulated correctly and to protect patients' religious practices and culture. Another memorandum in January 2012 canceled the controversial instructions, and it was clarified that the policy was established in response to complaints from patients and families who were approached by unsolicited faith-based groups making disparaging remarks and using threatening language. The policy was not intended to limit religious expression of patients and family members were always allowed to bring religious materials.","The claim that Walter Reed Medical Center prohibits the use or distribution of religious items during visits with patients is a mixture of true and false information.

19,19,12694,It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.,"U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, has been critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but opposed his party's health care plan. Yoho claims that the ACA has driven people to Medicaid, a program he describes as a worldwide failure. However, when asked for evidence to support his claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world, Yoho's spokesman walked back the statement, saying that Yoho meant to point out that health care trends have not improved since the implementation of the ACA. Experts interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. While Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, research about outcomes comes with caveats. Medicaid recipients start out sicker, and healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care. Yoho referred to two articles by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, to support his claim. One article discussed a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon, which found that recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Another article by Cass cited a Harvard study that compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine, and New York with other states that made no change. The study found that only New York achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, the study's author, Ben Sommers, has since done additional research and found that deaths from treatable causes did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study found that differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals are not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. However, more research is needed to determine the effects on health outcomes. In conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes.

20,20,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs. In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative.

26,26,11330,Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk,"The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The study involved 899 participants who were followed for an average of 9 years. During the study, 99 people developed dementia, resulting in a total incidence of dementia of 11%. The article mentions that consuming two or more servings of fish per week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%. However, it notes that this is a relative risk reduction and does not provide the absolute risk of developing dementia, which would be necessary to put the relative risk reduction into context. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil, had a lower risk of developing dementia. Plasma DHA levels were seen to correlate with the number of servings of fish or the amount of DHA consumed. The article also mentions potential harms from fish oil consumption and speculates on potential harms from fish consumption. It suggests that other behaviors associated with reduced dementia, such as social activities or better dietary variety, may be more common in those who eat more fish, potentially confounding the results. The article points out that neither DHA nor fish oil supplements have FDA approval for the prevention of dementia. It also mentions that DHA is found in fatty fish and fish oil supplements, but curiously includes ""some meats"" as a source of DHA. However, DHA is primarily found in significant quantities in the brain, retina, and testes, which are not frequently consumed by people. Overall, the article reports on the findings of the study and includes quotes from the study's senior author and an editorial about the research. It does not appear to rely on a press release and does not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer's disease.",mixture,"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it is information that a reader should be aware of. The headline of the story – ""Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk"" – is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled ""Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease"" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease.

Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally. The WHO has recommended several measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and wearing masks in public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also recommended the use of masks in public settings, especially in areas with high community transmission. In addition, many countries have implemented travel restrictions and quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus. The virus is highly contagious and can be spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also survive on surfaces for a period of time, which is why cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces is important. The WHO has also recommended the use of face masks in public to prevent the spread of the virus.

30,30,12749,On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. Williams initially stated that he would not seek life without parole for individuals under 18, but a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that his stance had changed. Williams responded with a letter to the editor, stating that his approach is consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court. The article explains that the issue of juvenile lifers became complicated when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision, which prohibited mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles, would apply retroactively. This led to a process of resentencing individuals across the state, with judges having the final determination on each case. The Inquirer reported that Williams' office intends to seek life without parole for at least three of the cases it has reviewed so far. Williams' chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, stated that while Williams hopes not to have many juvenile murderers remain in custody, there are certain circumstances, such as heinous crimes, where life without parole may be necessary. PolitiFact questioned whether this move conflicts with Williams' previous statements that all 300 individuals would have a chance at parole. Martin argued that the judge would have the final determination, but this contradicts what the DA's office is requesting. The article concludes by stating that Williams' original goal was to give all juvenile lifers some chance of parole, but in the most heinous cases, this goal may not be met. The DA's office argues that Williams' stance has not changed, as he always acknowledged that there could be exceptions. Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding Williams' stance on parole for juvenile lifers and the discrepancy between his previous statements and the actions of his office.",false,"District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward.

The Senate Appropriations committee approved a portion of the stimulus plan that states ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" The committee report justifies this spending by highlighting the high number of new STD infections in the United States and the preventable cost to the healthcare system. The article concludes by noting that while the $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis, which are not always transmitted sexually. Therefore, the claim that the stimulus package includes $335 million specifically for STD prevention programs is accurate, but it is important to recognize that the funding is allocated for a broader range of prevention programs as well.

Context: The claim is that the House Democrats' stimulus package includes $335 million to fund prevention programs for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This claim has been widely cited by Republican leaders as a way to discredit the stimulus plan. The National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release criticizing 29 freshman House Democrats for supporting a spending plan that includes this funding. Republican Representative Eric Cantor also made this point in an interview with Fox News. The issue gained momentum after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it on its website. The article confirms that there is indeed STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats. The bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs.""

33,33,9272,Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers,"The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers. However, the release lacks important information such as the cost of the drug compared to other asthma treatments currently in use. The release also fails to provide quantification of the results of the clinical tests and does not mention any potential side effects of the drug. The full research paper, which is behind a paywall, includes a table of adverse events experienced by patients in the study. The release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data regarding the reduction of eosinophil in sputum. However, it falls short in providing other indicators that would have strengthened it. The release includes funding sources but fails to mention any linkages between the study's authors and pharmaceutical firms, which is important for readers to ascertain bias. There is also no mention of alternative treatments for asthma or a comparison with current approaches. The release claims that the asthma pill is the first new one in nearly 20 years, but this is incorrect as several new drugs have come on the market in recent years. The release includes a conservative headline but allows the main researcher to proclaim the drug as a ""game changer"" and includes a testimonial from a study participant. The release also fails to include commentary from two unaffiliated experts, which would have improved its value.",false,"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily. The latter of the two didn’t offer “anything beyond what is in the news release,” according to reviewers.","The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers.

36,36,5367,TravelLab: Adults take over science museums when night falls.,"Science museums are hosting adult sleepovers, allowing grown-ups to explore the exhibits and learn about science in a unique and immersive way. The trend started at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which capitalized on the popularity of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. The sleepovers have become a hot ticket, with other science centers and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, and elsewhere following suit. During the sleepovers, guests have the opportunity to explore the museum's permanent exhibition halls, join guided tours, visit the planetarium, and meet with curators and museum scientists. The experience allows adults to experience the museum in a special way, without the crowds and rush of a typical visit during the day. The sleepovers also provide a chance for adults to have fun and embrace their inner child. Some attendees dress up in dinosaur costumes or onesies, adding to the playful atmosphere. The sleepovers typically include dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and guests can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum's cots, located below a 94-foot-long blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The sleepovers also have a scientific purpose. The quiet and stillness of the nighttime environment allows visitors to better absorb and learn from the exhibits. Biologist John Karavias explains that during the day, visitors often feel rushed and only get superficial reactions to the exhibits. At night, however, the background noise is quieted down, allowing visitors to digest the science behind what they are seeing. The sleepovers also provide an opportunity for museum staff to educate guests about important scientific topics. For example, visitors learn about the effects of climate change on marine life, such as the impact of ocean acidification on starfish and sea urchins. They also learn about animals that glow and the hidden language they use to communicate with each other.

37,37,2326,Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.,"A review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization has found that among 73 lower and middle-income nations, only four have adequate resources in place to provide necessary care for women and newborns. The four countries are Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Jordan. The review states that more than three-quarters of the countries face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, relieving pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths, and 289,000 maternal deaths, with over 92 percent of these deaths occurring in the countries reviewed. Many of these countries lack the necessary infrastructure and regulatory systems to train midwives adequately. Data collection is also a problem. The report emphasizes the importance of women and girls' right to maternal and reproductive health and calls for a change in the current situation. The lack of midwifery services is not only a health crisis but also an economic one. Boosting midwifery services can reduce costly cesarean births, saving up to $128.5 million over three decades. Bangladesh is one country that has made some progress in training midwives, although birth-related mortality remains high. The report is part of the UN and WHO's larger effort to boost access to midwives by 2030.

42,42,3386,New York tries to keep alive flavored e-cigarette ban.,"The state of New York is attempting to extend its ban on flavored e-cigarettes for another 90 days. The ban, which went into effect in September, prohibits the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, with the exception of menthol and tobacco flavors.

The ban was initially blocked by a state appeals court in October, but the council wants to ensure that the emergency regulations remain in place if the courts uphold the ban. The Department of Health spokesperson expressed confidence that the court will recognize the public health emergency and the need for immediate action. The ban has faced criticism from opponents, including the Vapor Technology Association, who argue that it is government overreach and will harm small businesses and adult smokers who use flavors to quit. Supporters, such as the American Cancer Society's advocacy group, are pushing for the ban to be made permanent and for all flavored tobacco to be prohibited. Governor Andrew Cuomo has also expressed his intention to expand the ban to include menthol. Anti-tobacco and anti-vaping groups argue that there is no scientific basis for exempting menthol and that it has been unethically marketed towards African Americans. They also warn that mint and menthol flavors can still attract young people to e-cigarettes by masking the harshness of nicotine. In addition to the state ban, New York City Council has passed its own bill banning flavored vaping products, including menthol, which is expected to take effect in July 2020.

A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government.

The FBI declined to comment on specific accounts of interference, but stated that they were working to prevent unlawful distribution or hoarding of PPE during the pandemic. The Department of Homeland Security did not provide a comment on the matter.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City.

The technique involves removing faulty mitochondria, which can cause serious health problems, from embryos and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a female donor. This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor. The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues. The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases. The UK has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debates regarding pro-nuclear transfer techniques. However, it is not the first country to have children born using three-parent IVF treatment, as the world's first known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 with the help of US doctors at a clinic in Mexico. Critics of the treatment argue that it is a dangerous step that could lead to the creation of genetically modified ""designer babies."" Nevertheless, fertility specialists have praised the decision, with one calling it a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome. The license was granted following a change in the law last year that allowed the treatment to be carried out once it was ready for licensing.

However, it is not the first country to have children born using three-parent IVF treatment, as the world's first known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 with the help of US doctors at a clinic in Mexico. Critics of the treatment argue that it is a dangerous step that could lead to the creation of genetically modified ""designer babies."" Nevertheless, fertility specialists have praised the decision, with one calling it a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome. The license was granted following a change in the law last year that allowed the treatment to be carried out once it was ready for licensing. The HFEA will still need to approve each clinic and patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be performed. Overall, the decision to grant the license for three-parent IVF babies in the UK has been met with both praise and criticism, highlighting the ongoing ethical debate surrounding this technique.
Claim: Regulator grants license for Britain's first three-parent IVF babies.
The claim veracity: true

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK has granted a license to a team of doctors in Newcastle to carry out the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique, which could result in the birth of the first child created in Britain using this method by the end of the year. The technique involves removing faulty mitochondria, which can cause serious health problems, from embryos and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a female donor. This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor. The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues.

The investigation analyzed COVID-19 testing and case data collected by the Florida Department of Health (DOH) and found that many labs reported very high positivity rates for COVID-19. Snopes reviewed the report and confirmed that at least 45 labs did not report negative test results, showing 100% positivity, while others reported rates of 90% and higher. However, more than 300 labs did report negative test results, with much lower percentage rates. Public and private testing facilities are required to report their results to the DOH, which releases a daily report covering surveillance data for every county in the state. The DOH confirmed that some smaller, private labs were not reporting negative test results and stated that they were working with these labs to ensure comprehensive and transparent data. The department did not respond to questions about whether this lack of reporting could have skewed total case counts or how many negative test results were unreported. Labs interviewed by Snopes claimed that there were discrepancies and changes in the DOH's data reporting requirements. Pancare of Florida President R. Michael Hill stated that the DOH misdirected their data collection process and did not include certain testing methods in the county or state numbers. The DOH implemented an update to its electronic reporting process on July 1 to report all patient-specific results daily and began integrating previously reported data from PanCare as of July 16. Lab24 in Miami confirmed that it had tested around 10,000 people in Florida but was only required to notify health officials of positive results. Lee Memorial Hospital Lab reported both negative and positive test results accurately but noted that a hospital can have more than one entry in the DOH database, leading to different rates being reported. In conclusion, 33 labs in Florida were found to have not reported negative COVID-19 test results between March and July 2020, leading to accusations of tampering with data. The DOH confirmed the lack of reporting and stated that they were working with the labs to ensure comprehensive data.

What's undetermined: Although health officials said that all laboratories are required to report both positive and negative test results, testing facilities that Snopes spoke with said that among other discrepancies in reporting requirements, the Florida Department of Health did not previously require negative test results to be reported.

The investigation analyzed COVID-19 testing and case data collected by the Florida Department of Health (DOH) and found that many labs reported very high positivity rates for COVID-19. Snopes reviewed the report and confirmed that at least 45 labs did not report negative test results, showing 100% positivity, while others reported rates of 90% and higher. However, more than 300 labs did report negative test results, with much lower percentage rates.

Public and private testing facilities are required to report their results to the DOH, which releases a daily report covering surveillance data for every county in the state. The DOH confirmed that some smaller, private labs were not reporting negative test results and stated that they were working with these labs to ensure comprehensive and transparent data. The department did not respond to questions about whether this lack of reporting could have skewed total case counts or how many negative test results were unreported.

Labs interviewed by Snopes claimed that there were discrepancies and changes in the DOH's data reporting requirements. Pancare of Florida President R. Michael Hill stated that the DOH misdirected their data collection process and did not include certain testing methods in the county or state numbers. The DOH implemented an update to its electronic reporting process on July 1 to report all patient-specific results daily and began integrating previously reported data from PanCare as of July 16.

Lab24 in Miami confirmed that it had tested around 10,000 people in Florida but was only required to notify health officials of positive results. Lee Memorial Hospital Lab reported both negative and positive test results accurately but noted that a hospital can have more than one entry in the DOH database, leading to different rates being reported.

In conclusion, 33 labs in Florida were found to have not reported negative COVID-19 test results between March and July 2020, leading to accusations of tampering with data. The DOH confirmed the lack of reporting and stated that they were working with the labs to ensure comprehensive data. However, the reasons for the lack of reporting and the impact on total case counts are still unclear.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

55,55,10570,Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality,"A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device. The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators. The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing.

57,57,17766,"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.","The claim that ""In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths"" is not supported by accurate data. State Sen. Maria Sachs made this claim while proposing to make texting while driving a primary offense in Florida. The claim was based on an op-ed piece written by AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson and a study done by the Cohen Children's Medical Center in Long Island, NY. However, the study's chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, stated that the media wrongly attributed the drinking-texting conclusions to his team's studies. The study analyzed CDC data and found that 45% of U.S. high school students reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. However, the study did not directly compare texting and drinking while driving, making Sachs' conclusion questionable. The study also found that students who admitted to texting while driving were more likely to engage in other risky behaviors on the road, such as not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and drinking and driving. This correlation makes it difficult to determine the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths. The involvement of cell phones in accidents is underreported, making it challenging to gather accurate data. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data contradicted Sachs' claim, stating that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. NHTSA reported that 12% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes were distracted, with 24% of those distracted drivers using a cell phone. In comparison, 20% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes had alcohol in their system. While texting while driving is undoubtedly dangerous, it has not surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths. The data is imperfect, and there may be an undercount in deaths associated with texting while driving.",false,"Sachs’ statistic -- that starting in 2011, texting began surpassing alcohol as the leading contributing factor to teen driving deaths -- was based on a misinterpretation of a scientific study and information from NHTSA that could not be confirmed. In reality, NHTSA’s analysis of their data found that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. While there’s no question that texting while driving is a danger, it hasn’t supplanted alcohol as ""the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" However, the figures are imperfect enough that we can't rule out an undercount in deaths associated with texting while driving.","The claim that ""In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths"" is not supported by accurate data. State Sen. Maria Sachs made this claim while proposing to make texting while driving a primary offense in Florida. The claim was based on an op-ed piece written by AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson and a study done by the Cohen Children's Medical Center in Long Island, NY. However, the study's chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, stated that the media wrongly attributed the drinking-texting conclusions to his team's studies.

The study analyzed CDC data and found that 45% of U.S. high school students reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. However, the study did not directly compare texting and drinking while driving, making Sachs' conclusion questionable. The study also found that students who admitted to texting while driving were more likely to engage in other risky behaviors on the road, such as not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and drinking and driving. This correlation makes it difficult to determine the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.

The involvement of cell phones in accidents is underreported, making it challenging to gather accurate data. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data contradicted Sachs' claim, stating that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. NHTSA reported that 12% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes were distracted, with 24% of those distracted drivers using a cell phone. In comparison, 20% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes had alcohol in their system.

59,59,7685,China expands switch from polluting coal heating in 2018: environment minister.,"China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie. Last year, 4.8 million households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity, up from 4 million households in 2017. China's winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal annually, and converting to low-emission heating was seen as a key part of the country's fight against pollution. Additionally, China has implemented ultra-low emissions technology in over 80 percent of its coal-fired power generation capacity. However, Li Ganjie warned that despite the progress made in 2018, China's battle against smog is becoming more challenging. He stated that the easy tasks have already been completed, and the remaining tasks are more difficult. While China reduced the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent in 2018, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, Li Ganjie believes it is still too high. He also mentioned regional disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection measures. China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry is determined to continue its efforts to curb pollution. However, concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 increased over the winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities rising by 13 percent from October to February. In response to these challenges, China announced that it would implement special emissions restrictions for the third consecutive winter. Premier Li Keqiang also stated that the government would continue to strengthen pollution controls in 2019.

Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan compared the situation to the coal industry, stating that these companies are trying to avoid regulation. The CEOs at Davos have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging through various initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme. However, Greenpeace argues that recycling is not enough and calls for plastic packaging bans and a goal of ""peak plastic."" The issue of plastic waste has gained prominence due to alarming statistics, such as 8 million tonnes of plastic being dumped into the oceans each year, causing harm to marine life and entering the food chain. The CEOs of Unilever and PepsiCo have acknowledged the urgency of the issue and have made commitments to reduce plastic packaging. Unilever, for example, promised in 2017 to ensure that all of its plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. Several companies, including Carrefour, Tesco, PepsiCo, and Unilever, have signed up for a pilot waste-reduction program unveiled at Davos, which involves delivering products in reusable bottles and collecting them for cleaning and re-use. The plastic debate has also caught the attention of the insurance industry, with Swiss Re's CEO stating that if companies face lawsuits for their plastic waste, it could impact their ability to obtain insurance coverage. Greenpeace's call for more bans on plastic packaging was met with resistance from Unilever and PepsiCo, who argue that the issue requires multiple solutions, including recycling, re-use, and new packaging technologies. The European Union recently passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items by 2021, but Greenpeace called for further reduction targets. Greenpeace and other critics argue that industry initiatives alone are not enough to solve the plastic waste problem, as many companies are expanding production of single-use plastic.

Unilever, for example, promised in 2017 to ensure that all of its plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. Several companies, including Carrefour, Tesco, PepsiCo, and Unilever, have signed up for a pilot waste-reduction program unveiled at Davos, which involves delivering products in reusable bottles and collecting them for cleaning and re-use. The plastic debate has also caught the attention of the insurance industry, with Swiss Re's CEO stating that if companies face lawsuits for their plastic waste, it could impact their ability to obtain insurance coverage. Greenpeace's call for more bans on plastic packaging was met with resistance from Unilever and PepsiCo, who argue that the issue requires multiple solutions, including recycling, re-use, and new packaging technologies. The European Union recently passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items by 2021, but Greenpeace called for further reduction targets. Greenpeace and other critics argue that industry initiatives alone are not enough to solve the plastic waste problem, as many companies are expanding production of single-use plastic. French Secretary of State for Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy, Brune Poirson, criticized the companies for not taking enough initiative and stated that government intervention is necessary.

Consumer goods CEOs faced criticism and pressure over their handling of plastic waste at the World Economic Forum in Davos, with Greenpeace comparing their situation to the coal industry's handling of climate change. The CEOs have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging through various initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme, but Greenpeace argues that recycling is not enough and calls for plastic packaging bans and a goal of ""peak plastic.""

However, the article points out that the harm of unnecessary biopsies was mentioned, but the increased number of biopsies was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute value.

66,66,644,Climate change endangers Scotland's archaeological treasures.,"Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change. With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change. A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970. Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers. In 2018, it attracted 112,000 visitors. HES climate change scientist David Harkin emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and protect these archaeological treasures. He acknowledges that climate change is already happening and that the pace of change will accelerate. However, he also believes that there is an opportunity to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and avoid the destruction of sites like Skara Brae. In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to Scotland's archaeological treasures on the Orkney Islands. Erosion, increased precipitation, rising sea levels, beach erosion, and storminess are all contributing to the deterioration of these historical sites. Urgent action is needed to protect and preserve these valuable cultural heritage sites.",true,"Ancient British structures older than the pyramids are being threatened by climate change, experts have warned, as rising sea levels, heavier rainfall and severe weather events endanger Scotland’s archaeological treasures.","Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change.

Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change.

A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970.

Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers. In 2018, it attracted 112,000 visitors.

HES climate change scientist David Harkin emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and protect these archaeological treasures. He acknowledges that climate change is already happening and that the pace of change will accelerate. However, he also believes that there is an opportunity to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and avoid the destruction of sites like Skara Brae.

In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to Scotland's archaeological treasures on the Orkney Islands. Erosion, increased precipitation, rising sea levels, beach erosion, and storminess are all contributing to the deterioration of these historical sites. Urgent action is needed to protect and preserve these valuable cultural heritage sites.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

67,67,10900,Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery,"A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery. Atrial fibrillation after surgery can lead to longer hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. The study involved 60 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either botulinum toxin or saline injections. The results showed that there were no additional complications from the Botox injections compared to the saline group. However, more details about the study, such as baseline differences between the groups and the number of vessels engrafted, were not provided. The funding sources for the study were noted as The Russian State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology and the Siberian Division of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The article also mentions that other attempts have been made to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery using different drugs, but with varying results. It is noted that botulinum toxin is already available and used in cosmetic dermatology under the trade name Botox Cosmetic. However, this is the first time it has been tested in human hearts, so it may take several years before it receives approval as a preventative for heart complications. The article concludes by stating that larger studies are needed to further investigate the potential benefits of botulinum toxin in preventing atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery.",true,"This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery.

70,70,10611,Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise,"A recent article titled ""Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise"" discusses a new experimental treatment for peanut allergies that has shown positive results in early studies.

Five patients were able to tolerate peanuts without any reaction, while four had to withdraw from the study due to intolerance to the treatment. The article also mentions that the second test involved splitting the subjects into treatment and placebo groups, with approximate outcomes for each group described. However, the article is criticized for not providing enough information about the methodology and outcomes of the studies. It is noted that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and the study groups were very small, consisting of only 33 and 18 subjects. The article should have made it clear from the beginning that the evidence is of low quality and that more study is needed. The article also fails to provide a sufficient warning about potential harms and the need for close medical supervision. It is mentioned in the last line that parents should not try the approach at home, but this warning should have appeared earlier. Additionally, the article does not mention whether those who did not tolerate the treatment required any intervention to quell allergic reactions. The only source quoted in the article is Dr. Wesley Burks of Duke University Medical Center, one of the researchers involved in the study. However, it is not disclosed that Burks has financial relationships with companies related to allergies. The article should have included an additional source with no connection to the research.

Context: The article examines the claim made by Scott Brown that Jeanne Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" The claim is based on two votes that Shaheen took in relation to a carbon tax. The first vote was on an amendment proposed by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, which stated that revenue generated by a future carbon tax must be given back to the public. Shaheen voted in favor of this amendment, but it did not actually enact a carbon tax. The second vote was on an amendment proposed by Senator Roy Blunt, which aimed to increase the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within a budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment. However, neither of these votes would have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition. The article also mentions that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax and instead supports ""market-driven solutions"" such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. In terms of her legislative record, Shaheen has focused on boosting energy efficiency, partnering with Senator Rob Portman to craft an energy efficiency bill that has failed to pass in the Senate. Based on these findings, the article concludes that Brown's claim is misleading. While Shaheen's votes align with some lawmakers who favor a carbon tax, they do not indicate that she voted to ""pave the way for a new national energy tax."" The votes were not procedural votes to initiate a debate or final vote on a carbon tax bill, and they would not have brought a carbon tax any closer to becoming a reality.

The video suggests that North Korea's team made it to the final and will face Portugal. However, the video is actually a fake and was created by an anonymous producer of the YouTube channel Korea News Backup. The article mentions that some bloggers and journalists believed that North Korea was trying to deceive its citizens with this video. However, the video is clearly a spoof and not an actual news broadcast. The article also addresses the reasons why the North Korean government would be unlikely to attempt such a stunt. Firstly, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the World Cup games, although not live. Additionally, most North Koreans would be aware that their team failed to qualify for the World Cup two years prior. The article quotes experts who explain that making it to the final would be impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds. The article also highlights some examples of creative license exercised by the North Korean government. For instance, the official biography of the previous leader, Kim Jong Il, claimed that he was born on Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture.

The details of this myth have changed over time, with different sources reporting different numbers of holes-in-one.

75,75,1308,Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned of shortages as more than 1.5 million Americans have received the vaccine since the end of last year. GSK has increased deliveries significantly and is vaccinating people against shingles at a faster rate than before, but it is struggling to keep up with the high demand. The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck's older and less effective vaccine, leading to strong demand. Consensus forecasts predict peak annual sales for Shingrix of around £1.5 billion ($2 billion), but Exane BNP analysts believe this estimate may be too low. They suggest sales could rise to £3 billion if Shingrix achieves market penetration rates of around 60%, similar to Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. In its first full quarter on the market, Shingrix achieved sales of £110 million, and GSK expects 2018 sales to exceed £400 million. Shingrix is a key product for GSK CEO Emma Walmsley as she aims to improve the company's commercial performance and demonstrate the profit potential of GSK's vaccines business. GSK has already achieved its mid-term goal of reaching vaccine margins of 30%, and Exane BNP believes it could reach 35% by 2020 with the introduction of Shingrix and other premium vaccines. Shingrix is administered in two doses, while Merck's Zostavax is a single shot. Ensuring patients adhere to the two-shot regimen will be crucial in maximizing the vaccine's sales potential. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which is also responsible for chickenpox.

Context: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug to treat a rare form of breast cancer. The drug, called Tukysa, is a type of therapy called a CDK4/6 inhibitor, which works by blocking the activity of two proteins that help cancer cells grow. The FDA says the drug can be used in combination with another drug called fulvestrant to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The approval was based on a clinical trial of 600 patients, which showed that the combination of Tukysa and fulvestrant reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 40% compared to treatment with fulvestrant alone. The most common side effects of the drug include low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, nausea, and diarrhea. The drug’s manufacturer, Seattle Genetics, says it will make Tukysa available to patients in the US within a week.

79,79,25422,A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.,"The article discusses a claim made by Hillary Clinton during a campaign speech in Shenandoah, Iowa. Clinton argued that the federal government is not adequately protecting the public due to insufficient inspections of toys and food. She used the example of a ham and cheese sandwich to illustrate her point, stating that a sandwich on one slice of bread falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which conducts daily inspections of manufacturers. However, a sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only inspects manufacturers about once every five years. To verify Clinton's claim, the article refers to government reports on food safety, interviews with the head of the USDA's food inspection service, and the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. It confirms that Clinton's example is correct, highlighting the significant disparity in inspections conducted by the two agencies. Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged the absurdity of the sandwich rule and admitted that it defies logic. However, he stated that the rule does not impact the safety of the nation's food supply. The article explains that the distinction between USDA and FDA jurisdiction over sandwiches can be traced back to Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, published in 1906. The book exposed horrific conditions in meat plants and led to the enactment of a law requiring meat inspections. Since then, the USDA has focused on meat and poultry inspections, while other foods fall under the FDA's purview. The FDA, however, does not have a mandate for regular inspections, and a report by the Government Accountability Office confirms that the agency inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years on average. Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, criticizes the current food safety system, stating that it is based on antiquated laws and divided agencies. She argues that the lack of regular inspections and insufficient funding for the FDA puts the public at risk. These concerns are echoed in a report from an FDA advisory panel, which states that the agency is overburdened and underfunded, making it unable to effectively conduct routine surveillance of the nation's food supply.

Context: The article discusses a study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, which found that people who eat fast food every day are more likely to develop metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of developing heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. The study followed 5,000 adults over a period of eight years and found that those who ate fast food daily were 56% more likely to develop metabolic syndrome than those who never ate fast food. The study also found that people who ate fast food three or more times a week were 42% more likely to develop metabolic syndrome than those who never ate fast food. The article notes that fast food is high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems.

Context: The United States has a long history of racial discrimination, dating back to the time of slavery. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement sought to end segregation and discrimination against African Americans. However, despite progress made in the decades since, racial disparities persist in many areas of American life. For example, African Americans are more likely to be arrested and incarcerated than white Americans, even for the same crimes. In 2015, the Department of Justice found that the Ferguson, Missouri police department was targeting black residents with fines and arrests in order to generate revenue for the city. The issue of police brutality against African Americans has also received national attention in recent years, with high-profile cases such as the deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Freddie Gray. These incidents have led to protests and calls for police reform. The Black Lives Matter movement was founded in response to these issues, and has gained widespread support and attention.

82,82,1972,Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.,"A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s. The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine. According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption. The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.",true,"Americans may be cutting back on super-sized meals, but waistlines continue to expand from more frequent eating, according to a study released on Wednesday.","A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years.

Context: A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s. The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine. According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption. The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.

84,84,4252,Judge tosses $417M award against Johnson & Johnson.,"A Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, Maren Nelson, has granted Johnson & Johnson's request for a new trial, overturning a $417 million award that was given to a woman who claimed that the company's talcum powder caused her ovarian cancer. The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision. He stated that they will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by the product. Echeverria had alleged that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential cancer risks associated with their talcum powder.

They emphasized that they will continue to defend the safety of their product as they prepare for additional trials in the United States.

However, a Missouri appellate court recently overturned a $72 million award to the family of a woman who had died, ruling that the state was not the proper jurisdiction for the case.

Context: The article discusses the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti, who have lost limbs as a result of the devastating earthquake that struck the country in 2010. The players, who train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti's largest slum, faced off in a match on the anniversary of the earthquake as a commemoration of the disaster. Many people in Haiti lost limbs in the earthquake, and the players have received treatment, athletic training, and prosthetic limbs through a program funded by Miami's Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus. Over 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs so far, with hundreds more set to begin treatment in the coming weeks and months. Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, there is a sense of pessimism and despair in Haiti. The country was already impoverished before the earthquake, with 70% of the population living on less than $2 a day. The rebuilding efforts have been slow, and major streets in the capital city of Port-au-Prince are still covered in debris. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who heads a reconstruction commission, has faced criticism for the lack of tangible results. The anniversary of the earthquake promises little in the way of celebration, with many people expressing disappointment in the lack of progress. The article also mentions the reopening of Port-au-Prince's restored Iron Market as part of the commemoration events. The market, a cultural and architectural landmark, was badly damaged in the earthquake and has been restored with funding from Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel. However, for many Haitians living in crowded camps, such projects hold little interest. The country has also faced other challenges, including a cholera epidemic and a controversial presidential election. The article ends by mentioning the nostalgia some Haitians have for the rule of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, who continued the rule of his father Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier. Despite the ongoing experiment with democracy in Haiti, some people believe that things were better under the Duvalier regime. Overall, the article highlights the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti and the challenges the country continues to face in its recovery from the earthquake.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

However, when adjusting for population, Texas ranked 18th in worker deaths per 100,000 workers. Among states with more than 1 million employed, Texas ranked 10th. In terms of carbon emissions, Texas did have the highest amount of CO2 emissions in 2010. However, when adjusting for population, Texas would have tied for 13th place. The article also notes that Texas has a large number of industrial facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants, which contribute to its high emissions. Regarding high school graduates, the article states that Texas ranked last in percentage of high school graduates in 2009, with 79.9% of Texans having graduated from high school.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an alert regarding the over-prescription and misuse of the cough medicine Tussionex Pennkinetic Extended-Release Suspension, manufactured by UCB. The FDA has received reports of doctors over-prescribing the medicine and individuals taking it more frequently than recommended, as well as giving it to children under the age of 6, despite it not being approved for that age group. Tussionex contains hydrocodone, a narcotic pain reliever, and excessive consumption can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Since its approval in 1987, there have been reports of health problems and deaths among children and adults who took Tussionex. Five deaths have been reported among children under 6 who took the medicine. UCB has proposed a stronger warning for the medicine following these reports. The FDA is urging doctors and patients to follow prescribing instructions and use a medical syringe or other device designed to measure liquid medications, as household spoons vary in size and should not be used. UCB, based in Belgium, will update the Tussionex label to address these concerns. The FDA's alert aligns with UCB's efforts to ensure proper use of the product. The company had already taken steps to clarify the label in 2007. UCB does not plan to withdraw the product as the FDA alert only addresses improper use. In 2007, Tussionex sales in the U.S. totaled 114 million euros ($176 million).

91,91,27876,The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.,"The article confirms the claim that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. Giant hogweed is an invasive herb in the carrot family that was originally brought to North America from Asia. It has become established in various regions of the United States, including New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northwest. The plant grows along streams and rivers, as well as in fields, forests, yards, and roadsides. It can reach a height of 14 feet or more, with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width. The sap of the giant hogweed contains toxic chemicals called furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis. This condition leads to reddening of the skin, followed by severe blistering and burns. The injuries can last for several months, and even after they have healed, the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. If the sap enters the eyes, it can cause temporary or even permanent blindness. If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, it is recommended to take the following steps: if a reaction occurs, applying topical steroids early on may lessen the severity of the reaction and provide relief. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so it is advised to apply sunblock and keep the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible. The article also mentions that giant hogweed is not the only dangerous plant one might encounter. Other plants that can cause harm include oleander, a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways, and sago palm, a decorative shrub found in gardens and homes. In conclusion, the article confirms that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.

92,92,8845,Repeat blood clots more common with stents: study.,"A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot. This risk is particularly high for patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago. Stents are wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the coronary arteries to keep them from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. However, clots can form inside the stent, known as stent thrombosis, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack or death. The researchers found that the use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis. Patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment were 4.2 times more likely to experience another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who had previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times more likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times more likely to suffer a repeat episode. The study analyzed 437 patients with various types of stents who had experienced stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. Of these patients, 16.9 percent had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis, with 61 patients experiencing two episodes, 12 patients experiencing three episodes, and one patient experiencing four episodes. In conclusion, the study highlights the increased risk of repeat blood clots in patients who have had a coronary stent. The use of an additional stent during emergency treatment, a history of heart attack, and late stent thrombosis were identified as factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing another episode of stent thrombosis. These findings emphasize the importance of closely monitoring patients with stents to prevent further complications.",true,"Treating a stent-related blood clot with an additional stent in an emergency procedure sharply raises the risk that a patient will get a second clot and should be avoided, Dutch researchers said on Saturday.","A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot.

The study, published in the journal Nature, analyzed data from over 400,000 people in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Researchers found that people who consumed artificial sweeteners regularly were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who did not consume them. The study also found that people who consumed diet drinks regularly were at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who did not consume them. The study’s lead author, Dr. John L. Sievenpiper, said that the findings suggest that artificial sweeteners may not be a healthy substitute for sugar. He also noted that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between artificial sweeteners and diabetes risk. The study’s findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested a link between artificial sweeteners and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

93,93,1688,Amazonian tribe study shows how human bodily bacteria is changing.,"A study published in the journal Science Advances has found that the gut, mouth, and skin microbes of the Yanomami villagers, an isolated tribe in southern Venezuela's Amazonian jungles, possess the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in humans. The Yanomami villagers, who were secluded from the outside world until 2009, have bacteria that include some never before detected in humans. Surprisingly, the researchers also found antibiotic-resistant genes in the Yanomami's microbes, even though they have never been exposed to commercial antibiotics. The human body hosts trillions of microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, which are essential for human health. However, modern practices such as processed foods and antibiotics have led to a decline in microbiota diversity. This decline may be linked to the increase in immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes, and obesity. The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 Yanomami villagers and compared them to a group from the United States, another indigenous group from the Venezuelan Amazonian region called the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. The Yanomami villagers were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties compared to the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the other groups offer beneficial effects, such as protecting against kidney stones. The Yanomami villagers are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in a remote mountainous region. The researchers believe that studying their microbiota provides a unique opportunity to understand the impact of modern practices on human bodily bacteria.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease.

The majority of cases occur in the Northeast and Midwest, with New England being the region with the highest incidence. The CDC recommends that people in endemic areas take steps to prevent tick bites, such as using repellents, wearing protective clothing, and performing tick checks.

The article concludes by stating that the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines in early October for travelers from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports. These guidelines require travelers to go through an Ebola screening process, including temperature checks and questions about possible exposure. The article notes that even with these screening measures in place, it is possible that Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms. Overall, the article provides information about the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports and discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, who was the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States and mentions the existing airport screenings in West Africa and other countries.
Claim: Darrell Issa Says Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States ""with an elevated temperature.

Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California, falsely claimed that Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, had an elevated temperature when he arrived in the country. In reality, Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia, Liberia, where he had been screened for Ebola. He only reported falling ill several days after arriving in the United States. The airports in New York, New Jersey, and Illinois have implemented new guidelines for Ebola screening, which include quarantining anyone who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they are not showing symptoms. However, these guidelines have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, who argue that they are unnecessary. The CDC and Department of Homeland Security have instituted new airport screening guidelines for travelers from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports.

The city has received a government grant of 12.8 million euros to fund the project, but officials anticipate delays due to red tape, shortages of qualified staff, and the complexity of civil engineering and power grid overloads. The article highlights the growing number of electric cars in Germany and Europe, but notes that the charging infrastructure is not keeping pace with the demand. This could potentially hinder sales and the European Union's plan to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2050. The lack of off-street parking in some areas is also mentioned as a deterrent for drivers to switch to electric cars. Ruesselsheim aims to provide one charging point per 72 people, the highest level in Europe, with the help of carmaker Opel and the local RheinMain University. However, the installation of each charging point requires approval from various authorities and charging equipment makers have long lead times. The article also mentions the complications of different charging and payment processes across the country, as well as the funding challenges faced by Germany and other countries in expanding the charging infrastructure. The reluctance of energy providers to invest in the infrastructure while car sales remain low is highlighted as a potential obstacle. Without a sufficient number of charging stations, customers may be hesitant to switch to electric cars, creating a vicious circle.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.
