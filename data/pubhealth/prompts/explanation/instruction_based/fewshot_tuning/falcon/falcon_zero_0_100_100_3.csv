1,1,30895,"NFL players protesting police brutality are doing so because they have many children with different women, leading their families into lives of crime.","The article discusses a Facebook post that falsely claims that NFL players who protest police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem have many children with different women, which leads their families into lives of crime. The post specifically mentions retired players Antonio Cromartie, Travis Henry, Willis McGahee, Derrick Thomas, Bennie Blades, Ray Lewis, and Marshall Faulk, and highlights the number of children they have with multiple women. However, the post's premise that growing up in a single-parent household predicts criminal activity is false. According to a 2003 study by the Center for Law and Social Policy, children who grow up in families with both their biological parents in a low-conflict marriage tend to fare better in various aspects compared to children in single-parent or cohabiting-parent households. However, it is important to note that most children not living with married, biological parents still grow up without serious problems. The article also mentions that violent crime rates have significantly decreased over the years, while the decline of marriage has continued. This challenges the theory that family breakdown drives crime rates. The argument that growing up in a single-parent household leads to criminal behavior is therefore questionable. Furthermore, none of the players mentioned in the Facebook post are currently active in the NFL. Terricka Cromartie, Antonio Cromartie's wife, claimed in an Instagram post that her husband's employment was terminated because he kneeled during the national anthem, similar to Colin Kaepernick. However, Faulk, who is currently an analyst for the NFL Network, has expressed support for Kaepernick's protests, emphasizing that it is about holding someone accountable for lives being lost, particularly among black people.

3,3,17808,"Hank Johnson Says ""by reducing chronic health care costs in the State of Georgia, we can reduce the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs.","Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson claims that by reducing chronic health care costs in the state, the $32.8 billion lost each year due to lack of productivity and economic costs can also be reduced. Johnson's claim is based on a study done by the Milken Institute in 2007, which found that more than half of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases. The study focused on seven diseases, including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, mental disorder, pulmonary conditions, and strokes. In Georgia, the economic impact of these diseases was estimated to be $32.8 billion. The researchers calculated the number of lost workdays by using data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health Interview Survey and multiplying those days lost by wages per employee. Georgia's total was 3 percent of the national cost, which is proportional to the state's population. The lead researcher of the study, Ross DeVol, stated that the number is likely higher today. However, another report released by Gallup-Healthways in May estimated the total lost productivity from various health problems to be $84 billion a year. This report included chronic conditions such as asthma, cancer, depression, diabetes, heart attacks, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and physical pains. The estimated cost per worker per day was $341. The Gallup-Healthways report was based on interviews with 94,000 adults nationwide who worked more than 30 hours a week. The majority reported missing about one day every three months due to poor health. Johnson's claim is based on accurate information from the Milken Institute study, but there are differing estimates from other research. The CDC estimated the economic costs of cardiovascular diseases and stroke in 2009 to be $475.3 billion, including $122.4 billion in lost productivity.

Turkish TV footage showed people using shovels and their hands to dig through the rubble, while damaged buildings, fallen roofs, and cracked walls were observed in various villages. The governor of Van confirmed the loss of life and widespread destruction in the affected areas. The earthquake had a depth of 5 km and struck at 8:53 a.m. The second significant quake occurred at 7:00 p.m. Dozens of villages in Turkey were rattled, and nearly 150 tents were sent to provide shelter for affected families. The Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority initiated rescue operations in villages near the epicenter. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter to be 47 km west of the Iranian city of Khoy. Last month, another earthquake in eastern Turkey caused over 40 fatalities, while an earthquake in Iran caused structural damage to homes without resulting in any deaths. Rescue teams have been dispatched to the affected area in Iran's West Azarbaijan province, where several towns and villages suffered significant damage.

6,6,5485,Trump administration drops Obama-era water protection rule.,"The Trump administration has repealed an Obama-era rule that defined the waterways subject to federal regulation. The 2015 Waters of the United States rule aimed to clarify which waterways were protected under the Clean Water Act. Environmental groups criticized the move, arguing that it would lead to less safe drinking water and damage to wetlands that prevent flooding and provide habitat for wildlife. The administration plans to adopt a new rule by the end of the year that is expected to define protected waterways more narrowly than the Obama policy. The Clean Water Act requires landowners to obtain federal permits before developing or polluting navigable waterways, but disputes have long persisted over what other waters are subject to regulation. The Obama rule provided federal oversight to upstream tributaries and headwaters, including wetlands, ponds, lakes, and streams that can affect the quality of navigable waters. The Trump administration's action is seen as a rollback of environmental protections put into place under President Obama. Environmentalists argue that the repeal is a victory for land developers, oil and gas drillers, and miners who will exploit the ambiguity to dredge and fill small streams and wetlands. The Natural Resources Defense Council said the administration's action would be challenged in court. The American Farm Bureau Federation, on the other hand, welcomed the repeal, stating that the 2015 rule had generated a greater sense of urgency among its membership than any other issue. The question of which waters are covered under the Clean Water Act has inspired decades of lawsuits and numerous bills in Congress. The Supreme Court in 2006 produced three differing opinions on the matter, leading the Obama administration to craft its rule.",true,The Trump administration on Thursday revoked an Obama-era regulation that shielded many U.S. wetlands and streams from pollution but was opposed by developers and farmers who said it hurt economic development and infringed on property rights.,"The Trump administration has repealed an Obama-era rule that defined the waterways subject to federal regulation.

However, the director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research stated that they were never made aware that they should inform the NIH of their need for more fetal tissue. The Trump administration's policies on fetal tissue research were seen by many as a proxy debate over abortion. Anti-abortion groups campaigned for the government to cancel its contract with ABR, which led to the cancellation of the contract and the pause on fetal tissue research. The director of the Gladstone Center for HIV Cure Research believes that this change reflects a new political"

10,10,2791,Drug critic slams FDA over antibiotic oversight in meat production.,"The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a non-governmental group that criticizes the use of drugs in the meat industry, has conducted a study that raises concerns over the use of antibiotics in meat production. The study found that the FDA did not take action to remove 30 antibiotic-based livestock feed products from the market, even after federal investigators determined that many of these antibiotics did not meet current regulatory standards for protecting human health. The FDA had previously unveiled guidelines for drug makers and agricultural companies to voluntarily phase out antibiotic use as a growth enhancer in livestock, in an effort to combat the surge in human resistance to certain antibiotics. However, the NRDC's study suggests that the FDA has not effectively enforced these guidelines. The NRDC's study focused on a review conducted by the FDA from 2001 to 2010, which examined 30 penicillin and tetracycline-based antibiotic feed additives that had been approved for use in livestock and poultry to promote growth. The study found evidence to suggest that nine of these drugs are still on the market and used by livestock producers. One of the drugs still on the market is Zoetis Inc's Penicillin G Procaine 50/100, which is fed to poultry to aid in weight gain. The NRDC claims that the FDA twice expressed concerns to Zoetis about the drug failing to meet safety regulations. Some academics specializing in antibiotic resistance have criticized the NRDC's study, arguing that it does not reflect current regulatory standards as some of the drugs have been withdrawn from the market and the study assessed outdated FDA safety guidelines. However, the NRDC argues that its findings raise questions about the effectiveness of regulators in enforcing the new guidelines. The FDA has stated that it began reviewing older, approved penicillin and tetracycline products in 2001 and issued letters to companies asking for additional safety data. The agency claims to have employed a strategy to address concerns about the production use of medically important antimicrobials in food-producing animals. The FDA believes that its current strategy is the most efficient and effective way to change the use of these products in animal agriculture.

11,11,4978,Study challenges health benefits of moderate drinking.,"A study conducted in China challenges the belief that moderate drinking has health benefits. The researchers found that moderate drinking slightly increases the risk of stroke and high blood pressure. However, they were unable to determine if small amounts of alcohol also increase the chances of a heart attack. The study tracked over 500,000 people in China for a decade and recorded their medical history, including their alcohol consumption. The researchers took genetics into account by focusing on two variants common among East Asians that can make drinking unpleasant. For those with the variants, drinking alcohol can result in symptoms such as turning red, a fast heart rate, nausea, or headaches. The researchers found that alcohol increases the risk of stroke by about one-third for every four additional drinks per day. They also found no protective effects for moderate drinking. People who drink up to two drinks a day, which qualifies as moderate drinking, have an increased stroke risk of about 10% to 15% compared to nondrinkers. However, there were not enough heart attacks among the participants to draw a conclusion about heart risks. The study's senior author, Richard Peto of the University of Oxford, stated that the claims of alcohol having a protective effect have no serious scientific basis. He also mentioned that the findings should apply to other populations beyond China and to any alcoholic drinks, even though the study participants mostly drank spirits. In a journal commentary, the authors of the study called for stricter controls on alcohol, stating that its risks have been underestimated. They compared the alcohol industry to the tobacco industry and suggested that it should be regulated similarly.

Studies suggest that intermediate hosts are needed for the disease to spread from bats to humans, but meat consumption is not necessarily part of the equation. For example, the Ebola outbreak was initially thought to be linked to the consumption of bat meat, but it was later discovered that patient zero was likely infected through bat droppings.

The claim that ""COVID-19 started because we eat animals"" is false. The article explains that early on in the pandemic, there were baseless claims linking the disease to the consumption of bats in China. However, there is no evidence that eating meat is the source of the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, the claim that ""COVID-19 started because we eat animals"" is not supported by scientific evidence. While the virus likely originated from bats, there is no direct link between meat consumption and the outbreak. The Instagram post mentioned in the claim ignores critical facts and misrepresents the information from the CDC and WHO.

Allen West, the newly elected chairman of the Texas Republican Party, claimed that the recovery rate for COVID-19 in Texas is 99.9%. However, this claim is inaccurate.

The claim veracity: false

### Response:

The claim that the coronavirus has a 99.9% recovery rate in Texas is false. The recovery rate is calculated by dividing the number of people who have recovered from the virus by the total number of cases. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, as of July 27, 2020, there have been 385,923 positive cases of COVID-19 in Texas and 5,489 deaths. This means that the recovery rate is 98.7%, not 99.9%. Additionally, the recovery rate does not take into account the long-term health effects that some people may experience after recovering from the virus. Therefore, the claim that the coronavirus has a 99.9% recovery rate in Texas is false.

It mentions that the treatment costs $93,000 per patient, but fails to provide context by comparing it to alternative treatments. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine states that alternative treatments cost $1,800 per patient. The article also mentions that in clinical trials, Provenge extended the lives of certain men with advanced prostate cancer by about four months. However, it fails to mention that expert reviewers who analyzed the evidence for Medicare found the actual quantity of the benefit to be ""less certain"" due to weaknesses in the trials. This raises questions about the accuracy of the ""four months"" additional survival estimate. Furthermore, the article does not mention the potential harms associated with Provenge. Clinical trials reported infusion reactions, infections, and the FDA ordered further study of strokes in people who receive Provenge. The article also fails to adequately explain the shortcomings identified by expert reviewers in the trial design of Provenge. The reviewers rated the quality of evidence on survival as only ""fair"" and recommended further trials to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of Provenge. The article does not mention the differences in disease progression time between patients receiving Provenge and those in the control group, nor does it address the potential interactions between Provenge and other treatments. Although the article mentions that Provenge is approved for patients with advanced prostate cancer resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy, it does not include an independent source addressing the scientific issues raised by the Medicare analysis. Additionally, the article does not disclose that the cancer advocacy group cited in the article receives support from and promotes its services to health care corporations, including pharmaceutical companies.

In conclusion, the article provides a lukewarm review of Provenge but lacks important context, fails to address potential harms, and does not adequately explain the shortcomings identified by expert reviewers. It also lacks independent sources and does not mention alternative treatment approaches.",mixture,"This story reports on an analysis done for the agency that oversees Medicare of the evidence of the effects of Provenge (sipuleucel-T) in certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It summarizes some of the conclusions and includes comments about how the analysis might influence a decision about whether Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the expensive new treatment. But the story leaves readers with the impression that the drug has been proven to extend the life of the average patient by about four months when actually there are many uncertainties about that estimate due to weaknesses in the clinical trials sponsored by the maker of the Provenge. The assessment done for Medicare underscores the questions that still need to be answered in order for doctors and patients to know whether and how to use Provenge, but that perspective is largely missing from this story. This story portrays debates about insurance coverage of Provenge as a matter of how much value to place on four months of life. But what the federal analysis of the Provenge trials actually focuses on is uncertainty about the amount of additional survival and questions about how other factors besides Provenge (including other treatments that were given to the trial participants) might have affected the trial results. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer occurring in men, though most tumors grow slowly and men diagnosed with the disease typically die of something other than their prostate cancer. Some tumors are aggressive and more effective treatments are needed for these cases. Provenge’s novel immunotherapy approach offers an attractive alternative to existing treatments, but the initial application for FDA approval was rejected in 2007. A new clinical trial was done and the treatment was approved for sale in the U.S. earlier this year. Although historically Medicare and Medicaid have covered treatments deemed safe and effective without considering the magnitude of the expected benefit, the limited additional survival and the high cost of Provenge treatment have highlighted debates about whether and how to consider these factors in deciding whether a particular treatment should be reimbursed.","The article discusses the lukewarm review of the prostate cancer drug, Provenge.

Minnesota environmentalists aren’t excited about DFL’s wins.
The claim veracity: true

The claim is true because Minnesota environmentalists are not excited about DFL's wins. The DFL, or Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, is a political party in Minnesota that has traditionally been supportive of environmental causes. However, in recent years, the DFL has been less supportive of environmental causes, and environmentalists in Minnesota are not happy about this.

One reason why environmentalists are not excited about DFL's wins is because the DFL has been less supportive of environmental causes in recent years. For example, the DFL has been less supportive of renewable energy initiatives, and has been more supportive of fossil fuel projects. This has led to frustration among environmentalists in Minnesota.

Another reason why environmentalists are not excited about DFL's wins is because the DFL has been less supportive of environmental causes in general. For example, the DFL has been less supportive of environmental regulations, and has been more supportive of business interests. This has led to frustration among environmentalists in Minnesota.

Overall, the claim is true because Minnesota environmentalists are not excited about DFL's wins. The DFL has been less supportive of environmental causes in recent years, and this has led to frustration among environmentalists in Minnesota.

18,18,11578,Blood-Pressure Drugs Linked to Birth Defects,"A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that the use of ACE inhibitors, a class of blood-pressure drugs, during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects. The study analyzed data from over 465,000 infants born between 1995 and 2008, and found that the rate of birth defects was nearly tripled in women who had taken ACE inhibitors during the first trimester. The article highlights the risks of using ACE inhibitors during pregnancy, specifically in the first trimester. It mentions that the study did not quantify the possible benefits to the mother for using this drug during pregnancy, but emphasizes that the harms to the fetus are clearly mentioned. However, it fails to mention the risks of not using ACE inhibitors in certain populations, such as women with congestive heart failure or diabetes. The article also discusses the impact of pregnancy on blood pressure, stating that it can either lower or raise blood pressure in women. It notes that ACE inhibitors have been commonly prescribed since the early 1980s and have been used by pregnant women, although the number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but likely small. The story presents the rate of birth defects for women not taking blood pressure medication as 2.6%, while the actual data from the journal article reports a rate of 1.98%. Similarly, the article states that the rate of birth defects for women taking ACE inhibitors during the first trimester is 7.1%, whereas the journal article reports a rate of 8.6%.

It also inaccurately presents the rates of birth defects for women not taking blood pressure medication and those taking ACE inhibitors during the first trimester.",true,"This article reports recent research results that indicate that the use of popular high blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors may, during the first trimester of pregnancy, increase the rate of birth defects from 2.6 per 100 to 7.1 per 100. Although ACE inhibitors have been used for 25 years, the potential risk to human fetuses during the first third of pregnancy had not been explicitly studied. The article would have been improved if it had included the fact that there may also be risks associated with not using ACE inhibitors for some women, such as those with congestive heart failure or diabetes. Overall, this story was very well written and reported.","A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that the use of ACE inhibitors, a class of blood-pressure drugs, during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of birth defects. The study analyzed data from over 465,000 infants born between 1995 and 2008, and found that the rate of birth defects was nearly tripled in women who had taken ACE inhibitors during the first trimester.

The article highlights the risks of using ACE inhibitors during pregnancy, specifically in the first trimester. It mentions that the study did not quantify the possible benefits to the mother for using this drug during pregnancy, but emphasizes that the harms to the fetus are clearly mentioned. However, it fails to mention the risks of not using ACE inhibitors in certain populations, such as women with congestive heart failure or diabetes.

The article also discusses the impact of pregnancy on blood pressure, stating that it can either lower or raise blood pressure in women. It notes that ACE inhibitors have been commonly prescribed since the early 1980s and have been used by pregnant women, although the number of women taking them early in pregnancy is unknown but likely small.

The story presents the rate of birth defects for women not taking blood pressure medication as 2.6%, while the actual data from the journal article reports a rate of 1.98%. Similarly, the article states that the rate of birth defects for women taking ACE inhibitors during the first trimester is 7.1%, whereas the journal article reports a rate of 8.6%. The article fails to mention that the data only pertains to birth defects after ACE inhibitor use during the first trimester.

20,20,8892,Merck Says Thousands File for Vioxx Payments.,"Merck has announced that thousands of people have filed for payments in the program to resolve heart attack and stroke claims related to their arthritis pill, Vioxx. The company withdrew Vioxx from the market in 2004 after research showed that it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who took it for at least 18 months. Over 20 million people in the United States had used the drug, resulting in tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits against Merck. According to Merck, out of the 47,000 people who registered eligible injuries, about 44,000 have submitted the necessary documents to qualify for an interim payment. These payments are part of a settlement agreement reached in November, which requires Merck to meet an 85 percent threshold for receiving enrollment documents in various claims categories. If this threshold is met, Merck will be obligated to pay $4.85 billion in installments into a resolution fund. Merck stated that 5,500 eligible claimants alleging death from heart attack and stroke have initiated enrollment, along with over 26,500 eligible claimants alleging more than 12 months of use. However, the eligibility of another 5,000 claimants who have sought to enroll still needs to be determined. Despite this, Merck expects to meet all enrollment thresholds. To cover the cost of the settlement agreement, Merck recorded a pretax charge of $4.85 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007.

She made the announcement on her Instagram account on April 1, 2020, stating that the donation would go to researchers at Vanderbilt University. Parton mentioned Dr. Naji Abumrad, a professor of surgery at the university's medical center, as a longtime friend who informed her about the bridge treatment they had developed to save lives while waiting for a vaccine. Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) confirmed the donation and explained that their researchers were conducting urgent clinical trials on existing drugs to reduce life-threatening symptoms associated with COVID-19. They were also focusing on developing new therapies to effectively treat and prevent the infection. The goal was to provide a bridge for those infected until a safe and effective vaccine could be developed, which was projected to take 12-18 months. Jeff Balser, MD, PhD, President and CEO of VUMC and Dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, expressed gratitude for Parton's generosity and stated that the funds would support promising research that could benefit millions in their battle against the virus. The news of Parton's involvement in COVID-19 treatment research gained attention on Twitter when journalist Yashar Ali shared a link to a story about vaccine and treatment research, mentioning Parton's name. This tweet was then shared by Ian Hartshorn, a professor at the University of Nevada-Reno, who highlighted Parton's significant contribution compared to other celebrities who had only sung songs on their phones. The article also mentions Parton's involvement with the Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise.

Jeff Balser, MD, PhD, President and CEO of VUMC and Dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, expressed gratitude for Parton's generosity and stated that the funds would support promising research that could benefit millions in their battle against the virus. The news of Parton's involvement in COVID-19 treatment research gained attention on Twitter when journalist Yashar Ali shared a link to a story about vaccine and treatment research, mentioning Parton's name. This tweet was then shared by Ian Hartshorn, a professor at the University of Nevada-Reno, who highlighted Parton's significant contribution compared to other celebrities who had only sung songs on their phones. The article also mentions Parton's involvement with the Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Parton, along with her former manager Sandy Gallin, founded Sandollar Productions, the company that produced both the original Buffy movie and its television adaptation. Although Parton was not mentioned in the end credits, the character Buffy Summers was given Parton's birthday, January 19. In summary, Dolly Parton donated $1 million towards research for COVID-19 treatments at Vanderbilt University. The funds would support urgent clinical trials on existing drugs and the development of new therapies. Parton's involvement gained attention on Twitter, and the article also mentions her connection to the Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise.

Older veterans make up the majority of military suicides, with approximately 65 percent being age 50 or older. The report suggests that the higher suicide rate among veterans in every state may be due to unique problems faced by former service members, such as social isolation, limited healthcare access, gun ownership, and opioid addiction.

27,27,12753,"Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness.","A Florida physician specializing in geriatrics and memory care testified before a Florida Senate committee, warning that Alzheimer's disease is a significant problem for the state. Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, stated that there is currently an epidemic of Alzheimer's disease in Florida, with half a million residents affected. She also projected that within the next 10 years, the number of Floridians with Alzheimer's will increase by 40 percent, resulting in an additional 200,000 cases. Laird's claims were supported by statistics from the ""2017 Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures"" report by the Alzheimer's Association. The report provided estimates for the number of residents with Alzheimer's in each state for 2017 and projected numbers for 2025. For Florida, the report estimated 520,000 cases in 2017 and projected 720,000 cases in 2025, which closely align with Laird's statements. However, it is important to note that these figures are estimates and projections, as indicated in the report. The numbers were derived from a study published in the academic journal Neurology in 2013, which used Alzheimer's diagnosis statistics from 2010 to make future predictions until 2050. Due to the inherent uncertainties and margins of error in estimates and projections, it is an overreach to present these figures as precise numbers of Floridians currently affected by the disease. Laura Cilmi, a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association, confirmed that the numbers are indeed estimates or projections, as stated in the report. While the figures are based on credible scientific research, they should be understood as approximations rather than definitive counts of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, Laird's claim that half a million Floridians currently have Alzheimer's disease and that another 200,000 will develop the illness within the next decade is supported by estimates and projections from a reputable scientific paper. However, it is important to recognize that these numbers are not absolute and should be regarded as approximations.",true,"Laird said, ""Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness.""

For Florida, the report estimated 520,000 cases in 2017 and projected 720,000 cases in 2025, which closely align with Laird's statements.

However, it is important to note that these figures are estimates and projections, as indicated in the report. The numbers were derived from a study published in the academic journal Neurology in 2013, which used Alzheimer's diagnosis statistics from 2010 to make future predictions until 2050. Due to the inherent uncertainties and margins of error in estimates and projections, it is an overreach to present these figures as precise numbers of Floridians currently affected by the disease.

Laura Cilmi, a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association, confirmed that the numbers are indeed estimates or projections, as stated in the report. While the figures are based on credible scientific research, they should be understood as approximations rather than definitive counts of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

In conclusion, Laird's claim that half a million Floridians currently have Alzheimer's disease and that another 200,000 will develop the illness within the next decade is supported by estimates and projections from a reputable scientific paper. However, it is important to recognize that these numbers are not absolute and should be regarded as approximations.","### Instruction:

Context: A Florida physician specializing in geriatrics and memory care testified before a Florida Senate committee, warning that Alzheimer's disease is a significant problem for the state. Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, stated that there is currently an epidemic of Alzheimer's disease in Florida, with half a million residents affected.

After three attempts, the prosthesis was ready and shipped to Haiti, where it was fitted onto Stevenson's left hand by the medical team at Bernard Mevs hospital. The 3-D printed prosthesis is more anatomical and allows for more motion than traditional custom-made prosthetics. It also only costs around $300 to print once the model is designed. Stevenson is now getting used to his new hand and is able to do activities such as playing catch, scoring at basketball, and holding objects like a TV remote and water bottle.

Context: Stevenson Joseph, a Haitian orphan born without fingers on either hand, has received a 3-D printed prosthesis that has given him increased dexterity and the ability to do activities he couldn't do before. In 2010, Stevenson was brought to Bernard Mevs hospital in Port-au-Prince, where an orthopedic team was fitting prosthetic limbs for amputees after an earthquake. However, they were unable to help Stevenson due to his congenital condition. Last year, John Marshall and his wife Lisa met Stevenson at the Little Children of Jesus orphanage in Haiti and decided to help him. They read about Richard van As, a South African man who developed a 3-D printed prosthetic hand called ""Robohand"" after losing his fingers in an accident. Marshall and van As worked together to design a 3-D printed prosthesis for Stevenson. After three attempts, the prosthesis was ready and shipped to Haiti, where it was fitted onto Stevenson's left hand by the medical team at Bernard Mevs hospital. The 3-D printed prosthesis is more anatomical and allows for more motion than traditional custom-made prosthetics. It also only costs around $300 to print once the model is designed. Stevenson is now getting used to his new hand and is able to do activities such as playing catch, scoring at basketball, and holding objects like a TV remote and water bottle. The 3-D device is articulated by Stevenson's wrist and makes a slight creaking plastic sound when moving. Despite some people saying he looks like a robot, Stevenson is happy with his new hand and it has greatly improved his quality of life.

32,32,7422,White House moves toward promoting face masks to fight virus.,"The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus through speaking, as recent information suggests that it can be transmitted even when people are not coughing or sneezing. However, the recommendation is not intended to take away masks from healthcare providers who are in direct contact with infected patients. Medical-grade masks, especially N95 masks, will be reserved for those dealing directly with the sick. President Donald Trump indicated his support for the recommendation, and his latest coronavirus test came back negative. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern that the mask guidance could lead to a false sense of security for Americans. The discussions on face masks occurred as the White House defended its handling of the pandemic and its efforts to distribute ventilators and protective equipment to medical professionals. The White House also considered direct payments to hospitals to cover COVID-19 treatment costs for the uninsured. The emerging guidance on masks is expected to be more limited than a draft from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggested that the recommendation apply to nearly all Americans. The new proposal is driven by research showing that some infections are being spread by seemingly healthy people. Previously, only the sick or those at high risk of complications were advised to wear masks. The CDC recently changed its definition of the risk of infection for Americans, stating that anyone may be considered a carrier, whether or not they have symptoms.

36,36,21520,"Joseph Cryan Says direct shipment of wine ""makes underage drinking as simple as a mouse click.","Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, a Democrat from Union, wrote an op-ed criticizing legislation in the state Senate that would allow direct shipment of wine to New Jersey consumers. Cryan argues that allowing wineries to ship directly to consumers would make underage drinking as simple as a mouse click. He claims that direct shipment provides a virtual store for teens to buy alcohol that they would otherwise be prohibited from buying at liquor stores. Cryan's claim is supported by a 2005 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which states that the internet acts as a general store where teenagers can get hold of almost anything, including alcohol. However, the report does not specifically address underage consumers ordering wine through a licensed winery. Other studies and experts suggest that underage consumers looking for alcohol are unlikely to buy wine. An April report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and a 2006 report by Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse both concluded that wine is not the first choice for underage drinkers. Marilyn Aguirre-Molina, a professor at Columbia University, stated that online purchase of wine is a hassle for teens, as it requires a credit card, an address for delivery, and patience until it arrives. Furthermore, shipping companies like FedEx and UPS require packages containing wine to be labeled as containing alcoholic beverages and require the signature of an adult 21 or older upon delivery.

Emergency supplies had been diverted from Puerto Rico to help victims of Hurricane Irma. Trump's praise for his administration's response to Hurricane Maria drew criticism due to the high number of estimated deaths attributed to the storm. The Milken Institute School of Public Health released a report estimating that there were 2,975 ""excess deaths in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria"" over a six-month period. Trump falsely claimed that the higher death estimate was done by Democrats to make him look bad. The study was an independent study commissioned by Puerto Rico and conducted by researchers at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health. The researchers did an ""excess mortality study"" and estimated that 2,975 excess deaths were related to Hurricane Maria. Trump also misrepresented the study's methodology, claiming it counted deaths ""for any reason, like old age."" The researchers used a state-of-the-art mathematical model to estimate excess deaths, taking into account the usual number of deaths that could be expected during that time period. The 2,975 figure is not an exact count of hurricane-related deaths, but the researchers are 95 percent confident that the number falls between 2,658 and 3,290. Trump ignored the number of indirect hurricane-related deaths that occurred after the storm, as opposed to those directly caused by the storm. The National Hurricane Center also considers indirect deaths and attempts to count them. The death toll in Puerto Rico was initially estimated to be 64 deaths, but the official number was considered too low. The National Hurricane Center stated that there could be hundreds of direct and indirect hurricane-related deaths. Experts agree that the methodology used by the researchers at the Milken Institute School of Public Health was reasonable. The study used tried and true methodologies to estimate the death toll, which will have some uncertainty. The Milken Institute School of Public Health stood by its findings and stated that the number of 2,975 is the most accurate and unbiased estimate of excess mortality to date. It is unclear what Trump meant when he claimed to have successfully raised billions of dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. The federal government has appropriated billions of dollars in disaster relief for Puerto Rico, but the amount falls short of what Puerto Rico estimated it would need to rebuild. Trump's inauguration committee also donated $3 million to hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.
Claim: Said Democrats manufactured a death toll of 3,000 for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to make him ""look as bad as possible.

42,42,9168,Common antibiotic may help to prevent or treat PTSD,"The article discusses a study that suggests a common antibiotic, doxycycline, may be effective in preventing or treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study found that volunteers taking the antibiotic had a 60% lower fear response compared to those who took a placebo. However, the article criticizes the news release for not providing information about the costs of the treatment or the statistical strength of the results. It also points out that the release does not mention the potential side effects and drug interactions associated with the use of doxycycline. The article suggests that more information about the strengths and weaknesses of the research should have been included in the release. It also notes that the release does not provide context about the rate of PTSD in certain populations or other treatment strategies for the condition. The article mentions that another drug, propranolol, has also been studied for its use in blocking fear learning. The release claims novelty in the treatment strategy, but the article argues that other drugs have been identified for this purpose before. Overall, the article criticizes the release for not providing enough information and context about the study and its implications.",false,"This University College London news release describes a complex piece of research that combines cell cultures, human volunteers, a theory that enzymatic proteins called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors are involved in forming threat memories inherent in PTSD, and that a common antibiotic may prevent their formation by blocking the enzymes. The fact that the research was a theoretical proof-of concept is buried deep in the release so readers might think, based on the headline and earlier paragraphs alone, that the evidence is stronger than it is. The published research article describes some of the uncertainties involved in biopsychological investigations in animal models and people, but the release doesn’t mention any of them, nor does it include any meaningful numbers to describe the benefits. It does raise the issue of the practicality of using drugs to prevent PTSD since no one can predict when a traumatic event will occur. The search for the neurochemical and biological roots of PTSD and other kinds of crippling anxieties is a scientific challenge for good reason. The human “mind” is difficult to access; animal models are notoriously unreliable; and experiments on people designed to induce, evoke, or otherwise probe such trauma may be unethical. The work described here may indeed be an important early step in understanding the role of signaling pathways outside of nerve cells in creating PTSD, and of novel strategies using an already widely available set of drugs to sabotage that role. But a lot more research will be needed to affirm the idea and a release on the research should make that point very clear and very high up in the text. When and if the blocking of a conditioned fear response by a drug is proven, who would want to take a long term drug in case a terrible event befalls them in the future? That would be taking “preventive medicine” to a whole new level.","The article discusses a study that suggests a common antibiotic, doxycycline, may be effective in preventing or treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The US had previously threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, but has now agreed to hold off on doing so.

47,47,5700,Hogan announces environmental agreement with dam operator.,"Maryland Governor Larry Hogan has announced an environmental agreement with Exelon, the operator of the Conowingo Dam. The agreement aims to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials are also concerned about sediment buildup behind the dam's walls, which could be released and harm the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The proposed settlement includes $52 million to implement new requirements for flow control in the Lower Susquehanna River, creating more natural conditions. It also includes $41 million to increase efforts to remove trash and debris that flows down the Susquehanna from upstream states. Additionally, $47 million will be allocated for climate resiliency projects, such as submerged aquatic vegetation, clams, oysters, and the restoration of living shorelines. Another $25 million will be used to restore mussels in the Susquehanna. Exelon's president and CEO, Chris Crane, expressed a commitment to restoring and sustaining the health of the Chesapeake Bay, stating that the agreement strengthens this commitment. However, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) expressed concerns that the settlement does not adequately mitigate the negative water quality impact associated with operating the dam. The CBF believes that a majority of the funding should be spent on upstream practices to reduce sediments and pollution reaching the dam. The agreement settles Exelon's legal challenges to the water quality certification issued last year under the Clean Water Act and avoids years of litigation. Exelon has argued that it is unfair to make the company pay for pollution that the dam does not produce. The proposed settlement also includes $500,000 for a study on management options for dredged material. Scientific reports confirm that the dam has reached full capacity and can no longer effectively prevent pollution from entering the Chesapeake Bay, jeopardizing the state's cleanup goals for the estuary.

48,48,9720,Talk Therapy Found to Ease Schizophrenia,"The article discusses a study that found that a combination of talk therapy and medication can be more effective in treating schizophrenia than just medication alone. The study, which was the most rigorous trial of this treatment in the United States, showed that patients who received more one-on-one talk therapy and family counseling made greater strides in recovery over the first two years of treatment compared to patients who received the usual drug-focused care. The drug doses in the therapy group were also 20-50% lower, which is significant considering the side effects of these drugs. The article mentions that the true costs and potential savings of this comprehensive treatment are hard to quantify and would accrue over time as people stay in school and jobs and have fewer hospital admissions. It also highlights that the study's findings have already influenced government agencies, with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services publishing a strong endorsement of the combined-therapy approach in its guidelines. While the article praises the exploration of the political and reimbursement context, it criticizes the lack of specific numbers in the story. It mentions that the study reported that 34% of the therapy group and 37% of the control group had been hospitalized for psychiatric indications over the two years, but it wishes the story had pressed the study authors for more information on this. However, no harms were documented in the study, and on average, the lower doses of medication showed better symptom relief. The article also mentions that mental health reform bills in Congress mention the study by name and that 32 states have begun using block grants to fund combined-treatment services. It notes that while the study followed patients for two years, longer studies would help solidify the results. Overall, the article rates the story as satisfactory, as it provides a sufficient description of the evidence and does not engage in disease mongering. It also includes quotes from experts who were not authors on the study and explains the two alternatives being compared in the research. The article concludes by stating that the story shows original reporting and does not rely on a news release.",true,"Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. “Though it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,” the correction notes.”Therefore, the study did not conclude ‘that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.’ (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes. )” We changed the headline of our review from “Times captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment” to “Times explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.” The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers. In a large randomized controlled trial in 34 community clinics across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better. The story overall does a solid job of covering the study and its implications. But we wish it had pushed a bit harder to quantify the benefits shown in the 2-year trial with some hard numbers. We applaud the discussion of federal policy and financing, but also wish there had been some discussion of the costs of therapy itself. The inclusion of a variety of perspectives on the research brings depth and nuance to the coverage. Psychiatric treatment in the U.S. has become very drug focused. Other countries are ahead of us on using more integrated care models like the one described in this story, so it’s great to see its success “proven” with a randomized trial. With solid evidence to back it, this model will hopefully become a more accepted approach to practice in the U.S.","The article discusses a study that found that a combination of talk therapy and medication can be more effective in treating schizophrenia than just medication alone.

49,49,12671,Autopsy results from Vince Foster’s exhumed body — Cause of death to be changed!,"The article in question is a fake news story claiming that former White House counsel Vince Foster's body has been exhumed and that the cause of his death will be changed. The story was posted on Liberty-Courier.com, a website known for publishing fake news stories. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially fake, and it has also appeared on other fake news websites. Vince Foster, who was deputy counsel to President Bill Clinton, committed suicide in 1993 at the age of 48. Conspiracy theories have circulated for years suggesting that Foster was killed by the Clintons due to his knowledge of the Whitewater real estate deal or other insights. President Donald Trump has also questioned whether Foster's death was a suicide, despite multiple investigations concluding that it was. The fake news story claims that U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy ordered Foster's body to be exhumed and that the forensics lab at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia determined that Foster suffered two gunshot wounds, suggesting his death should be reclassified as a homicide. However, Foster's body has not been exhumed, and there is no Naval Hospital in Norfolk. The photo accompanying the story, which supposedly shows naval forensics specialists, is actually a handout photo from the Sacramento County Coroner's Office. The fake news story originated from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website known for publishing fake news stories. While the website does not explicitly state that its stories are fake, its ""About Us"" section notes that all articles should be considered satirical and any quotes attributed to actual people are ""complete and total baloney.""

50,50,2835,Smoking to kill 5.6 million US kids if not stubbed out: report.,"A new report by the Surgeon General has found that smoking has killed over 20 million Americans prematurely in the last 50 years. Although adult smoking rates have decreased, with only 18% of Americans currently smoking compared to 43% in 1965, the report highlights that more needs to be done to eliminate smoking. Each day, over 3,200 youths under the age of 18 try their first cigarette. The report calls for businesses, state and local governments, and society as a whole to take action to end smoking within a generation. The report details the various diseases and health conditions caused by smoking, including liver and colorectal cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired immune function, and cleft palate in infants. It also highlights that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent. The report estimates that smoking costs the nation $130 billion in direct medical expenses each year. The tobacco industry is criticized for its continued efforts to promote their products, with the report noting that the industry spends $8 billion each year on advertising and marketing. The report calls for public health officials to take tougher action to curb tobacco use. It also urges states to increase their investment in smoking prevention, as currently, they only spend about $1.50 per person on tobacco control, despite receiving $80 per capita from tobacco companies related to a major legal settlement in 1998. The report briefly touches on the topic of electronic cigarettes, expressing concerns about their use as smoking cessation tools and their potential to introduce more people to nicotine. Health groups and state attorneys general have been pressuring the FDA to impose regulations on e-cigarettes.

52,52,2564,U.S. teen smoking declines to record low in 2012: study.,"According to an annual survey of about 45,000 students in the eighth, 10th, and 12th grades, the proportion of students who reported smoking in the prior 30 days fell by just over a percentage point to 10.6 percent. This represents a 9 percent reduction in the number of teens currently smoking in a single year. The researchers believe that this decline can lead to the prevention of thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of cases of cancer and other serious diseases. The survey also found that smoking rates fell for each of the individual age groups surveyed, with the most significant decline among eighth graders. The proportion of eighth graders who had tried cigarettes dropped from nearly half in 1996 to just 16 percent in 2012. Teen attitudes toward smoking also became more negative, with 80 percent of teens saying they preferred to date nonsmokers in 2012. The researchers attribute the decline in teen smoking rates to higher cigarette taxes, federal curbs on youth-oriented tobacco marketing and sales, and a sweeping anti-smoking media campaign. The increase in federal cigarette taxes, raised by 62 cents a pack in 2009, is seen as a likely contributing factor. However, the battle to stamp out teen smoking is far from over, as 17 percent of high school seniors still graduate as smokers. The researchers also expressed concerns over new forms of smokeless tobacco, such as dissolvable products like Camel-branded “Orbs” and “Strips,” as well as small cigars and water pipes called hookahs, which are becoming popular among young adults. The tobacco industry still spends $8.5 billion a year to market its products, and anti-tobacco advocates believe that more needs to be done to prevent youth from being enticed by these deadly and addictive products.",true,"Cigarette smoking among American teenagers dropped to a record low in 2012, a decline that may have been partly driven by a sharp hike in the federal tobacco tax, researchers said on Wednesday.","According to an annual survey of about 45,000 students in the eighth, 10th, and 12th grades, the proportion of students who reported smoking in the prior 30 days fell by just over a percentage point to 10.6 percent.

55,55,25853,“Florida is doing over five times better” than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people.,"The claim that Florida is doing over five times better than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people is misleading. While it is true that Florida's death rate is lower than that of New Jersey and New York, there are important factors to consider. According to an epidemiologist, the metric of COVID-19 deaths per million people is time-sensitive and difficult to interpret without proper context. The true denominator, which is the number of people infected, is unknown, and it is impossible to predict the future course of the outbreak. The Facebook post that made the claim cited data from Worldometer, which showed that Florida's death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey's and New York's. Other databases, including one from Johns Hopkins University, also confirmed this finding. However, this measure is limited because it only focuses on a state that became a hotspot after New York and New Jersey. News reports before the Facebook post highlighted Florida's record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases. The state had the highest single-day total of new cases and the highest weekly death total during the outbreak. A federal report also classified Florida as one of the 21 states in the ""red zone"" due to serious outbreaks. To provide a larger perspective, among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people. This statistic, according to Johns Hopkins University, places the US behind the United Kingdom, Peru, and Chile. Timing is a crucial factor in understanding the misleading nature of the claim. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, while Florida experienced its surge later. Experts argue that it is necessary to wait until the outbreak is over to accurately assess how well states have handled the situation. As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared to 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York. However, death counts and rates are lagging indicators and cannot predict the future course of the outbreak.

56,56,14726,"Hillary Clinton Says Bernie Sanders ""has reversed his position on immunity"" for gun manufacturers and sellers.","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accused Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders of flip-flopping on his position regarding immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers. Clinton has been criticizing Sanders for his vote on a 2005 bill that provided significant protection against lawsuits for gun makers, sellers, and trade associations. Sanders, who represents a rural state where guns are widely accepted, has sometimes sided with advocates of gun rights and sometimes with supporters of gun control. One of the examples where Sanders broke with Democrats is in supporting the gun liability bill in 2005. Clinton called on Sanders to admit that he got it wrong in a recent interview. Sanders responded by releasing a statement saying that he supports proposals to rescind portions of the 2005 law and tighten it up. Clinton portrayed this as a flip-flop during a debate, but Sanders' campaign manager disagreed, saying that it was consistent with Sanders' previous position. The bill in question includes provisions for broad-based immunity for gun sellers, but it also has exceptions for cases involving violent crimes, negligence, and physical defects with the weapon. Sanders and his campaign have expressed comfort with his past vote on the bill, but he has also said that he would be open to reconsidering it. In a recent news release, Sanders expressed support for a proposal to rescind the liability portions of the 2005 law, while keeping the trigger-lock and armor-piercing-ammunition provisions intact. He also stated that he would propose an amendment to require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the law's impact in rural areas. Clinton's claim that Sanders has reversed his position on immunity for gun manufacturers and sellers is accurate, as Sanders' position has evolved over time.

Sanders voted for the 2005 measure that provided broad liability exclusions for gunmakers and sellers. After months of Sanders and his staff defending the vote, Sanders’ position started to evolve in October. Sanders’ position three months ago -- that he would ""take another look"" at the liability question -- is consistent with his Jan. 16 news release saying he supported a proposal to rescind the immunity provisions. But to look back only to October doesn’t tell the full story, ignoring not only the 2003 and 2005 votes but also several instances in which Sanders or his staff defended those votes in interviews between June 2015 and early January 2016.

Sanders initially defended his vote on the 2005 bill, which provided significant protection against lawsuits for gun makers, sellers, and trade associations.

60,60,377,Quebec appeals court upholds C$15 billion tobacco class action ruling.,"The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld a C$15 billion ($11.3 billion) judgment against three major tobacco companies in Canada. The judgment involves class action suits that were consolidated against the Canadian subsidiaries of British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, and Japan Tobacco International. The companies were appealing a 2015 Quebec Superior Court ruling that awarded damages to around 100,000 Quebec smokers and ex-smokers who claimed that the companies knew since the 1950s that their products were causing cancer and other illnesses but failed to adequately warn consumers. The judgment is considered a ""huge defeat"" for the tobacco industry, according to Rob Cunningham from the Canadian Cancer Society. The companies are expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The judgment comes at a time when tobacco companies are investing heavily in vaping devices that they claim are less harmful than traditional smoking. The two Quebec suits, known as the Letourneau and Blais cases, were filed in 1998 and certified as class actions in 2005. The cases were consolidated into one before the trial proceedings began in 2012 and concluded in 2014. The companies involved in the case expressed disappointment with the decision and stated that they fundamentally disagree with the court's judgment.

Furthermore, the article states that Assange currently resides at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and is wanted by Swedish authorities over allegations of sexual assault, so a pardon from the US president would not necessarily resolve his legal troubles. This indicates that Assange is not in a position to negotiate a pardon with the US president and that his primary concern is avoiding prosecution for his actions. Additionally, the article discusses the legality of WikiLeaks' actions and states that generally publishing classified information is not a crime in the United States, except for specific cases such as nuclear secrets, identities of covert agents, and certain forms of communications intelligence. This suggests that WikiLeaks' actions are not necessarily illegal and that Assange would not need to seek a pardon for his actions. Furthermore, the article mentions that the word ""communicates"" in the relevant section of the Espionage Act was never meant to encompass publication or affect the press. This indicates that WikiLeaks' actions are not necessarily illegal and that Assange would not need to seek a pardon for his actions"

64,64,2633,France's 20th century radium craze still haunts Paris.,"The article discusses the lingering effects of the radium craze that occurred in Paris in the 20th century. After Marie Curie discovered radium in 1898, Parisians became obsessed with the luminescent metal and started using it in various products. However, the companies that manufactured these products have since gone out of business, leaving small doses of radium between the cracks of some Parisian parquet floors. While prolonged exposure to these small doses of radium could be toxic, officials claim that they do not pose serious health risks. France's national agency for radioactive waste, ANDRA, has identified around 130 sites in France suspected of being at risk, with 40 of them set for decontamination, half of which are in the Paris area. The clean-up efforts are being undertaken as a precautionary measure under a recent French law. The article highlights a two-storey house in Chaville, a suburb of Paris, where masked men in hazmat suits are drilling holes in the wooden floors. This house used to be an aircraft altimeter factory, and the workers used radium powder and zinc sulphide to color the dials with glow-in-the-dark paint. Traces of the paint are still present in the wooden floor, garden, and basement, but they are too small to present a risk. However, they still need to be collected and sent to ANDRA's nuclear waste storage sites. The decontamination cost for a house like this is 260,000 euros, and ANDRA has a 4 million euro annual budget for decontamination. Some sites that are deemed too contaminated to make renovation cost-effective have been bought by ANDRA and razed. The article also mentions the case of the Jersyk family, whose former house in Gif-sur-Yvette was part of an estate built near a disused factory where radium needles for hospitals were manufactured. The family experienced health issues, and abnormal levels of radium and radon gas were found in their house. It took them 30 years to relocate, and their complaint was dismissed by a court.

While Clinton's statement is not perfectly accurate, it is close. The claim refers to the achievements of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a State Department program that aims to get as many people as possible into HIV/AIDS treatment, primarily in Africa. PEPFAR started under President George W. Bush, and President Barack Obama continued it. Hillary Clinton can take some credit for PEPFAR's achievements as it is a State Department program. The number of people in treatment rose from 2.1 million at the end of 2008 to 5.1 million by the end of 2012, more than doubling but not quite tripling as Clinton stated. However, this increase did come without additional tax dollars. Treatment spending fell dramatically for two years and then returned to the 2009 level, delivering about 250 percent more treatment with the same amount of money. The cost per patient was also significantly reduced during Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, from $673 to $338. This was achieved through the shift to generic drugs and cost-cutting measures such as using land and sea transportation instead of air delivery. While not all of the work is done by State Department agencies, the secretary of state sets the priorities, and in this case, the priority was to expand treatment at a lower cost per person.

They have made significant progress on several key issues, including climate change, immigration, and road repairs. One major achievement was the reauthorization of California's cap-and-trade program, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program, which puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits, received bipartisan support but faced criticism from environmental justice groups who believed it was too generous to oil companies. Lawmakers also voted to spend $1.5 billion of the revenue generated from the program on initiatives to reduce pollution, such as electric vehicle rebates and cleaner trucks and buses. In terms of road repairs, lawmakers approved a gas tax increase that is expected to generate $5 billion per year. The tax increase will be phased in over time, with gas prices rising by 12 cents per gallon in November and 19.5 cents by 2020. The money from the tax increase will primarily be used for road repairs, although some funds will also go towards transit, parks, and other projects. The tax increase has become a contentious issue, with Republicans attempting to recall Democratic Sen. Josh Newman, who supported it. On the healthcare front, a proposal to provide universal health coverage for Californians did not move forward this year. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon shelved the plan, citing its lack of a funding plan. However, Rendon has formed a special committee to explore universal health coverage. In the meantime, the Legislature did pass a drug-price transparency bill that requires pharmaceutical companies to provide advance notice before instituting large price increases. In terms of law enforcement, lawmakers failed to act on changing the money bail system, but","California legislators have been focusing on climate, immigration, and roads this year.

68,68,2409,New York City Council votes to add e-cigarettes to smoking ban.,"The New York City Council has voted to add electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, to the city's Smoke-Free Air Act. If the mayor signs the bill, smoking e-cigarettes, also known as ""vaping,"" would be prohibited in public and private venues such as beaches, parks, restaurants, and office buildings. The bill was sponsored by City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who believes that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine anti-smoking laws. E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in various flavors. When a user puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that does not contain tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law argue that the ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a board member at NJOY, one of America's largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council urging them to reject the bill. Carmona expressed concern that including e-cigarettes in the smoking ban could be a setback in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking. The debate over the risks versus benefits of e-cigarettes is ongoing, but a recent study published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, found that they are as effective as nicotine patches for smokers trying to quit.

69,69,7847,"Black women's hair loss tied to braiding, weaving: study.","A study conducted by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio found a high prevalence of central hair loss among African American women. The study, published in the Archives of Dermatology, surveyed 326 African American women and examined their scalps. It found that nearly all of the women straightened their curls chemically and about one in six had scarring hair loss. More than half of the women with scarring hair loss reported having braids, weaves, or hair extensions, compared to only a third of those with less severe hair loss. However, the study could not definitively prove that hair grooming was the cause of the hair loss. The researchers also discovered that women with type 2 diabetes were more likely to have scarring hair loss, as were those with bacterial scalp infections. This suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the balding. The lead researcher, Angela Kyei, emphasized that hair grooming should not be the only factor considered when examining patients with hair loss. The study's findings highlight the potential link between prolonged pulling at hair strands and inflammation of the hair follicle, which can lead to scarring. This scarring can result in scarring hair loss or central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, a type of balding that starts at the top of the scalp and spreads slowly to the rest.

70,70,7306,Troubled Texas anti-abortion group seeks federal grant money.,"The Round Rock-based Heidi Group, along with two other Texas health providers, has applied for grant funding under the federal Department of Health and Human Services' Title X program. The program provides family-planning services to low-income individuals for free or at low cost. The collaborative funding application proposes that the grant money be managed by the Obria Group, a Catholic organization that aims to become an alternative to Planned Parenthood. The group has requested nearly $8 million annually for three years, with medical duties split among the three health providers to serve about 15,000 patients each year. Obria has previously been denied Title X funding due to its opposition to the use of condoms and other forms of birth control. If approved, the Obria Group could expand significantly in Texas, which has the highest rate of uninsured residents in the country. There are approximately 1.8 million women in Texas in need of publicly-funded family planning services. This funding would also help the Heidi Group recover after being cut off by Texas health officials last year. The Heidi Group was hired in 2016 to strengthen small clinics that provide women's health services but do not offer abortions. However, an investigation by The Associated Press in 2017 revealed that the group did not come close to serving the promised 50,000 women. As a result, Texas cancelled $6 million in contracts and is investigating over $1 million in billings. The Heidi Group's founder, Carol Everett, stated in a letter submitted with the grant application that their involvement would significantly improve the availability and access to these services. Texas currently receives about $13 million annually from the Title X program, which is facing a lawsuit from two groups seeking to block a new rule that would prohibit family planning clinics funded by Title X from making abortion referrals. Obria is competing for funding with the Women's Health and Family Planning Association of Texas, which served 195,000 patients last year.

73,73,10562,The trouble with mammograms,"The article titled ""The trouble with mammograms"" discusses the potential drawbacks and limitations of mammography as a screening tool for breast cancer. It highlights the fact that mass screening can lead to overtreatment and unnecessary treatment for some women. The article also mentions the significant cost implications of these treatments, which amount to around $10 billion annually for screening and another $10 billion annually for treatment. The article emphasizes the importance of presenting key numbers such as the number needed to test (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH). These numbers help to understand how many women need to be screened regularly to save one life and how many women may receive unnecessary treatments. The article also mentions that 22% of cancers might regress on their own, which is an important consideration for women when deciding on their personal mammography screening schedule or whether to screen for breast cancer at all. The discomfort and potential harms of mammography are discussed, including finding benign lesions and overtreatment for less aggressive cancers. However, the article does not mention the anxiety many women face before and after screening, especially if a mammogram is positive. It also highlights the high false positive rate of mammography, which is about 50% over 10 years. The article praises the design of the BMJ study and evidence from a recent Cochrane review of breast cancer screening. It presents this new information in the context of similar analyses that have found screening to be overvalued for saving lives. The article does not engage in disease mongering but instead discusses lower-risk forms of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions that may not require treatment. The article includes perspectives from expert epidemiologists, clinicians, breast cancer survivors, and advocates. It questions the value of screening for some women and presents a balanced view by citing both a pro-screening advocate and a clinician who gives a tempered response to the latest data. The article also raises the option that some women may choose not to have regular mammograms, which is not often discussed in news stories. While the article does not rely on a press release for information, it provides interpretation of medical studies and independent reporting from various clinical experts and breast cancer advocacy groups. However, it could have further discussed the role of patients in decision-making and the importance of shared decision-making between patients and caregivers. Overall, the article focuses on the limitations and potential harms of mammograms, presenting evidence that challenges the belief that more screening will save lives. It highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to breast cancer screening and encourages women to consider their personal circumstances when making screening decisions.",true,"The idea that screening may be harmful is not often discussed in news stories. The story nicely presents this seemingly counter-intuitive point that finding more cancer may not save lives; however, the story could have discussed the role patients can play in deciding whether or not to get screened and how they could discuss this decision with physicians, who may be strong advocates for screening. The story does not mention that women could discuss an individualized screening schedule with their physician. Some women at higher-risk of breast cancer may be better candidates for annual screening between age 40-50 (or earlier, depending on family history or genetic markers), while others may not wish to screen until they are in their 50s or 60s. The story does not mention how physicians could counsel anxious patients on the true value of screening for breast cancer. The story does note that mass screening results in overtreatment and possibly unnecessary treatment for some women; however, the cost implications for such treatments are not discussed, an important omission at this time in the development of U.S. healthcare policy and physician reimbursements for screening. The story superbly cites expert epidemiologists and clinicians who discuss the problems with overselling mammograms and how this flies in the face of public health campaigns and U.S. clinical guidelines that women over 40 get annual mammograms. The story also cites a breast cancer survivor and advocate who questions the value of screening for some women. An advocate from a pro-screening group is also cited and her message is balanced by a clinician (who consults with the organization) who gives a tempered response to the latest data that screening may not benefit, and may even harm, women who are not at high-risk of developing aggressive breast cancer.","The article titled ""The trouble with mammograms"" discusses the potential drawbacks and limitations of mammography as a screening tool for breast cancer.

The Health Ministry stated that these steps were precautionary and aimed at raising the health sector's readiness to control the virus if detected. In addition to these measures, the Syrian government postponed parliamentary elections previously scheduled for April 13 to May 20. The top religious council also suspended Friday prayers at mosques until April 4. The government denied allegations made by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that cases of the virus had been detected in Damascus and other provinces but were being concealed. Education Minister al-Azab stated that it was not possible for the government or the Ministry of Health to cover up a disease, as it would be difficult to hide its spread. Pakistani health officials reported that at least five cases in their country originated from patients traveling from Syria via Qatar. It is unclear whether the infections originated in Qatar, where the number of cases has risen to 337, the highest among Gulf Arab states. Syria, along with Libya and Yemen, is one of the three countries in the Middle East that have not yet announced a confirmed coronavirus case. These countries could face significant challenges in containing an outbreak due to the impact of years of war on their healthcare systems. Syria had already suspended flights to and from several countries affected by the virus, including Iran, with which it has close ties. Overall, the Syrian government is taking broad steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the country. They have implemented various measures such as school closures, event cancellations, reduced staffing in public institutions, and the postponement of elections. The government denies allegations of concealing infections and emphasizes the difficulty of hiding the spread of a disease. However, there are concerns about the potential challenges Syria may face in containing an outbreak due to the impact of the ongoing war on its healthcare system.

Non-communicable diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and heart and lung disease, account for almost 80 percent of all deaths worldwide and are the leading cause of premature death in developing countries.

Bloomberg's appointment is expected to strengthen WHO's response to these major public health challenges. Effective strategies to prevent non-communicable diseases include increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol, enforcing smoke-free environments, promoting healthy diets, and discouraging the consumption of sugary, salty, and fatty foods. Proven actions to prevent injuries include wearing seat belts and helmets, enforcing speed limits, implementing drink-driving legislation, and enforcing laws on smoke alarms and hot water temperatures. Bloomberg has a history of taking steps to improve public health, such as raising cigarette prices, banning trans fats, and attempting to limit the size of sodas during his tenure as mayor of New York City. His philanthropic investments in public health include commitments to eradicate polio, reduce global tobacco use, and tackle obesity, road safety, maternal health, and drowning.

82,82,2945,"Six new cases of MERS virus hit Saudi Arabia, UAE.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported six new cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These new infections bring the total number of confirmed cases to 176, with 74 deaths. MERS, which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, is from the same family as the SARS virus and can cause coughing, fever, and pneumonia. The high death rate of over 40% among confirmed cases and the spread of the virus beyond the Middle East has raised concerns among scientists and public health officials. The new cases include one fatal case in a 73-year-old Saudi man and three cases in Saudi health workers who showed no adverse symptoms. In the UAE, a 59-year-old woman, the wife of a previously infected man, has been confirmed as a new case. Although she has no adverse symptoms, she is currently in isolation in the hospital. Scientists are increasingly focused on a possible link between human infections and camels as a potential ""animal reservoir"" of the virus. Recent research by Dutch and Qatari scientists has shown that MERS can infect camels, strengthening suspicions that these animals may be a source of the human outbreak. Camels are commonly used in the region for meat, milk, transport, and racing. The WHO advises people at high risk of severe disease due to MERS to avoid close contact with animals in areas where the virus is known to be circulating.

However, every investigation into Foster's death has found that he shot himself once in the mouth with his own handgun. Foster's suicide was attributed to his distress over accusations of malfeasance involving the White House Travel Office, and he had sought treatment for depression prior to his death.

However, the article states that the source of this information is an anonymous DEA lawyer, which raises doubts about its credibility. The article also highlights that reputable journalists rarely use anonymous sources as the sole source of information. The article goes on to mention that the DEA has previously rejected a rescheduling petition for marijuana in 2011, stating that the known risks of marijuana use have not been outweighed by specific benefits in well-controlled clinical trials. However, the DEA has acknowledged that they intend to respond to a five-year-old rescheduling petition by July 1, 2016. The article also discusses the potential implications of rescheduling marijuana. If marijuana becomes a Schedule 2 drug, it would be subject to intense inspections and testing by the FDA. The article suggests that this could open the door for big pharmaceutical companies to enter the industry. However, it also notes that the existing cannabis industry may not benefit from rescheduling, as it would still be subject to other laws and regulations.

The article concludes by mentioning that if marijuana is rescheduled for medical/prescription use but the recreational side is shut down, states would lose tax revenues and marijuana-related jobs. It also mentions that the DEA announced in August 2016 that they had declined two rescheduling petitions, stating that marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance. In summary, the claim that the DEA will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016 is false. The article highlights the lack of credibility of the anonymous source and mentions that the DEA has previously rejected rescheduling petitions. The article also discusses the potential implications of rescheduling marijuana and the potential negative consequences for states.
Claim: The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016.
The claim veracity: false

The claim that the DEA will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016 is false. The article explains that rumors began circulating on social media in mid-June 2016, claiming that the DEA would be legalizing marijuana by moving it from Schedule 1 to Schedule 2 classification. However, the article states that the source of this information is an anonymous DEA lawyer, which raises doubts about its credibility. Additionally, the article highlights that reputable journalists rarely use anonymous sources as the sole source of information. Furthermore, the article mentions that the DEA has previously rejected a rescheduling petition for marijuana in 2011, stating that the known risks of marijuana use have not been outweighed by specific benefits in well-controlled clinical trials. In summary, the claim that the DEA will be reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug in August 2016 is false.

The cost of the pill is not mentioned, but similar pills on the market have a retail price of approximately $10 per pill or $300 per month. The study aimed to achieve a target blood pressure below 140/90, and the results showed that 70% of subjects reached this target with the triple pill compared to just over half receiving normal care. However, it is important to note that the study only measured blood pressure after 6 months, and the effect on cardiovascular risk reduction is unknown. The article also mentions the side effects reported in the study, which include dizziness and fainting in the triple pill group. Combination antihypertensive medications can have major drug interactions and cause swelling and metabolic disturbances. The study design included 700 patients randomized to receive either the triple pill or usual care, with an average patient age of 56 years old and a mean baseline blood pressure of 154/90. The difference in systolic blood pressure achieved by the triple pill group compared to the usual care group was only 9 mm of mercury, which may not be clinically significant at the individual level.

But there’s plenty of room for improvement here including: presenting the findings in a more meaningful context for patients, including the substantial adverse outcomes noted by the researchers, and using much more toned down language for results that are neither novel or all that significant. Notably, there is a significant financial conflict of interest involving the authors. This should have been made clear to readers. The global importance of poorly controlled high blood pressure is well-stated by the authors in the introduction to their study published in JAMA (paraphrased): High blood pressure is the leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease globally with most of the disease burden occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The availability and affordability of medications is a critical issue. About one-third of individuals with high blood pressure in these settings receive treatment. Only about half of patients treated in high-income countries and about 1-in-4 patients in low- and middle-income countries achieve blood pressure control. A fixed low-dose combination therapy with inexpensive blood pressure-lowering drugs has the potential to address several barriers to improve blood pressure control worldwide. Indeed, there’s significant need for a simple-to-take, effective, and affordable medication to address this issue. If successful, the benefits to patients, and the profits for developers, would be massive.","The article discusses a study on a new triple pill that combines three different medications to lower blood pressure.

96,96,8211,"In Nagoya, scramble for hospital beds shows coronavirus challenge for aging Japan.","Japan is facing challenges in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak due to its aging population and limited hospital capacity. While the country has closed schools and canceled public events to prevent the spread of the virus, the lack of widespread testing has led some medical experts to believe that the extent of infection is understated. This raises concerns that a surge in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system. Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, is particularly affected, with 98 confirmed cases and only 27 beds available for coronavirus patients. Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp, is the second-hardest hit prefecture in Japan, with 121 confirmed cases. The prefecture has a total of 161 beds capable of handling such patients, and 105 of them are already in use. The elderly population in Japan is especially vulnerable to the virus, as the country has the world's oldest population, with over 28% aged 65 or over. Experts warn that if the epidemic continues, Japan could face a situation similar to Italy, which is struggling to cope with the increasing number of cases. To address the shortage of hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgeries may be asked to wait, and those with milder symptoms may be asked to isolate at home. Hospitals are also preparing plans to transfer patients to facilities that can treat them. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stated that there are 12,000 beds nationwide that can accommodate serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators. However, experts argue that there may not be enough trained medical staff to handle all of these cases.

While the country has closed schools and canceled public events to prevent the spread of the virus, the lack of widespread testing has led some medical experts to believe that the extent of infection is understated. This raises concerns that a surge in cases could overwhelm the healthcare system.

Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, is particularly affected, with 98 confirmed cases and only 27 beds available for coronavirus patients. Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp, is the second-hardest hit prefecture in Japan, with 121 confirmed cases. The prefecture has a total of 161 beds capable of handling such patients, and 105 of them are already in use.

The elderly population in Japan is especially vulnerable to the virus, as the country has the world's oldest population, with over 28% aged 65 or over. Experts warn that if the epidemic continues, Japan could face a situation similar to Italy, which is struggling to cope with the increasing number of cases.

To address the shortage of hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgeries may be asked to wait, and those with milder symptoms may be asked to isolate at home. Hospitals are also preparing plans to transfer patients to facilities that can treat them.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stated that there are 12,000 beds nationwide that can accommodate serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators. However, experts argue that there may not be enough trained medical staff to handle all of these cases.

The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)","The article discusses a study that investigated the clinical usefulness of additional genetic panels for breast cancer testing, beyond the routine BRCA1/2 tests.
