0,295,WHO recommends one-hour maximum screen time per day for under-5s.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life. The WHO advises that children between the ages of one and four should spend at least three hours participating in various physical activities throughout the day. Infants under one should engage in floor-based play and avoid all screens. The organization warns against excessive use of electronic screens with young children. The WHO emphasizes that preventing obesity and related diseases should start in early life, as being inactive contributes to the rising numbers of overweight and obese individuals worldwide. Currently, 40 million children under the age of five are overweight, with 50 percent of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. This translates to 5.9 percent of children globally. The WHO guidelines are based on evidence from numerous studies, many of which were conducted in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. The organization highlights that sedentary behaviors, such as using motorized transport instead of walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, and playing inactive screen-based games, are associated with poor health outcomes. Chronic insufficient sleep in children has also been linked to increased fat accumulation. Shorter sleep duration is often associated with more screen time and playing computer games. The WHO's guidelines aim to promote healthy habits and lifestyle routines during early childhood, a period of rapid physical and cognitive development. The organization stresses the importance of addressing these issues early on to prevent premature death from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain forms of cancer.",true,"Young children should not spend more than an hour a day watching television and videos or playing computer games and infants less than one year old should not be exposed to electronic screens at all, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging in children. The drug, called Zokinvy, is the first FDA-approved treatment for progeria and a related condition called progeroid laminopathy. Progeria is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, with symptoms such as hair loss, joint stiffness, and heart disease. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. The mutation leads to the production of an abnormal form of lamin A called progerin, which causes cells to age prematurely. Zokinvy, developed by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, works by blocking the production of progerin. The drug was tested in a clinical trial involving 62 children with progeria, and the results showed that it was effective in slowing the progression of the disorder. The FDA's approval of Zokinvy is a significant step forward in the treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathy, and it is hoped that the drug will improve the quality of life for children with these conditions.

1,11286,Stem cell experiment lets diabetics forgo insulin,"A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years. The main finding of the research is that the experimental treatment seems to cure diabetes in these patients. However, the broadcast fails to mention the cost of the procedure or project any potential costs. It does highlight the potential dangers of the procedure, such as infections resulting from the suppression of the immune system. The broadcast does not mention the possibility that the remarkable findings could be due to chance or bias, as pointed out by the researchers themselves. The findings will need to be validated through randomized studies that compare the new treatment to standard care or a placebo, and follow patients for a longer period of time. The broadcast does not explain this. There is no evidence of disease-mongering in the broadcast, as it presents a balanced view from cautious researchers, an academic ethicist, and a mother of a child with Type I diabetes. The broadcast also highlights the current standard of care for Type I diabetes, which involves insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It shows a young girl managing her disease through this routine, illustrating the hardships and discipline required. The broadcast emphasizes that the stem cell therapy is experimental and not widely available. While the broadcast suggests that this form of stem cell therapy is new, similar treatments for Type I diabetes have been experimented with since the 1990s. There is no obvious use of text from a press release in the broadcast.",true,"The NBC broadcast nicely contrasts the demands that glucose monitoring and insulin shots impose on Type I diabetes patients with the tremendous uncertainty associated with experimental stem cell treatments that might free patients from these daily routines. It summarizes the treatment’s apparent benefits and potential harms, as well as ethical concerns about exporting research on dangerous treatments to countries such as Brazil where patients may not fully understand the risks. If the broadcast has a weakness, it is that it fails to mention the limitations inherent in any small, nonrandomized, nonblinded study with short follow-up that investigates a new treatment in patients with a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. (See “Evidence” above.) Even if the treatments were relatively safe and conducted in the U.S., viewers should understand that such studies are awash in potential biases and should always be approached with caution.","A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: A recent study suggests that a special type of MRI could potentially be used to diagnose autism. The study found that there were differences in brain activity between typical children and children with autism in the language comprehension area. However, the article notes that these differences may not be exclusive to autism and that a larger study group may have included subjects with similar brain activity who were not diagnosed as autistic. The article also mentions that there are no quantified or mentioned harms associated with an inaccurate diagnosis of autism. The limitations of the study are acknowledged, such as the fact that it was conducted on school-aged children and that it is unknown if the same differences in neuroimaging would be found in younger patients. The article emphasizes that the technique of using MRIs to diagnose autism is unproven and not widely applicable. The expertise of the radiologist is also mentioned as a factor in the validity of the testing. The article concludes that there is still much work to be done before MRIs can be used as a screening device for autism.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government is planning to release genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida is false. The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) has been working with the biotechnology company Oxitec to develop a genetically modified mosquito that can help control the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are known to transmit diseases such as Zika, dengue, and yellow fever. The genetically modified mosquitoes are male and do not bite, so they pose no risk to humans. They are designed to mate with female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and produce offspring that will die before reaching adulthood, thus reducing the population of disease-carrying mosquitoes. The FKMCD and Oxitec have been conducting field trials of the genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys since 2016, and the results have been promising. The trials have shown that the genetically modified mosquitoes can effectively reduce the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes by up to 90%. However, the FKMCD and Oxitec have not yet received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to release the genetically modified mosquitoes on a larger scale. The EPA is currently reviewing the data from the field trials and will make a decision on whether to approve the release of the"

6,8780,New antibody drug helps cells kill blood cancer.,"A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer. In a Phase I trial, all seven patients who received the highest dose of blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The drug works by binding cancer cells to cytotoxic T-cells, allowing them to effectively kill the tumor without causing uncontrolled T-cell activity. This is a significant breakthrough as scientists have struggled to find a way to trigger a T-cell attack against tumors. Micromet Inc, the company developing blinatumomab, hopes to conduct a pivotal clinical trial next year to gain regulatory approval. The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL. Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue. Overall, the results of the Phase I trial for blinatumomab in NHL are promising and provide hope for patients with previously incurable blood cancer.

Context: A new study has found that the use of a drug called ""buprenorphine"" can help reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose. The study, published in the journal Addiction, looked at data from over 17,000 people who were prescribed buprenorphine for opioid addiction. The researchers found that those who were prescribed the drug were less likely to die from an opioid overdose than those who were not prescribed the drug. The study also found that the risk of death from opioid overdose was lower for those who were prescribed buprenorphine for longer periods of time. The researchers believe that the drug may help to reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose by reducing the cravings for opioids and by helping to prevent relapse. The study's lead author, Dr. Marc Larochelle, said that the findings suggest that buprenorphine may be an effective treatment for opioid addiction and that it may help to reduce the risk of death from opioid overdose.
Claim: Drug can reduce risk of death from opioid overdose.
The claim veracity: true

7,34669,A teenaged girl was drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working on behalf of sex traffickers.,"The claim states that a teenage girl was drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working on behalf of sex traffickers. However, the article explains that this claim is likely a classic urban legend. The article mentions that on June 20, 2015, a Facebook user shared a screenshot of a text message describing a harrowing near miss abduction effort that supposedly occurred in the bathroom of a Dillard's department store in Denton, Texas. The text message claimed that two girls hid in the bathroom, pinned down the daughter, and injected her with black laced heroin, paralyzing her. The two girls then claimed that the daughter was their drunk friend and they were taking her home. The post also mentioned that these two girls worked for sex trafficking in Denton. The article points out that this claim is similar to other messages spread on social media about kidnappers working on behalf of sex traffickers. These messages often lack verifiable documentation and rely on the ""friend of a friend"" narrative. The article mentions other instances of similar claims, such as a warning about abductors in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store and warnings about human traffickers targeting college kids through job interviews. Local police quickly responded to the claim and stated that they could not find any report to substantiate it. They considered it a rumor or hoax and continued to investigate. Facebook users commenting on the post by the City of Denton Police Department linked to an article about human trafficking raids in Denton. However, the police clarified that the article was from July 2014, indicating that it was not related to the recent claim. In summary, the claim of a teenage girl being drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working for sex traffickers is likely an urban legend. The lack of verifiable documentation and the similarity to other social media warnings about sex trafficking suggest that this claim is not true. Local police also stated that they could not find any evidence to support the claim.",unproven,"Moreover, the referenced article linked described a police crackdown on a Denton County human trafficking operation that did not involve abductions of victims from department store restrooms, the use of heroin to drug unwitting teen shoppers, the intervention of a potential victim’s mother, the use of fellow teen girls as recruiting agents, or a situation that was halted before anyone was harmed. A separate article about the 2014 operation reported several arrests but made no mention of young girls being employed as operatives of a sex trafficking-related abduction ring.","The claim states that a teenage girl was drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working on behalf of sex traffickers.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for the treatment of patients with a rare form of leukemia. The drug, called Xospata, is a treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have a specific genetic mutation and have not responded to other treatments. AML is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, and it is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The FDA's approval of Xospata is based on the results of a clinical trial that showed that the drug was effective in treating patients with AML who had the specific genetic mutation. The trial included 138 patients with AML who had not responded to other treatments, and the results showed that Xospata was effective in reducing the number of cancer cells in the blood and bone marrow. The FDA's approval of Xospata is an important step forward in the treatment of patients with AML, and it provides a new option for patients who have not responded to other treatments.

Context: The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted its supplemental application and granted priority review to Imfinzi for the treatment of previously untreated late-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The FDA decision is a boost for the treatment as it competes against similar medicines from rivals Merck and Roche, and follows data in September which showed Imfinzi prolonged survival in SCLC patients when used with chemotherapy. AstraZeneca has already carved out a niche for Imfinzi, which boosts the body’s immune system to fight cancer cells, in the more common cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with an existing approval for use in situations where tumors have only spread in the chest. The FDA in March approved Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq for the treatment of SCLC. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo is also approved in cases where patients fail at least two other treatments. A final decision to approve Imfinzi for SCLC is expected in the first quarter of 2020, AstraZeneca said.
Claim: AstraZeneca's Imfinzi gets speedy FDA review for small cell lung cancer.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first drug to treat smallpox, in case of a possible future outbreak or bioterror attack. The contagious disease was eradicated in 1980, but there are concerns that it could be used as a bioweapon. The drug, called TPOXX, was developed by SIGA Technologies Inc. It was approved under the FDA's ""Animal Rule,"" which allows the use of animal studies to show a drug's effectiveness when it is not feasible or ethical to conduct human trials. The drug was tested on rabbits and monkeys infected with a similar virus. The FDA said that the drug's effectiveness was shown in studies on animals, but it has not been tested on humans with smallpox. The agency also said that the drug's safety was evaluated in more than 700 healthy human volunteers. The most common side effects were headache, nausea, and abdominal pain.

11,22336,David Prosser Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.,"The article discusses a claim made by Justice David Prosser during a debate with his opponent, JoAnne Kloppenburg, for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Prosser stated that Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer in the state Department of Justice only involved the prosecution of cases regarding the regulation of docks. Prosser argued that his own experience as a district attorney and lawmaker made him more qualified for the position. The article examines the validity of Prosser's claim by looking at the cases handled by Kloppenburg during her time at the Department of Justice. Prosser's campaign provided evidence of 46 cases involving Kloppenburg, with 76% of them related to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). However, only five of these cases dealt directly with docks. The Kloppenburg campaign provided a list of 17 published decisions of cases she argued before the state Appeals Court, none of which involved docks. They also mentioned that Kloppenburg had argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts and before the state Supreme Court, with few, if any, involving docks or piers. Prosser later admitted that he was aware of the breadth of cases handled by Kloppenburg and that his comment about docks was a ""rhetorical flourish."" However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent Kloppenburg's record. Prosser's comment aligns with attacks from Kloppenburg's critics in the campaign, suggesting that it was not meant as a joke. In conclusion, the article finds that Prosser's claim about Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer is false.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The article discusses a claim made by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that the state's wolf population has increased by 24% in the past year. The DNR's claim is based on a survey conducted in late winter, which found that the state's wolf population had increased from 704 to 880. However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent the state's wolf population. The DNR's survey only covers a small portion of the state's wolf range and does not include areas where wolves are known to be present. Additionally, the survey was conducted during a time when wolves are less active, which could have led to an underestimation of the population.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for the treatment of patients with a rare genetic disorder that causes the body to accumulate too much iron. The drug, called Exjade, is the first oral medication approved for the treatment of patients with thalassemia, a disorder that causes the body to produce too much hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. When the body produces too much hemoglobin, it also produces too much iron, which can build up in the body and cause serious health problems. Exjade works by binding to iron in the body and removing it through the urine. The drug is approved for use in patients with thalassemia who are at least 2 years old and have a high level of iron in their blood. The FDA's approval of Exjade is based on the results of a clinical trial that included 224 patients with thalassemia. The trial found that patients who took Exjade had a significant reduction in the amount of iron in their blood compared to patients who did not take the drug. The most common side effects of Exjade include diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The drug is not recommended for use in patients with severe liver or kidney problems.

14,6360,Judge: Treatment of Tennessee inmates with hep C improving.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160. The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment. Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider. The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases. Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population. Judge Crenshaw emphasized the importance of implementing the 2019 HCV Guidance and accelerating the approval of inmates for treatment to avoid future claims of inadequate treatment.",true,A federal judge in Nashville ruled this week that Tennessee’s treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C is not grossly inadequate but warned the state to make good on its promises to treat more patients more quickly.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160.

The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment.

Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for the treatment of patients with a rare form of leukemia. The drug, called Xospata, is a pill that can be taken at home and is intended for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have a specific genetic mutation and have not responded to other treatments. AML is a type of blood cancer that affects about 20,000 people in the U.S. each year, and about 10% of patients have the specific genetic mutation that Xospata targets. The drug was approved based on the results of a clinical trial that showed that 26% of patients who took Xospata had a complete remission of their cancer, meaning that all signs of the disease disappeared. The drug was also found to be effective in patients who had not responded to other treatments. The approval of Xospata is a significant development for patients with AML, as it provides a new treatment option for those who have not responded to other therapies. The drug is also convenient for patients, as it can be taken at home rather than requiring a hospital visit.

In September 2011, a guideline memo was issued stating that ""religious items"" including Bibles could not be used or given away during visits.

The intention behind the rule was to protect patients from unwanted proselytizing, but it was worded too broadly and caused public outcry.

The hospital was revising the policy to ensure it was articulated correctly and to protect patients' religious practices and culture. Another memorandum in January 2012 canceled the controversial instructions, and it was clarified that the policy was established in response to complaints from patients and families who were approached by unsolicited faith-based groups making disparaging remarks and using threatening language.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

While President Trump has made building a wall along the border a key part of his campaign and presidency, the U.S. government has not announced any plans to build a wall along the entire border. In fact, the U.S. government has only built a small portion of the wall, and it is unclear if the wall will ever be completed. The U.S. government has also faced significant opposition to the wall, with many people arguing that it is unnecessary and a waste of money. Additionally, the U.S. government has not provided any evidence that a wall would be effective in reducing illegal immigration or drug trafficking. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. government is planning to build a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border is false.

19,12694,It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.,"U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, has been critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but opposed his party's health care plan. Yoho claims that the ACA has driven people to Medicaid, a program he describes as a worldwide failure. However, when asked for evidence to support his claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world, Yoho's spokesman walked back the statement, saying that Yoho meant to point out that health care trends have not improved since the implementation of the ACA. Experts interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. While Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, research about outcomes comes with caveats. Medicaid recipients start out sicker, and healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care. Yoho referred to two articles by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, to support his claim. One article discussed a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon, which found that recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Another article by Cass cited a Harvard study that compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine, and New York with other states that made no change. The study found that only New York achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, the study's author, Ben Sommers, has since done additional research and found that deaths from treatable causes did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study found that differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals are not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. However, more research is needed to determine the effects on health outcomes. In conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence.

20,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs.

Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs. In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative. The DCYF expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs, indicating that his concern about the expenditure of taxpayer dollars is valid.

Context: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced that it will be providing $1.2 billion in assistance to farmers and ranchers affected by retaliatory tariffs. This assistance is part of the $12 billion aid package announced by the Trump administration in July 2018 to help farmers affected by the ongoing trade war with China. The USDA has stated that the first round of payments will be made in mid-to-late August, with the second and third rounds likely to be made in November and early January, respectively. The payments will be made through the Market Facilitation Program (MFP), which was established by the USDA to provide assistance to farmers affected by the trade war. The MFP is designed to help farmers who have been negatively impacted by the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other countries in response to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The program provides direct payments to farmers based on the amount of crops they produce, with the goal of offsetting the financial losses caused by the tariffs. The USDA has stated that the MFP will provide up to $12 billion in assistance to farmers, with the first round of payments totaling $4.7 billion. The payments will be made to farmers who produce a variety of crops, including soy"
21,10103,"Antibiotics speed up recovery from ear infections in young children, studies show","Two studies have found that antibiotics can speed up recovery from ear infections in young children. The studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that children who were given antibiotics had a higher rate of symptom relief after 7 days compared to those who were given a placebo. The absolute rate of symptom relief was 80% for the antibiotic-treated patients and 74% for the placebo-treated patients. The studies also found that antibiotics were more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis. These findings support current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to children with ear infections. The article provides expert commentary on the benefits of antibiotics for ear infections, as well as the risks and likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don't receive antibiotics. It emphasizes the importance of putting the benefits of antibiotics into context and considering the risk of harm. The article also mentions that limiting antibiotic use can increase the chance that future use of antibiotics will be effective. The article does not discuss the costs of antibiotic prescriptions to the individual or the costs of policies on the healthcare system and society. It is noted that more detail on the findings from the studies would have been useful, as well as a quantitative estimate of the benefits of antibiotics if available.

Overall, the article takes a careful approach to examining the evidence and supports the use of antibiotics for infants and toddlers with ear infections. It is based on the findings of two independent studies and provides valuable expert commentary.",true,"Of four stories we reviewed on this study (Washington Post blog, NPR, Los Angeles Times as well), two were blog pieces – this one and the Washington Post entry. This CNN effort was better in most ways than the opinionated blog from the Washington Post. It earned points for sticking to the evidence and providing independent perspectives about the value of antibiotics for treating childhood ear infections. We also applaud the story’s focus on shared decision-making between doctors and parents when managing ear infections. A bit more detail on costs and harms would have added value to this excellent story. Wanting the best for a child with an ear infection doesn’t necessarily mean opting for the most aggressive treatment. As Dr Richard Rosenfeld puts it in this story: “Medicine is about gray zones and balancing the risks and benefits. Parents and doctors need to understand what the benefits and what the downside of treatments are.” While the research discussed here confirms that antibiotics are likely to be beneficial for certain children with ear infections, no study can take the place of a careful consideration of individual circumstances. According to Rosenfeld: “It’s an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician.”","Two studies have found that antibiotics can speed up recovery from ear infections in young children.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The article claims that a story about the potential use of Viagra to treat heart symptoms of muscular dystrophy fails to provide important information and context. The story does not mention the high cost of treatment for pulmonary hypertension patients who use the Revatio brand of sildenafil, which can exceed $15,000 a year. It also does not mention the potential side effects of sildenafil, such as vision and hearing loss, chest pain, and shortness of breath. The story fails to provide specific data about the mice used in the study and does not mention that the continual administration of sildenafil over many months is more similar to the way the drug is used in patients with pulmonary hypertension, rather than the occasional doses used to treat erectile dysfunction. The article also criticizes the story for not interviewing any researchers or independent experts and for not providing information about how heart problems in patients with muscular dystrophy are currently managed or how sildenafil treatment compares to standard therapy. The story is also criticized for leading with old news and not putting the latest study in the proper context of other experiments.

26,11330,Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk,"The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The study involved 899 participants who were followed for an average of 9 years. During the study, 99 people developed dementia, resulting in a total incidence of dementia of 11%. The article mentions that consuming two or more servings of fish per week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%. However, it notes that this is a relative risk reduction and does not provide the absolute risk of developing dementia, which would be necessary to put the relative risk reduction into context. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil, had a lower risk of developing dementia. Plasma DHA levels were seen to correlate with the number of servings of fish or the amount of DHA consumed. The article also mentions potential harms from fish oil consumption and speculates on potential harms from fish consumption. It suggests that other behaviors associated with reduced dementia, such as social activities or better dietary variety, may be more common in those who eat more fish, potentially confounding the results. The article points out that neither DHA nor fish oil supplements have FDA approval for the prevention of dementia. It also mentions that DHA is found in fatty fish and fish oil supplements, but curiously includes ""some meats"" as a source of DHA. However, DHA is primarily found in significant quantities in the brain, retina, and testes, which are not frequently consumed by people. Overall, the article reports on the findings of the study and includes quotes from the study's senior author and an editorial about the research. It does not appear to rely on a press release and does not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer's disease.",mixture,"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it is information that a reader should be aware of. The headline of the story – ""Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk"" – is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled ""Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease"" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease.

Michigan is releasing nonviolent offenders over the age of 60 with health issues, and California is expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with less than 60 days left on their sentences. Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in combating COVID-19, as inmates live, work, and eat in close settings, increasing the potential for the virus to spread. Across the country, over 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 have died. In response to outbreaks, staff and inmates are required to wear masks in New York, Michigan, and California prisons. The CDC recommends the use of facial coverings, including homemade masks, to slow the spread of the virus. A May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with other measures, for correctional facilities. In conclusion, the claim that governors would have given masks to prison inmates if they prevent coronavirus is inaccurate. Masks have been distributed to inmates in the mentioned states, and inmates are being released as a measure to limit the spread of COVID-19, primarily focusing on nonviolent offenders or those who are not seen as a safety threat.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government is paying hospitals to inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths is false. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for reporting COVID-19 deaths, and hospitals are not being paid to inflate the numbers. The CDC guidelines state that COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death. The guidelines also state that the underlying cause of death is the condition that initiated the chain of events leading to death, and the cause of death should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I of the death certificate. The guidelines do not mention any financial incentives for hospitals to inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths. In fact, the guidelines state that the death certificate should be completed to the best of the certifier's knowledge, and the certifier should not be influenced by financial or other incentives. The guidelines also state that the death certificate should be completed in accordance with applicable state and local laws and regulations. In conclusion, the claim that the U.S. government is paying hospitals to inflate the number of COVID-19 deaths is false.

A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

30,12749,On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. Williams initially stated that he would not seek life without parole for individuals under 18, but a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that his stance had changed. Williams responded with a letter to the editor, stating that his approach is consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court. The article explains that the issue of juvenile lifers became complicated when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision, which prohibited mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles, would apply retroactively. This led to a process of resentencing individuals across the state, with judges having the final determination on each case. The Inquirer reported that Williams' office intends to seek life without parole for at least three of the cases it has reviewed so far. Williams' chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, stated that while Williams hopes not to have many juvenile murderers remain in custody, there are certain circumstances, such as heinous crimes, where life without parole may be necessary. PolitiFact questioned whether this move conflicts with Williams' previous statements that all 300 individuals would have a chance at parole. Martin argued that the judge would have the final determination, but this contradicts what the DA's office is requesting. The article concludes by stating that Williams' original goal was to give all juvenile lifers some chance of parole, but in the most heinous cases, this goal may not be met. The DA's office argues that Williams' stance has not changed, as he always acknowledged that there could be exceptions. Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding Williams' stance on parole for juvenile lifers and the discrepancy between his previous statements and the actions of his office.",false,"District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.","Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles.

Context: The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it will not prosecute former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for allegedly lying to investigators about a leak to the media. The DOJ's decision comes after a lengthy investigation into McCabe's actions, which included a recommendation from the U.S. attorney's office in Washington to bring charges against him. However, the DOJ has decided not to pursue the case, citing a lack of evidence and the difficulty of proving that McCabe intentionally lied to investigators. The investigation into McCabe's actions began in 2017, when the DOJ's inspector general found that he had authorized FBI officials to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. McCabe was later fired from the FBI for allegedly lying to investigators about his role in the leak. The U.S. attorney's office in Washington recommended that McCabe be charged with making false statements to investigators, but the DOJ has decided not to pursue the case. The DOJ's decision not to prosecute McCabe has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the decision, arguing that it was the right thing to do given the lack of evidence and the difficulty of proving that McCabe intentionally lied to investigators.

This claim has been widely cited by Republican leaders as a way to discredit the stimulus plan. The National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release criticizing 29 freshman House Democrats for supporting a spending plan that includes this funding. Republican Representative Eric Cantor also made this point in an interview with Fox News. The issue gained momentum after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it on its website.

The bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended this spending by stating that prevention measures are less expensive for states in the long run. The article also mentions that the Senate version of the bill includes slightly more funding for STD prevention. The Senate Appropriations committee approved a portion of the stimulus plan that states ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" The committee report justifies this spending by highlighting the high number of new STD infections in the United States and the preventable cost to the healthcare system.

The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
People should stop using e-cigarettes, especially those with marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), U.S. public health officials recommended on Friday, as an investigation into illnesses and deaths related to vaping deepens.

Context: The claim is that the House Democrats' stimulus package includes $335 million to fund prevention programs for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This claim has been widely cited by Republican leaders as a way to discredit the stimulus plan. The National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release criticizing 29 freshman House Democrats for supporting a spending plan that includes this funding. Republican Representative Eric Cantor also made this point in an interview with Fox News. The issue gained momentum after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it on its website. The article confirms that there is indeed STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats. The bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended this spending by stating that prevention measures are less expensive for states in the long run. The article also mentions that the Senate version of the bill includes slightly more funding for STD prevention. The Senate Appropriations committee approved a portion of the stimulus plan that states ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" The committee report justifies this spending by highlighting the high number of new STD infections in the United States and the preventable cost to the healthcare system. The article concludes by noting that while the $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis, which are not always transmitted sexually. Therefore, the claim that the stimulus package includes $335 million specifically for STD prevention programs is accurate, but it is important to recognize that the funding is allocated for a broader range of prevention programs as well.
Claim: The House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases.

Context: The claim is that the U.S. government has been secretly funding the Taliban in Afghanistan. This claim has been made by several sources, including a former Afghan intelligence chief and a former Taliban commander. The former Afghan intelligence chief, Amrullah Saleh, stated that the U.S. government has been providing financial support to the Taliban for years. He also claimed that the U.S. government has been providing weapons and training to the Taliban. The former Taliban commander, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, also stated that the U.S. government has been providing financial support to the Taliban. He claimed that the U.S. government has been providing weapons and training to the Taliban. The U.S. government has denied these claims. However, there is evidence that suggests that the U.S. government has been providing financial support to the Taliban. For example, in 2010, the U.S. government provided $1.5 million to the Taliban to help them fight the Islamic State. Additionally, in 2016, the U.S. government provided $1.5 million to the Taliban to help them fight the Islamic State. Therefore, the claim that the U.S. government has been secretly funding the Taliban in Afghanistan is true.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census was unlawful. The judge, Jesse M. Furman of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, stated that the decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations. The judge also found that the decision violated the Enumeration Clause of the Constitution, which requires a count of the ""whole number of persons in each state."" The judge's ruling is a victory for the plaintiffs in the case, which included 18 states, several cities, and a coalition of civil rights groups. The plaintiffs argued that the citizenship question would discourage immigrants from participating in the census, leading to an undercount of the population and a loss of federal funding and political representation for states with large immigrant populations. The Trump administration has argued that the citizenship question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but the judge found that this argument was ""pretextual"" and that the real reason for adding the question was to reduce the political power of states with large immigrant populations. The judge's ruling is a setback for the Trump administration, which has been pushing for the inclusion of the citizenship question on the census. The administration has not yet announced whether it will appeal the ruling.

33,9272,Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers,"The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers. However, the release lacks important information such as the cost of the drug compared to other asthma treatments currently in use. The release also fails to provide quantification of the results of the clinical tests and does not mention any potential side effects of the drug. The full research paper, which is behind a paywall, includes a table of adverse events experienced by patients in the study. The release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data regarding the reduction of eosinophil in sputum. However, it falls short in providing other indicators that would have strengthened it. The release includes funding sources but fails to mention any linkages between the study's authors and pharmaceutical firms, which is important for readers to ascertain bias. There is also no mention of alternative treatments for asthma or a comparison with current approaches. The release claims that the asthma pill is the first new one in nearly 20 years, but this is incorrect as several new drugs have come on the market in recent years. The release includes a conservative headline but allows the main researcher to proclaim the drug as a ""game changer"" and includes a testimonial from a study participant. The release also fails to include commentary from two unaffiliated experts, which would have improved its value.",false,"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily. The latter of the two didn’t offer “anything beyond what is in the news release,” according to reviewers.","The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers.

Three of the deceased were children, and nine individuals are in critical condition. The quake caused over 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, leading to a rescue effort to find those trapped under the rubble. The tremor also damaged buildings in the Turkish city of Van and several villages in Iran. In Iran, 75 people were injured, with six requiring hospitalization. Following the initial earthquake, there were several aftershocks, including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude. No immediate reports of damage or casualties were received from the subsequent quake. Both Iran and Turkey are prone to earthquakes due to their location on major fault lines. Turkish TV footage showed people using shovels and their hands to dig through the rubble, while damaged buildings, fallen roofs, and cracked walls were observed in various villages. The governor of Van confirmed the loss of life and widespread destruction in the affected areas. The earthquake had a depth of 5 km and struck at 8:53 a.m. The second significant quake occurred at 7:00 p.m. Dozens of villages in Turkey were rattled, and nearly 150 tents were sent to provide shelter for affected families. The Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority initiated rescue operations in villages near the epicenter. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter to be 47 km west of the Iranian city of Khoy.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging in children. The drug, called Zokinvy, is the first FDA-approved treatment for progeria and a related condition called progeroid laminopathy. Progeria is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, with symptoms such as hair loss, joint stiffness, and heart disease. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. The mutation leads to the production of an abnormal form of lamin A called progerin, which causes cells to age prematurely. Zokinvy, developed by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that blocks the production of progerin. The drug was approved based on the results of a clinical trial involving 62 children with progeria. The trial found that Zokinvy improved survival rates and reduced the risk of heart disease in children with progeria. The drug was also found to be safe and well-tolerated, with the most common side effects being diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. The approval of Zokinvy is a significant milestone for children with progeria and their families"
36,5367,TravelLab: Adults take over science museums when night falls.,"Science museums are hosting adult sleepovers, allowing grown-ups to explore the exhibits and learn about science in a unique and immersive way. The trend started at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which capitalized on the popularity of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. The sleepovers have become a hot ticket, with other science centers and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, and elsewhere following suit. During the sleepovers, guests have the opportunity to explore the museum's permanent exhibition halls, join guided tours, visit the planetarium, and meet with curators and museum scientists. The experience allows adults to experience the museum in a special way, without the crowds and rush of a typical visit during the day. The sleepovers also provide a chance for adults to have fun and embrace their inner child. Some attendees dress up in dinosaur costumes or onesies, adding to the playful atmosphere. The sleepovers typically include dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and guests can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum's cots, located below a 94-foot-long blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The sleepovers also have a scientific purpose. The quiet and stillness of the nighttime environment allows visitors to better absorb and learn from the exhibits. Biologist John Karavias explains that during the day, visitors often feel rushed and only get superficial reactions to the exhibits. At night, however, the background noise is quieted down, allowing visitors to digest the science behind what they are seeing. The sleepovers also provide an opportunity for museum staff to educate guests about important scientific topics. For example, visitors learn about the effects of climate change on marine life, such as the impact of ocean acidification on starfish and sea urchins. They also learn about animals that glow and the hidden language they use to communicate with each other.

37,2326,Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.,"A review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization has found that among 73 lower and middle-income nations, only four have adequate resources in place to provide necessary care for women and newborns. The four countries are Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Jordan. The review states that more than three-quarters of the countries face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, relieving pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths, and 289,000 maternal deaths, with over 92 percent of these deaths occurring in the countries reviewed.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

The ban, which went into effect in September, prohibits the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, with the exception of menthol and tobacco flavors. The state's Public Health and Health Planning Council voted to renew the regulations, citing concerns about the health risks of vaping and its popularity among teenagers.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

The claim is supported by various news reports and accounts from healthcare officials and leaders. The article mentions Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Massachusetts, who published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine detailing his experience with federal interference in obtaining a large shipment of face masks and respirators. He stated that before he could send the funds for the shipment, two FBI agents arrived and questioned him. After assuring them that the PPE was intended for hospitals, the agents allowed the equipment to be released. However, the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting the supplies, but intervention from a congressional representative prevented their seizure. The Los Angeles Times also reported that healthcare officials in seven states claimed that the federal government seized their PPE shipments without providing guidance on when or if they would receive the supplies they ordered. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that FEMA intervened in a deal the city had with a supplier to buy 1 million masks. A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government. The article mentions additional reports of federal interference in PPE procurement. Massachusetts state leaders confirmed a large order of PPE for healthcare workers, but the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, a hospital system had an agreement to receive four shipments of medical gear, but FEMA commandeered the supplies. Colorado Governor Jared Polis believed his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were taken by FEMA. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker expressed concerns that discussing how his state obtained masks and gloves could lead to federal officials seizing the materials. The article concludes by stating that the supply chain for PPE has been described as chaotic and competitive, with federal officials allegedly seizing shipments and disrupting deals between vendors and states. The FBI declined to comment on specific accounts of interference, but stated that they were working to prevent unlawful distribution or hoarding of PPE during the pandemic. The Department of Homeland Security did not provide a comment on the matter.",true,"What's true: Numerous health care officials and state leaders have reported instances in which federal authorities have intervened on local agencies' agreements with PPE vendors.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand.

Context: The article debunks a Facebook post claiming that there are two possible cases of coronavirus at Valley Regional Medical Center in Brownsville, Texas. The post appears to be a screenshot of another post published by the account Brownsville Online, but there is no evidence of such claims on their page. Health officials in the area have stated that there are no cases of coronavirus in the Rio Grande Valley, and Hidalgo County's health and human services department specifically called out social media posts for spreading misinformation. As of March 3, Texas was not one of the 12 states reporting cases of COVID-19 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Local news station KRGV also confirmed that Cameron County health officials stated there were no cases of the virus in the area. The Valley Regional Medical Center also released a statement saying they do not have any patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.

Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government is planning to release genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida is false. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved a permit for a company called Oxitec to release genetically modified mosquitoes in Florida and Texas. However, the EPA has not yet approved the release of these mosquitoes in Florida. The EPA's approval of the permit allows Oxitec to release the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, but the company has not yet received approval from the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District (FKMCD) to do so. The FKMCD has not yet made a decision on whether to allow the release of the mosquitoes, and the EPA's approval of the permit does not override the FKMCD's authority to make this decision. The EPA's approval of the permit is based on the agency's determination that the release of the mosquitoes will not have a significant impact on the environment.

The patient was not initially tested for the virus because they did not meet the CDC's criteria for testing, which includes travel to China or close contact with someone who has traveled to China. However, the patient was transferred to UC Davis Medical Center from another hospital and was tested for the virus on February 19. The CDC has stated that the patient was likely exposed to the virus in the community, as they had no travel history or contact with a known infected individual. The patient is currently in isolation and is in stable condition. The CDC is working with state and local health officials to identify and contact individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. The CDC has also issued a travel advisory for China, recommending that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to the country.

49,1382,Regulator grants license for Britain's first three-parent IVF babies.,"The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK has granted a license to a team of doctors in Newcastle to carry out the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique, which could result in the birth of the first child created in Britain using this method by the end of the year. The technique involves removing faulty mitochondria, which can cause serious health problems, from embryos and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a female donor. This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor. The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues. The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases. The UK has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debates regarding pro-nuclear transfer techniques. However, it is not the first country to have children born using three-parent IVF treatment, as the world's first known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 with the help of US doctors at a clinic in Mexico. Critics of the treatment argue that it is a dangerous step that could lead to the creation of genetically modified ""designer babies."" Nevertheless, fertility specialists have praised the decision, with one calling it a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome.

The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues. The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug, called Zulresso, for the treatment of postpartum depression. This is the first drug specifically approved for this condition, which affects about 400,000 women in the United States each year. The drug is administered as a single 60-hour intravenous infusion and is expected to be available in June. The FDA's approval of Zulresso is based on two clinical trials that showed the drug to be effective in reducing symptoms of postpartum depression. The drug is a synthetic version of the hormone allopregnanolone, which is produced naturally in the body and is thought to play a role in regulating mood. The drug is expected to be expensive, with a price tag of $34,000 for the 60-hour infusion. However, the manufacturer, Sage Therapeutics, has said that it will offer a patient assistance program to help with the cost. The approval of Zulresso is a significant step forward in the treatment of postpartum depression, which can be a debilitating condition for new mothers.

The claim originated from a fake news website called Huzlers, which is known for publishing satirical and fictional stories. The website itself states that it is a fake news and satire entertainment website. Therefore, the claim is not based on factual information. Furthermore, the world suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, so it would be impossible to determine if Paul's video had any impact on the suicide rate within a few days. The video was uploaded on December 31, 2017, and the suicide rate does not change so quickly. Logan Paul's video titled ""We Found A Dead Body in Japan's Suicide Forest"" received widespread condemnation. The video featured footage of a man who had recently taken his own life. Paul faced backlash from the public, his fans, and mental health advocates. He later apologized for the video. Suicide is a serious issue in Japan, particularly in the so-called suicide forest that Paul visited. Japan records over 20,000 suicide deaths annually. However, the suicide rate in Japan has been declining in recent years due to prevention efforts by Japanese officials. The most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the suicide rate is from 2015. According to WHO, the suicide rate in 2015 was 10.7 per 100,000 people. It is important to note that this data is not related to Logan Paul's video and does not support the claim that the suicide rate dropped following the video's release. In conclusion, the claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is false.

Logan Paul's video titled ""We Found A Dead Body in Japan's Suicide Forest"" received widespread condemnation. The video featured footage of a man who had recently taken his own life. Paul faced backlash from the public, his fans, and mental health advocates. He later apologized for the video.

Suicide is a serious issue in Japan, particularly in the so-called suicide forest that Paul visited. Japan records over 20,000 suicide deaths annually. However, the suicide rate in Japan has been declining in recent years due to prevention efforts by Japanese officials.

The most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the suicide rate is from 2015. According to WHO, the suicide rate in 2015 was 10.7 per 100,000 people. It is important to note that this data is not related to Logan Paul's video and does not support the claim that the suicide rate dropped following the video's release.

In conclusion, the claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is false. The claim originated from a fake news website, and the suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

55,10570,Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality,"A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device. The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators. The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing. It also emphasizes the need for further trials before there is enough evidence to apply for FDA approval. The trials of the new device were funded by the manufacturer, and the lead researcher is the founder of the company. The report includes an independent source, which adds credibility to the information presented. It is important to note that the new device does not offer the heart pacemaker function that some existing implantable defibrillators have.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device. The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators. The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing. It also emphasizes the need for further trials before there is enough evidence to apply for FDA approval. The trials of the new device were funded by the manufacturer, and the lead researcher is the founder of the company. The report includes an independent source, which adds credibility to the information presented. It is important to note that the new device does not offer the heart pacemaker function that some existing implantable defibrillators have. The report suggests that the new device could be an incremental improvement on existing devices for certain patients, depending on the results of further trials. In conclusion, the report highlights the progress made towards developing implantable defibrillators that do not require wires attached directly to the heart. It emphasizes the need for further research and trials before the device can be considered for clinical use and FDA approval in the United States.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for the treatment of a rare genetic disorder that causes a buildup of fatty material in the body's cells. The drug, called Xenpozyme, is the first FDA-approved treatment for the disorder, known as Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1). NPC1 is a progressive and often fatal disorder that affects about 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. It is caused by a mutation in the NPC1 gene, which leads to the accumulation of fatty material in the body's cells. Symptoms of NPC1 can include difficulty swallowing, seizures, and loss of muscle control. The FDA's approval of Xenpozyme is based on the results of a clinical trial that showed the drug was effective in reducing the accumulation of fatty material in the body's cells. The trial involved 49 patients with NPC1, who were given either Xenpozyme or a placebo. The patients who received Xenpozyme showed a significant reduction in the accumulation of fatty material in their cells, compared to those who received the placebo. The FDA's approval of Xenpozyme is a significant step forward in the treatment of NPC1, and it is hoped that the"

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Despite his illness, Dierdorf had expressed a desire to fly in a military helicopter with his fellow veterans, known as the Dirty Half Dozen. The Dierdorfs reached out to the Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice of the Wabash Valley to arrange a Bell UH-1 Iroquois ""Huey"" ride for the group. Although Dierdorf was unable to participate in the flight due to his condition, he was able to reunite with his friends and witness their experience, which fulfilled his last wish. Dierdorf's wife, Kim, stated that he had been talking about the flight nonstop since Saturday and that it meant a lot to him. Gil Edgington, one of the Dirty Half Dozen friends, expressed that Dierdorf's final wish being fulfilled was fitting for someone as kind and full of life as him. He believed that it was all part of God's plan and that Dierdorf's passing meant an end to his suffering.

59,7685,China expands switch from polluting coal heating in 2018: environment minister.,"China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie. Last year, 4.8 million households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity, up from 4 million households in 2017. China's winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal annually, and converting to low-emission heating was seen as a key part of the country's fight against pollution. Additionally, China has implemented ultra-low emissions technology in over 80 percent of its coal-fired power generation capacity. However, Li Ganjie warned that despite the progress made in 2018, China's battle against smog is becoming more challenging. He stated that the easy tasks have already been completed, and the remaining tasks are more difficult. While China reduced the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent in 2018, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, Li Ganjie believes it is still too high. He also mentioned regional disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection measures. China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry is determined to continue its efforts to curb pollution. However, concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 increased over the winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities rising by 13 percent from October to February. In response to these challenges, China announced that it would implement special emissions restrictions for the third consecutive winter. Premier Li Keqiang also stated that the government would continue to strengthen pollution controls in 2019. Despite the difficulties, China remains committed to reducing pollution and improving air quality.",true,"China expanded its coal-to-gas and coal-to-electricity projects to 35 cities in 2018 from 12 cities the previous year, China’s environment minister, Li Ganjie, said on Monday, as the world’s second-largest economy stepped up its fight against smog.","China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging in children. The drug, called Zokinvy, is the first FDA-approved treatment for progeria and a related condition called progeroid laminopathies. Progeria is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, with symptoms such as hair loss, stiff joints, and heart disease. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called lamin A. The mutation causes the production of an abnormal version of the protein, which leads to the rapid aging seen in progeria. Zokinvy, developed by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that works by blocking the buildup of the abnormal protein. The drug was approved based on two studies that showed it could increase the average survival time of children with progeria by about 2.5 years. The most common side effects of Zokinvy include vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and sores in the mouth. The drug is not a cure for progeria, but it is a significant step forward in the treatment of the disorder."

The drug, called Tegsedi, is the first FDA-approved treatment for patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR). This disorder is caused by a mutation in the TTR gene, which leads to the buildup of abnormal proteins in the body's tissues and organs. Symptoms of hATTR can include nerve damage, heart problems, and kidney failure. Tegsedi is an antisense oligonucleotide, which is a type of drug that targets specific genetic material to reduce the production of a disease-causing protein. In clinical trials, Tegsedi was shown to significantly reduce the levels of TTR protein in the blood and improve symptoms in patients with hATTR. The drug is administered as a subcutaneous injection once a week. The most common side effects of Tegsedi include injection site reactions, nausea, and fatigue. The FDA's approval of Tegsedi is a significant step forward in the treatment of hATTR, which is a rare and debilitating disorder.

Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan compared the situation to the coal industry, stating that these companies are trying to avoid regulation. The CEOs at Davos have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging through various initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme. However, Greenpeace argues that recycling is not enough and calls for plastic packaging bans and a goal of ""peak plastic.""

The CEOs of Unilever and PepsiCo have acknowledged the urgency of the issue and have made commitments to reduce plastic packaging. Unilever, for example, promised in 2017 to ensure that all of its plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging in children. The drug, called Zokinvy, is the first FDA-approved treatment for progeria and a related condition called progeroid laminopathy. Progeria is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, with symptoms such as hair loss, joint stiffness, and heart disease. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which encodes a protein called lamin A. The mutation causes the production of an abnormal form of lamin A, which leads to the rapid aging seen in progeria patients. Zokinvy, developed by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that works by blocking the production of the abnormal form of lamin A. The drug was approved based on the results of a clinical trial that showed that it significantly improved the survival rate of progeria patients. The trial included 62 patients with progeria or progeroid laminopathy, and the results showed that the drug increased the median survival rate by 2.5 years. The FDA's approval of Zokinvy is a"
65,11409,Study finds computers hinder accuracy in mammography,"A study has found that the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) in mammography may hinder accuracy rather than improve it. The article mentions that the cost of using CAD adds about $20 to the cost of each mammogram, but this charge is covered by Medicare and most insurers.

However, the article points out that the harm of unnecessary biopsies was mentioned, but the increased number of biopsies was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute value. It suggests that the use of CAD may increase the number of cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which may not pose a health risk during a woman's lifetime.

66,644,Climate change endangers Scotland's archaeological treasures.,"Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change. With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change. A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970. Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers. In 2018, it attracted 112,000 visitors. HES climate change scientist David Harkin emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and protect these archaeological treasures. He acknowledges that climate change is already happening and that the pace of change will accelerate. However, he also believes that there is an opportunity to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and avoid the destruction of sites like Skara Brae.

Context: The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it will not prosecute former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired from the agency in 2018. McCabe was accused of lying to investigators about his role in a news media disclosure, but the DOJ has now dropped the case. The decision comes after a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. declined to indict McCabe in September 2019. McCabe's lawyers have criticized the DOJ for taking so long to reach a decision, as the investigation has been ongoing for nearly two years. They have also accused the DOJ of being politically motivated in its pursuit of McCabe. The DOJ has denied these allegations, stating that the investigation was conducted in a fair and impartial manner. McCabe's lawyers have also argued that the DOJ's decision not to prosecute is a vindication of their client. They have stated that the DOJ's investigation was flawed and that the evidence against McCabe was weak. The DOJ has not commented on these claims.

67,10900,Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery,"A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery. Atrial fibrillation after surgery can lead to longer hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. The study involved 60 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either botulinum toxin or saline injections. The results showed that there were no additional complications from the Botox injections compared to the saline group. However, more details about the study, such as baseline differences between the groups and the number of vessels engrafted, were not provided. The funding sources for the study were noted as The Russian State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology and the Siberian Division of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The article also mentions that other attempts have been made to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery using different drugs, but with varying results. It is noted that botulinum toxin is already available and used in cosmetic dermatology under the trade name Botox Cosmetic. However, this is the first time it has been tested in human hearts, so it may take several years before it receives approval as a preventative for heart complications. The article concludes by stating that larger studies are needed to further investigate the potential benefits of botulinum toxin in preventing atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery.",true,"This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery.

The study, published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, analyzed data from over 300,000 patients with type 2 diabetes in Taiwan. The results showed that those who took metformin had a 20% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who did not take the drug. The study also found that the longer a patient took metformin, the lower their risk of developing dementia. However, the study did not prove that metformin caused the lower risk of dementia, and more research is needed to confirm the findings.

The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and five months later, the agency responded with a letter to Tvedten, ordering him to cease and desist the construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond. The letter stated that a permit must be issued prior to this type of activity and failure to comply could result in elevated enforcement action. Tvedten responded to the DEQ's demand with a letter explaining that the dams were actually built by beavers and not by him. He challenged the DEQ to try and emulate the beavers' dam project and questioned whether the beavers were entitled to legal representation. Tvedten argued that the beavers had the right to build their dams and that the DEQ should focus on other environmental issues, such as bears defecating in the woods. The DEQ later claimed that they were aware the dams were beaver dams, but the issue was that the beavers had abandoned the dams and Tvedten had been maintaining and building them up himself.

The beavers are likely still ignorant of how close they came to being fined $10,000 a day for dam living expenses.","In July 1997, a neighbor of Stephen Tvedten noticed flooding on his property and traced it back to a dam on Tvedten's stream.

Context: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has issued a public health alert for raw ground turkey products linked to an outbreak of salmonella. The outbreak has resulted in 90 illnesses in 26 states, with 40 hospitalizations and no deaths. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is investigating the outbreak and has not yet identified a single supplier or brand of raw ground turkey products. The agency is also not recommending that consumers avoid eating properly cooked turkey products. The FSIS is urging consumers to properly handle and cook raw turkey products to prevent foodborne illness. The agency recommends that consumers wash their hands before and after handling raw turkey, cook raw turkey thoroughly to kill harmful bacteria, and use a food thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the turkey reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. The FSIS also advises consumers to avoid cross-contamination by keeping raw turkey separate from other foods and using separate cutting boards, plates, and utensils for raw turkey. The agency also recommends that consumers refrigerate raw turkey within two hours of purchase or one hour if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

70,10611,Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise,"A recent article titled ""Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise"" discusses a new experimental treatment for peanut allergies that has shown positive results in early studies. The article mentions that the treatment has been tested on a small number of patients, with most of them showing improved resistance to peanut allergens. Five patients were able to tolerate peanuts without any reaction, while four had to withdraw from the study due to intolerance to the treatment. The article also mentions that the second test involved splitting the subjects into treatment and placebo groups, with approximate outcomes for each group described. However, the article is criticized for not providing enough information about the methodology and outcomes of the studies. It is noted that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and the study groups were very small, consisting of only 33 and 18 subjects. The article should have made it clear from the beginning that the evidence is of low quality and that more study is needed. The article also fails to provide a sufficient warning about potential harms and the need for close medical supervision. It is mentioned in the last line that parents should not try the approach at home, but this warning should have appeared earlier. Additionally, the article does not mention whether those who did not tolerate the treatment required any intervention to quell allergic reactions. The only source quoted in the article is Dr. Wesley Burks of Duke University Medical Center, one of the researchers involved in the study. However, it is not disclosed that Burks has financial relationships with companies related to allergies. The article should have included an additional source with no connection to the research. The article does mention that there are no approved treatments for food allergies and that the experimental treatment for peanut allergy is in the early stages of human research. However, it is suggested that this information should have been made clearer earlier in the story. Lastly, the article states that nearly half of the deaths attributed to food allergies in the United States each year are caused by peanut allergies, according to Duke University. However, there is a minor discrepancy between the article and a Duke University press release regarding the inclusion of the words ""in the United States.""

The lede gets in trouble early when it says the treatment ""raises the possibility of a cure for this potentially life-threatening condition."" In the next paragraph it conveys a lead researcher’s assertion that a treatment ""may be developed in two or three years."" Only later come the reminders that these are small pilot studies. This is a common pattern in news reporting: Run with the promise, and let the caveats catch up by the end of the story.

In conclusion, the article disputes Biden's claim that cervical cancer in Africa is fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. While cervical cancer is highly preventable, the lack of infrastructure and resources in Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, make it difficult to achieve the same level of prevention as in developed countries.

Context: The article discusses the recent outbreak of measles in the United States and the role of the anti-vaccination movement in the spread of the disease. It mentions that the anti-vaccination movement has been fueled by a fraudulent study linking the measles vaccine to autism, which has since been debunked. The article also cites a study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, which found that the anti-vaccination movement has been a major factor in the spread of measles in the United States. The study analyzed data from 2000 to 2015 and found that the anti-vaccination movement was responsible for a significant increase in the number of measles cases. The article also mentions that the anti-vaccination movement has been particularly active in certain areas of the country, such as California, where the number of measles cases has been on the rise.

72,4447,New genetic links to same-sex sexual behavior found.,"A genome-wide research study on DNA from nearly half a million U.S. and U.K. adults has identified five genetic variants that were more common in people who reported ever having had a same-sex sexual partner. However, the study found that none of these genetic variants cause same-sex behavior nor can predict whether someone will be gay. The researchers believe that thousands more genetic variants are likely involved and interact with non-inherited factors. The study, published in the journal Science, provides insight into the genetic underpinnings of same-sex sexual behavior but emphasizes that genetics is only a contributing factor and less than half of the story. The study focused on behavior rather than sexual identity or orientation and included participants of European ancestry only. The study also found that some of the genetic variants were present in both men and women, with two variants in men located near genes involved in male-pattern baldness and sense of smell. The researchers acknowledged the limitation of the study and noted that it cannot answer whether similar results would be found in other groups. The origins of same-sex behavior are uncertain, with many scientists believing that social, cultural, family, and other biological factors are also involved. The study's findings have been met with varied reactions from experts. Some experts believe that the study advances the understanding of the genetics of human sexual preference, while others argue that the absence of information on sexual orientation in the study makes it unclear what the identified genetic links might signify.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

75,1308,Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned of shortages as more than 1.5 million Americans have received the vaccine since the end of last year. GSK has increased deliveries significantly and is vaccinating people against shingles at a faster rate than before, but it is struggling to keep up with the high demand. The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck's older and less effective vaccine, leading to strong demand. Consensus forecasts predict peak annual sales for Shingrix of around £1.5 billion ($2 billion), but Exane BNP analysts believe this estimate may be too low.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging in children. The drug, called Zokinvy, is the first FDA-approved treatment for progeria and progeroid laminopathies, which are genetic conditions that cause premature aging and death. The drug was developed by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, a small California-based company, and will be marketed by PTC Therapeutics. The drug is expected to cost $485,000 per year, but the company has said it will offer discounts to some patients. The FDA's approval of Zokinvy is based on two studies that showed the drug was effective in treating progeria and progeroid laminopathies. The studies found that the drug increased the lifespan of patients by an average of 2.5 years. The drug is not a cure for the conditions, but it is expected to improve the quality of life for patients. The approval of Zokinvy is a significant milestone for the treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathies, and it is hoped that the drug will help to improve the lives of patients with these conditions.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes a buildup of fatty material in the body's cells. The drug, called Xenpozyme, is the first FDA-approved treatment for the disorder, known as Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1). NPC1 is a progressive and often fatal disorder that affects about 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. It is caused by a mutation in the NPC1 gene, which leads to the accumulation of fatty material in the body's cells. Symptoms of NPC1 can include difficulty swallowing, seizures, and cognitive decline. Xenpozyme, which is manufactured by the pharmaceutical company Actelion, is a type of enzyme replacement therapy. It works by replacing the missing enzyme that is responsible for breaking down fatty material in the body's cells. In clinical trials, Xenpozyme was shown to improve symptoms of NPC1, including difficulty swallowing and cognitive decline. The drug was also found to be safe and well-tolerated. Xenpozyme is expected to be available in the U.S. in the coming months. It will be administered as an intravenous infusion every two"

Context: The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced that it will be providing $1.2 billion in relief to farmers who have been affected by the ongoing trade war with China. The aid package, which is the second round of assistance for farmers, will be distributed through the Market Facilitation Program (MFP). The MFP was created last year to help farmers who have been impacted by the trade war, and the first round of assistance was distributed in 2018. The new round of aid will be distributed in three payments, with the first payment being made in August. The second and third payments will be made in November and January, respectively. The USDA has stated that the aid package is necessary to help farmers who have been struggling due to the trade war. The trade war has caused a significant drop in the price of many agricultural products, and farmers have been struggling to make ends meet. The USDA hopes that the aid package will help farmers to stay afloat until the trade war is resolved.

But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.,"The article discusses a claim made by Hillary Clinton during a campaign speech in Shenandoah, Iowa. Clinton argued that the federal government is not adequately protecting the public due to insufficient inspections of toys and food. She used the example of a ham and cheese sandwich to illustrate her point, stating that a sandwich on one slice of bread falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which conducts daily inspections of manufacturers. However, a sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only inspects manufacturers about once every five years. To verify Clinton's claim, the article refers to government reports on food safety, interviews with the head of the USDA's food inspection service, and the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. It confirms that Clinton's example is correct, highlighting the significant disparity in inspections conducted by the two agencies. Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged the absurdity of the sandwich rule and admitted that it defies logic. However, he stated that the rule does not impact the safety of the nation's food supply. The article explains that the distinction between USDA and FDA jurisdiction over sandwiches can be traced back to Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, published in 1906. The book exposed horrific conditions in meat plants and led to the enactment of a law requiring meat inspections. Since then, the USDA has focused on meat and poultry inspections, while other foods fall under the FDA's purview. The FDA, however, does not have a mandate for regular inspections, and a report by the Government Accountability Office confirms that the agency inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years on average. Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, criticizes the current food safety system, stating that it is based on antiquated laws and divided agencies. She argues that the lack of regular inspections and insufficient funding for the FDA puts the public at risk. These concerns are echoed in a report from an FDA advisory panel, which states that the agency is overburdened and underfunded, making it unable to effectively conduct routine surveillance of the nation's food supply. In conclusion, the article confirms that Hillary Clinton's claim about the regulation of sandwiches and the disparity in inspections by the USDA and FDA is accurate.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: A 2017 study published in the journal Nature found that the average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. The study also found that the top 10% of sugar consumers consume an average of 46 teaspoons of added sugar per day. This high level of sugar consumption is linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The study also found that the top 10% of sugar consumers are more likely to be obese and have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Robert Lustig, said that the findings highlight the need for public health interventions to reduce sugar consumption. He also noted that the study's findings are consistent with other research that has linked high sugar consumption to negative health outcomes. The study's findings have important implications for public health policy and interventions aimed at reducing sugar consumption.

82,1972,Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.,"A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s. The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine. According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption. The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.",true,"Americans may be cutting back on super-sized meals, but waistlines continue to expand from more frequent eating, according to a study released on Wednesday.","A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. 

Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s.

The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine.

According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first drug specifically developed for severe depression. The drug, called esketamine, is a chemical cousin of ketamine, which is used as an anesthetic and a club drug. It is administered as a nasal spray and works more quickly than typical antidepressants, which can take weeks to take effect. However, esketamine is not intended to be used as a first-line treatment for depression and is only approved for patients who have not responded to at least two other medications. The drug will be tightly controlled and only available through a restricted distribution system. Patients will not be able to take the drug home and will only be able to receive it in a medical clinic or doctor's office. The drug will also be given with an antidepressant pill and patients will be monitored for at least two hours after receiving the nasal spray. The FDA's approval of esketamine is a significant development in the treatment of depression, as it is the first new type of depression drug in decades. However, some experts have raised concerns about the potential for abuse of the drug, as it is a close relative of ketamine, which is known to be abused as a club"

The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision. He stated that they will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by the product.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new drug for treating a rare genetic disorder that causes rapid aging in children. The drug, called Zokinvy, is the first FDA-approved treatment for progeria and a related condition called progeroid laminopathy. The drug was developed by Eiger BioPharmaceuticals Inc. and is expected to be available in early 2021. Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly. It affects about one in every 4 million births worldwide and is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene. Children with progeria typically die in their early teens from heart disease. Zokinvy works by blocking the production of a protein that is overproduced in progeria patients. In a clinical trial, the drug was found to increase the average lifespan of progeria patients by 2.5 years. The drug is expected to cost about $485,000 for a year's supply, but Eiger BioPharmaceuticals has said that it will offer financial assistance to patients who cannot afford the drug. The approval of Zokinvy is a significant milestone for progeria"

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Justin Bieber and Katy Perry made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles is not supported by credible sources. The articles that reported on these statements were published on unreliable websites known for spreading conspiracy theories. The article from YourNewsWire, written by Dmitry Baxter, suggested that Bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour because he realized that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business. However, there is no evidence to support these claims, and no mainstream news outlets have quoted or mentioned such statements by Bieber or Perry. While it is true that Bieber canceled part of his 2017 tour and Perry expressed her struggles with her public persona, these facts do not lend credibility to the claims about pedophilia in the music industry. The statements attributed to Bieber and Perry are lurid fabrications designed to gain social media attention or spread disinformation about ""Hollywood elites."" The dissemination of these false stories not only dilutes the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by credible sources like Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood but also poses a risk of inciting violence. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which falsely claimed that a pizza restaurant in Washington DC was running a pedophile ring, led to a shooting incident. It is crucial to avoid false reporting on such sensitive topics as child abuse.

The players, who train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti's largest slum, faced off in a match on the anniversary of the earthquake as a commemoration of the disaster. Many people in Haiti lost limbs in the earthquake, and the players have received treatment, athletic training, and prosthetic limbs through a program funded by Miami's Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus. Over 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs so far, with hundreds more set to begin treatment in the coming weeks and months. Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, there is a sense of pessimism and despair in Haiti. The country was already impoverished before the earthquake, with 70% of the population living on less than $2 a day. The rebuilding efforts have been slow, and major streets in the capital city of Port-au-Prince are still covered in debris.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

The Associated Press (AP) has announced that it will no longer use the term in its news stories, instead opting for more neutral language such as ""people who are in a country illegally"" or ""without legal permission."" The AP's decision has been met with criticism from some, who argue that the term ""illegal immigrant"" is accurate and that the AP is bowing to political correctness. However, others argue that the term is dehumanizing and that it is important to use language that is respectful and accurate.

However, Tanzania denies these reports and claims that no cases of Ebola have been confirmed. The government is facing mounting pressure to provide clarification on the situation. The foreign affairs ministry has not yet commented on the U.S. advisory. Authorities in east and central Africa have been on high alert for possible spillovers of Ebola from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where an outbreak has already claimed over 2,100 lives. Tanzania shares a border with the DRC, separated by a lake. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently criticized Tanzania for refusing to provide details of suspected Ebola cases, which goes against international health regulations. The WHO expressed concern over the lack of transparency but stated that it has no evidence of Ebola presence in Tanzania. The organization ruled out punitive action and reiterated its advice against travel or trade restrictions. In response to Tanzania's lack of transparency, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traveled to Tanzania at the direction of U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar. Azar had previously criticized Tanzania for not sharing information. Tanzania summoned the WHO's local representative over their assertion of suspected Ebola cases in the country. The government had previously investigated two cases of unknown illnesses, but they tested negative for Ebola. The situation in Tanzania highlights the importance of transparency in combating the deadly and fast-spreading hemorrhagic fever. With the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the neighboring DRC, authorities are on high alert and urging countries to share information to prevent the spread of the disease.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to consumers to avoid vaping products that contain THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. This warning comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall"

The article examines each of these claims individually. Regarding worker deaths, the article cites various sources that indicate Texas had the highest number of worker fatalities in 2010.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

91,27876,The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.,"The article confirms the claim that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. Giant hogweed is an invasive herb in the carrot family that was originally brought to North America from Asia. It has become established in various regions of the United States, including New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northwest. The plant grows along streams and rivers, as well as in fields, forests, yards, and roadsides. It can reach a height of 14 feet or more, with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width. The sap of the giant hogweed contains toxic chemicals called furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis. This condition leads to reddening of the skin, followed by severe blistering and burns. The injuries can last for several months, and even after they have healed, the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. If the sap enters the eyes, it can cause temporary or even permanent blindness. If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, it is recommended to take the following steps: if a reaction occurs, applying topical steroids early on may lessen the severity of the reaction and provide relief. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so it is advised to apply sunblock and keep the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible. The article also mentions that giant hogweed is not the only dangerous plant one might encounter. Other plants that can cause harm include oleander, a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways, and sago palm, a decorative shrub found in gardens and homes. In conclusion, the article confirms that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.

92,8845,Repeat blood clots more common with stents: study.,"A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot. This risk is particularly high for patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago. Stents are wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the coronary arteries to keep them from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. However, clots can form inside the stent, known as stent thrombosis, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack or death. The researchers found that the use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis. Patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment were 4.2 times more likely to experience another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who had previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times more likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times more likely to suffer a repeat episode. The study analyzed 437 patients with various types of stents who had experienced stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. Of these patients, 16.9 percent had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis, with 61 patients experiencing two episodes, 12 patients experiencing three episodes, and one patient experiencing four episodes. In conclusion, the study highlights the increased risk of repeat blood clots in patients who have had a coronary stent. The use of an additional stent during emergency treatment, a history of heart attack, and late stent thrombosis were identified as factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing another episode of stent thrombosis. These findings emphasize the importance of closely monitoring patients with stents to prevent further complications.",true,"Treating a stent-related blood clot with an additional stent in an emergency procedure sharply raises the risk that a patient will get a second clot and should be avoided, Dutch researchers said on Saturday.","A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: A study published in the journal Nature Medicine has found that a new type of drug, called a ""molecular glue,"" can effectively target and destroy cancer cells. The drug, called DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, works by targeting a protein called DDB1, which is found in high levels in cancer cells. The drug binds to DDB1 and causes it to be destroyed, leading to the death of the cancer cells. The study, led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that the drug was effective in killing cancer cells in both laboratory tests and in mice. The researchers also found that the drug was well-tolerated by the mice, with no significant side effects. The study's lead author, Dr. Kevan Shokat, said that the drug could potentially be used to treat a wide range of cancers, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer. He also noted that the drug could be used in combination with other cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, to improve their effectiveness. The study's findings are promising, but more research is needed to determine the drug's safety and effectiveness in humans.

93,1688,Amazonian tribe study shows how human bodily bacteria is changing.,"A study published in the journal Science Advances has found that the gut, mouth, and skin microbes of the Yanomami villagers, an isolated tribe in southern Venezuela's Amazonian jungles, possess the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in humans. The Yanomami villagers, who were secluded from the outside world until 2009, have bacteria that include some never before detected in humans. Surprisingly, the researchers also found antibiotic-resistant genes in the Yanomami's microbes, even though they have never been exposed to commercial antibiotics. The human body hosts trillions of microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, which are essential for human health. However, modern practices such as processed foods and antibiotics have led to a decline in microbiota diversity. This decline may be linked to the increase in immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes, and obesity. The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 Yanomami villagers and compared them to a group from the United States, another indigenous group from the Venezuelan Amazonian region called the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. The Yanomami villagers were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties compared to the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the other groups offer beneficial effects, such as protecting against kidney stones. The Yanomami villagers are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in a remote mountainous region. The researchers believe that studying their microbiota provides a unique opportunity to understand the impact of modern practices on human bodily bacteria. The findings of this study suggest that the pre-modern human microbiota had a greater diversity of bacteria and bacterial functions compared to populations affected by modern practices. Overall, this study highlights how modern life may be altering humankind's bodily bacteria and the potential consequences of a decline in microbiota diversity.",true,"Everyone’s body is brimming with bacteria, and these microbes do plenty of good things like building the immune system and helping digestion.

The program aims to support the emerging industry of hemp and medicinal cannabis, which have shown benefits in various areas such as health, quality of life, and the production of natural fibers.

The university has already obtained approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to grow hemp. In the spring, SIU plans to begin planting hemp on a 5-acre parcel of land, which will be divided into individual test plots to study specific research questions related to optimal growing conditions and environmental impact.

Illinois has allowed the sale of medical marijuana since 2015, but only to patients with a limited number of documented conditions. However, in August, Governor Bruce Rauner signed legislation expanding access to medical cannabis and permitting its use as a painkiller. Rauner also lifted the state ban on planting hemp.

SIU's decision to offer programs in marijuana and hemp research aligns with the growing trend of colleges and universities across the country providing courses related to cannabis. The university aims to meet the demand for scientific knowledge in this field and position itself to support the emerging industry.","You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first drug derived from marijuana, which is used to treat two rare and severe forms of epilepsy. The drug, called Epidiolex, is made from cannabidiol (CBD), a component of marijuana that does not cause intoxication. It is approved for patients two years of age and older with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, which are difficult to treat with other medications. The FDA's approval of Epidiolex is a significant milestone for patients with these conditions, as it provides a new treatment option that has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of seizures. The drug's approval is also a step forward for the medical use of marijuana, as it demonstrates that the FDA is willing to consider the potential benefits of marijuana-derived products for certain medical conditions. However, it is important to note that the FDA has not approved marijuana itself for any medical use, and it remains illegal under federal law. The approval of Epidiolex is a positive development for patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, and it may pave the way for further research and development of marijuana-derived products for medical use.

The ad claims that if Cory Gardner gets his way, people should stock up on condoms because he wants to ban birth control. The ad is sponsored by NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado and is aimed at reaching young voters. The Gardner campaign denies the claim made in the ad and states that Gardner does not want to ban condoms. They clarify that Gardner believes in increased access to contraceptives and has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter. The ad's claim is based on Gardner's support of ""personhood"" measures that define life beginning at fertilization. Gardner co-sponsored a bill known as the Life At Conception Act, which declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, including at the moment of fertilization. Opponents of personhood legislation argue that it could make several FDA-approved contraceptives illegal. However, the article points out that even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, but there is still legal ambiguity. No state has passed a personhood measure, so the impact on specific types of contraceptives is unknown. The article also mentions that Gardner has changed his position on personhood during the 2014 campaign, stating that he no longer supports it because it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. He has also expressed support for allowing the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Gardner's campaign notes that he cosponsored an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specifically stated it would not prohibit the sale, use, prescription, or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug, or chemical.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The article discusses the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports in New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. These guidelines require anyone passing through the airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they are not showing symptoms, to be quarantined. The article mentions that these guidelines have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, who argue that they are unnecessary. The article also mentions that JFK, Newark, and O'Hare airports already have screening processes in place, along with three other American airports. Experts say that people who are not showing symptoms of Ebola are not contagious. The article then discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It states that Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia, Liberia, where he had been screened for Ebola. However, he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving in the United States. The article notes that it is unclear whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States, as American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola at that time. The article also mentions that airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been taking place since at least August. These screenings involve taking travelers' temperatures, answering health questionnaires, and visually assessing them for signs of illness. The article states that screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada, and now the United States. The article concludes by stating that the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines in early October for travelers from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports. These guidelines require travelers to go through an Ebola screening process, including temperature checks and questions about possible exposure. The article notes that even with these screening measures in place, it is possible that Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms. Overall, the article provides information about the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports and discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, who was the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States and mentions the existing airport screenings in West Africa and other countries.
Claim: Darrell Issa Says Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States ""with an elevated temperature.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
","
Darrell Issa, a Republican congressman from California, claimed that Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, came into the country with an elevated temperature. However, this claim is false. Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia, Liberia, where he had been screened for Ebola. It is unclear whether he had a fever when he arrived in the United States, as American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola at that time. Airport screenings in West Africa, like the one Duncan went through, have been taking place since at least August.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.
