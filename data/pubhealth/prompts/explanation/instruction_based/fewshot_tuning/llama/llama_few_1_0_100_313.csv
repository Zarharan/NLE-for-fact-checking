Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A study has found that people who have higher levels of vitamin D in their blood are less likely to die from cancer. The study analyzed data from 26 different studies involving over 17,000 cancer patients. The researchers found that people with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood had a 13% lower risk of dying from cancer. The study's findings were not conclusive, as the researchers could not establish a causal relationship between vitamin D levels and cancer survival. However, the researchers suggested that vitamin D may play a role in cancer survival by improving the immune system's ability to fight cancer cells. The researchers noted that the study had limitations, such as the lack of information on the participants' diet and lifestyle, which could have influenced the results. The researchers also acknowledged that the study's findings may not apply to all cancer types, as the data was limited to certain types of cancer.

1,1,11286,Stem cell experiment lets diabetics forgo insulin,"A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years. The main finding of the research is that the experimental treatment seems to cure diabetes in these patients. However, the broadcast fails to mention the cost of the procedure or project any potential costs. It does highlight the potential dangers of the procedure, such as infections resulting from the suppression of the immune system. The broadcast does not mention the possibility that the remarkable findings could be due to chance or bias, as pointed out by the researchers themselves. The findings will need to be validated through randomized studies that compare the new treatment to standard care or a placebo, and follow patients for a longer period of time. The broadcast does not explain this. There is no evidence of disease-mongering in the broadcast, as it presents a balanced view from cautious researchers, an academic ethicist, and a mother of a child with Type I diabetes. The broadcast also highlights the current standard of care for Type I diabetes, which involves insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It shows a young girl managing her disease through this routine, illustrating the hardships and discipline required. The broadcast emphasizes that the stem cell therapy is experimental and not widely available. While the broadcast suggests that this form of stem cell therapy is new, similar treatments for Type I diabetes have been experimented with since the 1990s. There is no obvious use of text from a press release in the broadcast.",true,"The NBC broadcast nicely contrasts the demands that glucose monitoring and insulin shots impose on Type I diabetes patients with the tremendous uncertainty associated with experimental stem cell treatments that might free patients from these daily routines. It summarizes the treatment’s apparent benefits and potential harms, as well as ethical concerns about exporting research on dangerous treatments to countries such as Brazil where patients may not fully understand the risks. If the broadcast has a weakness, it is that it fails to mention the limitations inherent in any small, nonrandomized, nonblinded study with short follow-up that investigates a new treatment in patients with a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. (See “Evidence” above.) Even if the treatments were relatively safe and conducted in the U.S., viewers should understand that such studies are awash in potential biases and should always be approached with caution.","A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years.

2,2,28668,Chinese people are selling each other bags of fresh air because of air pollution.,"The article discusses the issue of air pollution in China and how it has led to the sale of fresh air in various forms. It mentions that in February 2016, bottles of fresh air were being sold to Chinese customers as a relief from air pollution. The New York Times reported that Beijing officials listed smog as a natural disaster, causing controversy and concerns that it would reduce pressure on officials to fix the problem.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that a new study shows that marijuana can slow or halt the spread of HIV is a mixture of true and false. The article provides information on the study and its findings, but it also includes some false statements. The study found that marijuana compounds may suppress HIV in late-stage AIDS patients, but the compounds did not have any effect on healthy patients. The article also states that marijuana may help HIV patients live longer, but this is not supported by the study. The study was conducted on monkeys, and the results may not be applicable to humans. The article also includes a false statement about the legalization of marijuana in the United States, stating that it is legal in 18 states, when in fact it is only legal in 17 states. The article provides some valuable information on the study and its findings, but it also includes some false statements that should be taken with a grain of salt.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The video in question, which shows the aftermath of a school prank involving spiked lemonade, is not real. It was uploaded to the website LiveLeak in mid-September 2018 and gained millions of views on Facebook. However, the footage is actually taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal. The show is a satirical take on true crime documentaries and focuses on juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism in a high school setting. The second season of American Vandal, which premiered shortly before the viral video, features an episode called ""Brown Out."" In this episode, students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in Bellevue, Washington, are poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade and suffer from mass defecation. The opening sequence of this episode, which shows the students soiling themselves, was described as disgusting by The New Yorker. Some of the footage from the viral hoax video can also be seen in a trailer for the second season of American Vandal.

Context: The claim that a man was arrested for stealing $100 from a woman's purse is false. The claim was made by a website called The Last Line of Defense, which has a disclaimer stating that it is a satirical publication. The article about the man's arrest was published on the same day as another article about a woman being arrested for stealing $100 from a man's wallet, which also had a disclaimer stating that it was satire. The article about the man's arrest contains several red flags that suggest it is not a real news story. The article claims that the man was arrested by the FBI and that the woman who accused him of theft was a former Miss America.

6,6,8780,New antibody drug helps cells kill blood cancer.,"A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer. In a Phase I trial, all seven patients who received the highest dose of blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The drug works by binding cancer cells to cytotoxic T-cells, allowing them to effectively kill the tumor without causing uncontrolled T-cell activity. This is a significant breakthrough as scientists have struggled to find a way to trigger a T-cell attack against tumors. Micromet Inc, the company developing blinatumomab, hopes to conduct a pivotal clinical trial next year to gain regulatory approval. The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL. Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer. In a Phase I trial, all seven patients who received the highest dose of blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The drug works by binding cancer cells to cytotoxic T-cells, allowing them to effectively kill the tumor without causing uncontrolled T-cell activity. This is a significant breakthrough as scientists have struggled to find a way to trigger a T-cell attack against tumors. Micromet Inc, the company developing blinatumomab, hopes to conduct a pivotal clinical trial next year to gain regulatory approval. The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL. Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue. Overall, the results of the Phase I trial for blinatumomab in NHL are promising and provide hope for patients with previously incurable blood cancer. The drug's ability to activate T-cells in a controlled manner without causing excessive T-cell activity is a significant advancement in cancer treatment. Micromet Inc plans to conduct further clinical trials to gain regulatory approval for blinatumomab.

Context: The claim that a woman was sentenced to 30 days in jail for driving with a suspended license is false. The woman, 42-year-old Tanya McDowell, was convicted of first-degree larceny and sentenced to 12 years in prison for enrolling her son in a school district where she did not live. The sentence was harsher than that given to most first-time offenders and was criticized by some as excessive. The claim that McDowell was sentenced to 30 days in jail for driving with a suspended license is a misrepresentation of the facts. The driving charge was dismissed, and McDowell was convicted of larceny for stealing more than $15,000 in educational services from the school district.

However, the article explains that this claim is likely a classic urban legend. The article mentions that on June 20, 2015, a Facebook user shared a screenshot of a text message describing a harrowing near miss abduction effort that supposedly occurred in the bathroom of a Dillard's department store in Denton, Texas. The text message claimed that two girls hid in the bathroom, pinned down the daughter, and injected her with black laced heroin, paralyzing her. The two girls then claimed that the daughter was their drunk friend and they were taking her home. The post also mentioned that these two girls worked for sex trafficking in Denton. The article points out that this claim is similar to other messages spread on social media about kidnappers working on behalf of sex traffickers. These messages often lack verifiable documentation and rely on the ""friend of a friend"" narrative. The article mentions other instances of similar claims, such as a warning about abductors in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store and warnings about human traffickers targeting college kids through job interviews. Local police quickly responded to the claim and stated that they could not find any report to substantiate it. They considered it a rumor or hoax and continued to investigate. Facebook users commenting on the post by the City of Denton Police Department linked to an article about human trafficking raids in Denton. However, the police clarified that the article was from July 2014, indicating that it was not related to the recent claim. In summary, the claim of a teenage girl being drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working for sex traffickers is likely an urban legend.

Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted its supplemental application and granted priority review to Imfinzi for the treatment of previously untreated late-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The FDA decision is a boost for the treatment as it competes against similar medicines from rivals Merck and Roche, and follows data in September which showed Imfinzi prolonged survival in SCLC patients when used with chemotherapy. AstraZeneca has already carved out a niche for Imfinzi, which boosts the body’s immune system to fight cancer cells, in the more common cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with an existing approval for use in situations where tumors have only spread in the chest. The FDA in March approved Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq for the treatment of SCLC. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo is also approved in cases where patients fail at least two other treatments. A final decision to approve Imfinzi for SCLC is expected in the first quarter of 2020, AstraZeneca said.

Context: The claim that a 16-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet while riding in a car with her family is false. The incident occurred in Chicago, Illinois, where there have been 32 fatal shootings in the first two months of 2016, including that of a 2-year-old boy. The girl, identified as 16-year-old Sadaria Davis, was shot in the head and killed while riding in a car with her family. However, the circumstances surrounding her death are not entirely clear. The police have not released any information about the shooting, and the girl's family has not spoken publicly about the incident. The claim that Davis was killed by a stray bullet is based on speculation and is not supported by any evidence. It is possible that the shooting was intentional, or that the bullet was fired from a distance and did not hit its intended target.

11,11,22336,David Prosser Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.,"The article discusses a claim made by Justice David Prosser during a debate with his opponent, JoAnne Kloppenburg, for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Prosser stated that Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer in the state Department of Justice only involved the prosecution of cases regarding the regulation of docks. Prosser argued that his own experience as a district attorney and lawmaker made him more qualified for the position. The article examines the validity of Prosser's claim by looking at the cases handled by Kloppenburg during her time at the Department of Justice. Prosser's campaign provided evidence of 46 cases involving Kloppenburg, with 76% of them related to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). However, only five of these cases dealt directly with docks. The Kloppenburg campaign provided a list of 17 published decisions of cases she argued before the state Appeals Court, none of which involved docks. They also mentioned that Kloppenburg had argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts and before the state Supreme Court, with few, if any, involving docks or piers. Prosser later admitted that he was aware of the breadth of cases handled by Kloppenburg and that his comment about docks was a ""rhetorical flourish."" However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent Kloppenburg's record. Prosser's comment aligns with attacks from Kloppenburg's critics in the campaign, suggesting that it was not meant as a joke. In conclusion, the article finds that Prosser's claim about Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer is false.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed Friday to establish the SUNY Curing Alzheimer’s Health Consortium to collect and map genomic data statewide. The Democrat said the initiative will eventually provide the data to researchers working to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s. The governor says SUNY and the state’s economic development agency, Empire State Development, will seek proposals for private providers to work with SUNY, other hospitals and non-profit higher education research institutions on the mapping initiative. The Empire State Development’s life science initiative would provide $20 million in initial funding to identify and recruit 200,000 people for genetic testing. State health officials would help acquire samples and anonymized electronic health records of volunteers. More than 5 million people in the United States and millions more worldwide have Alzheimer’s, the leading cause of dementia. New York’s Department of Health estimates 390,000 individuals in New York had Alzheimer’s disease in 2017 — a figure expected to increase to 460,000 by 2025. Current drugs only temporarily ease symptoms and do not alter the course of the disease.

Context: The claim that the FDA has approved the first drug for treating peanut allergies in children is true. The drug, called Palforzia, is a powder that is mixed into other foods and is intended to be taken daily. The treatment is designed to help children build up a tolerance to peanut allergens, with the goal of preventing allergic reactions in the event of accidental exposure to peanuts. The FDA's approval of Palforzia is based on clinical trials that showed a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of allergic reactions in children who received the treatment compared to those who received a placebo. The trials also showed that children who received Palforzia were able to tolerate higher doses of peanut protein over time, indicating that the treatment was effective in building up tolerance. It is important to note that Palforzia is not a cure for peanut allergies, and children who receive the treatment will still need to avoid pe",What's true: New York Gov.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake.

14,14,6360,Judge: Treatment of Tennessee inmates with hep C improving.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160. The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment. Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider. The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases. Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population. Judge Crenshaw emphasized the importance of implementing the 2019 HCV Guidance and accelerating the approval of inmates for treatment to avoid future claims of inadequate treatment.",true,A federal judge in Nashville ruled this week that Tennessee’s treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C is not grossly inadequate but warned the state to make good on its promises to treat more patients more quickly.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C.

In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160. The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment. Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider. The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases. Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population. Judge Crenshaw emphasized the importance of implementing the 2019 HCV Guidance and accelerating the approval of inmates for treatment to avoid future claims of inadequate treatment.

Context: The claim that a new study has shown that eating meat causes cancer is false. The study in question was conducted by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which reviewed over 800 studies to assess the carcinogenicity of red meat and processed meat. The IARC classified processed meat as a carcinogen, and red meat as a probable carcinogen, based on limited evidence. However, this does not mean that eating meat causes cancer. The IARC's classification system is based on the strength of the evidence, not the size of the risk. The IARC's report states that eating 50 grams of processed meat every day increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent. This is a small increase in the absolute risk, as the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is 5 percent in the United States. The IARC's report also states that red meat has nutritional value, and the cancer risk associated with eating processed meat is small.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles.

Context: The treatment met the primary goals of the six-month, 24-patient trial by proving better than placebo at improving measures of cognitive function and global impression of change, the company said, although the study was too small to demonstrate statistical significance. “This was the first placebo-controlled clinical trial of Gammagard for Alzheimer’s disease, and the results are clearly promising,” Dr Norman Relkin said in a statement. Relkin presented the data at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in Chicago.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

19,19,12694,It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.,"U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, has been critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but opposed his party's health care plan. Yoho claims that the ACA has driven people to Medicaid, a program he describes as a worldwide failure.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.
Claim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.

20,20,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs. In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative.

DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs. In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative. The DCYF expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs, indicating that his concern about the expenditure of taxpayer dollars is valid.

Context: The claim that a 100-year-old man was able to walk out of a nursing home unnoticed and make his way to a bar is unproven. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the 100-year-old man resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The claim that the man was able to walk out of a nursing home unnoticed and make his way to a bar is unsupported by evidence. A search for incidents in the area yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot.

21,21,10103,"Antibiotics speed up recovery from ear infections in young children, studies show","Two studies have found that antibiotics can speed up recovery from ear infections in young children. The studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that children who were given antibiotics had a higher rate of symptom relief after 7 days compared to those who were given a placebo. The absolute rate of symptom relief was 80% for the antibiotic-treated patients and 74% for the placebo-treated patients. The studies also found that antibiotics were more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis. These findings support current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to children with ear infections. The article provides expert commentary on the benefits of antibiotics for ear infections, as well as the risks and likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don't receive antibiotics. It emphasizes the importance of putting the benefits of antibiotics into context and considering the risk of harm.

This CNN effort was better in most ways than the opinionated blog from the Washington Post. It earned points for sticking to the evidence and providing independent perspectives about the value of antibiotics for treating childhood ear infections. We also applaud the story’s focus on shared decision-making between doctors and parents when managing ear infections. A bit more detail on costs and harms would have added value to this excellent story. Wanting the best for a child with an ear infection doesn’t necessarily mean opting for the most aggressive treatment. As Dr Richard Rosenfeld puts it in this story: “Medicine is about gray zones and balancing the risks and benefits. Parents and doctors need to understand what the benefits and what the downside of treatments are.” While the research discussed here confirms that antibiotics are likely to be beneficial for certain children with ear infections, no study can take the place of a careful consideration of individual circumstances.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is competing for influence against the United States. Latin American nations, including Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and Peru, have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases in the region has climbed. China has donated masks, gloves, thermometers, and protective suits to these countries. The donations have been welcomed by the governments of these nations, highlighting China's efforts to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic. China's aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. China wants to be seen as a leader in the fight against the virus. The United States, on the other hand, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus. China's hands-on approach in Latin America has been well received. Chile has sought advice from Chinese health officials, Mexico is awaiting ventilators from China, and Panama has held video conferences with Chinese experts to work on strategy. Venezuela has received protective gear and test kits from China, and Brazil has healed a diplomatic rift with China and received assurances of medical supplies and technical assistance. Chinese firms, including Alibaba, Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction, and the Bank of China, have pledged donations to the region. The article also mentions that the US plans to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat the coronavirus and is considering additional donations.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The story fails to provide specific data about the mice used in the study. The story doesn't mention that the continual administration of sildenafil over many months is more similar to the way the drug is used in patients with pulmonary hypertension, rather than the occasional doses used to treat erectile dysfunction. The story doesn't interview any researchers or independent experts. The story doesn't provide information about how heart problems in patients with muscular dystrophy are currently managed or how sildenafil treatment compares to standard therapy. The story doesn't put the latest study in the proper context of other experiments. "

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

26,26,11330,Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk,"The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The study involved 899 participants who were followed for an average of 9 years. During the study, 99 people developed dementia, resulting in a total incidence of dementia of 11%. The article mentions that consuming two or more servings of fish per week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%. However, it notes that this is a relative risk reduction and does not provide the absolute risk of developing dementia, which would be necessary to put the relative risk reduction into context. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil, had a lower risk of developing dementia. Plasma DHA levels were seen to correlate with the number of servings of fish or the amount of DHA consumed. The article also mentions potential harms from fish oil consumption and speculates on potential harms from fish consumption. It suggests that other behaviors associated with reduced dementia, such as social activities or better dietary variety, may be more common in those who eat more fish, potentially confounding the results. The article points out that neither DHA nor fish oil supplements have FDA approval for the prevention of dementia. It also mentions that DHA is found in fatty fish and fish oil supplements, but curiously includes ""some meats"" as a source of DHA. However, DHA is primarily found in significant quantities in the brain, retina, and testes, which are not frequently consumed by people. Overall, the article reports on the findings of the study and includes quotes from the study's senior author and an editorial about the research. It does not appear to rely on a press release and does not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer's disease.",mixture,"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it is information that a reader should be aware of. The headline of the story – ""Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk"" – is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled ""Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease"" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease.

27,27,26287,"If masks prevent coronavirus, governors would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them.","The claim that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan, and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them is inaccurate. Medical experts agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the virus, and the states mentioned in the claim have distributed masks to inmates. Additionally, the claim suggests that all released inmates pose a threat to kill, which is an exaggeration. In response to the coronavirus, more inmates are being released from local jails than from prisons, and states are considering the potential danger to the public when deciding which inmates to release. In New York, pregnant women with nonviolent offenses and inmates held for low-level parole violations were released. Michigan is releasing nonviolent offenders over the age of 60 with health issues, and California is expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with less than 60 days left on their sentences.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

30,30,12749,On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. Williams initially stated that he would not seek life without parole for individuals under 18, but a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that his stance had changed. Williams responded with a letter to the editor, stating that his approach is consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court. The article explains that the issue of juvenile lifers became complicated when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision, which prohibited mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles, would apply retroactively. This led to a process of resentencing individuals across the state, with judges having the final determination on each case. The Inquirer reported that Williams' office intends to seek life without parole for at least three of the cases it has reviewed so far. Williams' chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, stated that while Williams hopes not to have many juvenile murderers remain in custody, there are certain circumstances, such as heinous crimes, where life without parole may be necessary. PolitiFact questioned whether this move conflicts with Williams' previous statements that all 300 individuals would have a chance at parole. Martin argued that the judge would have the final determination, but this contradicts what the DA's office is requesting. The article concludes by stating that Williams' original goal was to give all juvenile lifers some chance of parole, but in the most heinous cases, this goal may not be met. The DA's office argues that Williams' stance has not changed, as he always acknowledged that there could be exceptions. Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding Williams' stance on parole for juvenile lifers and the discrepancy between his previous statements and the actions of his office.",false,"District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.","Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim is that the House Democrats' stimulus package includes $335 million to fund prevention programs for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This claim has been widely cited by Republican leaders as a way to discredit the stimulus plan. The National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release criticizing 29 freshman House Democrats for supporting a spending plan that includes this funding. Republican Representative Eric Cantor also made this point in an interview with Fox News. The issue gained momentum after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it on its website. The article confirms that there is indeed STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats. The bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended this spending by stating that prevention measures are less expensive for states in the long run. The article also mentions that the Senate version of the bill includes slightly more funding for STD prevention. The Senate Appropriations committee approved a portion of the stimulus plan that states ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" The committee report justifies this spending by highlighting the high number of new STD infections in the United States and the preventable cost to the healthcare system. The article concludes by noting that while the $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis, which are not always transmitted sexually. Therefore, the claim that the stimulus package includes $335 million specifically for STD prevention programs is accurate, but it is important to recognize that the funding is allocated for a broader range of prevention programs as well.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers. However, the release lacks important information such as the cost of the drug compared to other asthma treatments currently in use. The release also fails to provide quantification of the results of the clinical tests and does not mention any potential side effects of the drug. The full research paper, which is behind a paywall, includes a table of adverse events experienced by patients in the study. The release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data regarding the reduction of eosinophil in sputum. However, it falls short in providing other indicators that would have strengthened it. The release includes funding sources but fails to mention any linkages between the study's authors and pharmaceutical firms, which is important for readers to ascertain bias. There is also no mention of alternative treatments for asthma or a comparison with current approaches. The release claims that the asthma pill is the first new one in nearly 20 years, but this is incorrect as several new drugs have come on the market in recent years. The release includes a conservative headline but allows the main researcher to proclaim the drug as a ""game changer"" and includes a testimonial from a study participant. The release also fails to include commentary from two unaffiliated experts, which would have improved its value.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A powerful earthquake struck the Turkey-Iran border region, resulting in the deaths of nine people and injuring over 100 others. Three of the deceased were children, and nine individuals are in critical condition. The quake caused over 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, leading to a rescue effort to find those trapped under the rubble. The tremor also damaged buildings in the Turkish city of Van and several villages in Iran. In Iran, 75 people were injured, with six requiring hospitalization. Following the initial earthquake, there were several aftershocks, including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude. No immediate reports of damage or casualties were received from the subsequent quake. Both Iran and Turkey are prone to earthquakes due to their location on major fault lines. Turkish TV footage showed people using shovels and their hands to dig through the rubble, while damaged buildings, fallen roofs, and cracked walls were observed in various villages. The governor of Van confirmed the loss of life and widespread destruction in the affected areas. The earthquake had a depth of 5 km and struck at 8:53 a.m. The second significant quake occurred at 7:00 p.m. Dozens of villages in Turkey were rattled, and nearly 150 tents were sent to provide shelter for affected families. The Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority initiated rescue operations in villages near the epicenter. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter to be 47 km west of the Iranian city of Khoy. Last month, another earthquake in eastern Turkey caused over 40 fatalities, while an earthquake in Iran caused structural damage to homes without resulting in any deaths. Rescue teams have been dispatched to the affected area in Iran's West Azarbaijan province, where several towns and villages suffered significant damage.

36,36,5367,TravelLab: Adults take over science museums when night falls.,"Science museums are hosting adult sleepovers, allowing grown-ups to explore the exhibits and learn about science in a unique and immersive way. The trend started at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which capitalized on the popularity of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. The sleepovers have become a hot ticket, with other science centers and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, and elsewhere following suit. During the sleepovers, guests have the opportunity to explore the museum's permanent exhibition halls, join guided tours, visit the planetarium, and meet with curators and museum scientists. The experience allows adults to experience the museum in a special way, without the crowds and rush of a typical visit during the day. The sleepovers also provide a chance for adults to have fun and embrace their inner child. Some attendees dress up in dinosaur costumes or onesies, adding to the playful atmosphere. The sleepovers typically include dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and guests can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum's cots, located below a 94-foot-long blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The sleepovers also have a scientific purpose. The quiet and stillness of the nighttime environment allows visitors to better absorb and learn from the exhibits. Biologist John Karavias explains that during the day, visitors often feel rushed and only get superficial reactions to the exhibits. At night, however, the background noise is quieted down, allowing visitors to digest the science behind what they are seeing. The sleepovers also provide an opportunity for museum staff to educate guests about important scientific topics.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization has found that among 73 lower and middle-income nations, only four have adequate resources in place to provide necessary care for women and newborns. The four countries are Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Jordan. The review states that more than three-quarters of the countries face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, relieving pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths, and 289,000 maternal deaths, with over 92 percent of these deaths occurring in the countries reviewed. Many of these countries lack the necessary infrastructure and regulatory systems to train midwives adequately. Data collection is also a problem. The report emphasizes the importance of women and girls' right to maternal and reproductive health and calls for a change in the current situation. The lack of midwifery services is not only a health crisis but also an economic one. Boosting midwifery services can reduce costly cesarean births, saving up to $128.5 million over three decades. Bangladesh is one country that has made some progress in training midwives, although birth-related mortality remains high. The report is part of the UN and WHO's larger effort to boost access to midwives by 2030. The report was funded by the UN, the U.S. and Canadian governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, and other groups.

Context: The claim that the US government has been running a secret mind control program for decades is not supported by evidence. The claim is based on the testimony of a former CIA officer, John Kiriakou, who says that the program was started by the CIA in the 1950s and continued until the 1970s. However, Kiriakou's account is contradicted by the fact that the CIA has admitted to conducting mind control experiments in the past and has released documents related to the program. The CIA's MK-ULTRA program, which was active from the 1950s to the 1970s, involved experiments on human subjects without their consent, including the use of drugs and other methods to manipulate their behavior. The program was exposed in the 1970s and led to the creation of the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee, which investigated the CIA's activities.",What's true: 72 of the 73 lower and middle-income countries reviewed lack adequate resources to provide necessary care for women and newborns.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The UK government has enlisted firefighters to assist in the response to the coronavirus crisis. Under a deal struck between the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), fire chiefs, and Fire and Rescue Employers, firefighters will continue to respond to emergencies but will also carry out new tasks. These tasks include collecting bodies in the event of mass casualties, driving ambulances, and delivering food and medicine to vulnerable individuals. The move comes as the UK has implemented stringent controls to prevent the spread of the virus, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordering a virtual lockdown of the country. As of now, there have been 578 deaths and 11,658 confirmed cases in the UK. The country currently has the seventh highest death toll in the world. To cope with the outbreak, the UK has asked retired doctors and healthcare workers to return to work, and hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered to assist the National Health Service. The capital's ambulance service and police force have also appealed to former staff to come back and help. However, there has been criticism that the government has been slow in providing protective equipment to frontline healthcare staff, and it is also struggling to source enough ventilators to treat severe breathing problems caused by the virus. The government has admitted that it missed an opportunity to join a European Union procurement scheme for equipment due to a communication issue. Despite these challenges, Britons have shown support for healthcare workers by applauding them from their balconies and front doors.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles.

Context: President Donald Trump claimed during a virtual town hall with Fox News that former Vice President Joe Biden had written a letter of apology for calling Trump's travel restrictions from China ""xenophobic."" However, there is no evidence to support this claim. Biden's campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, stated that it ""never happened."" There is no public record of any letter of apology from Biden on Twitter, Google, or the Nexis news archive database. Other fact-checkers and political reporters have also concluded that no such letter exists. On January 31, the Trump administration announced temporary travel restrictions from China due to the coronavirus outbreak. Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, later expressed Biden's support for these restrictions in a statement to CNN on April 3. However, Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic. In a campaign event on January 31, Biden criticized Trump's ""hysterical xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration's policy. He emphasized the need for science to guide the response to the crisis. Biden has used the word ""xenophobic"" in reference to Trump on multiple occasions, but not directly in relation to the China travel policy. An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like he complimented Trump for the travel restrictions. However, in the full context, Biden was actually criticizing Trump for not acting urgently enough. In conclusion, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that Biden wrote a letter of apology for calling the travel restrictions xenophobic. Biden's campaign spokesman denied the existence of such a letter, and there is no public record of it. While Biden has used the word ""xenophobic"" to describe Trump, it was not directly in reference to the China travel policy.

42,42,3386,New York tries to keep alive flavored e-cigarette ban.,"The state of New York is attempting to extend its ban on flavored e-cigarettes for another 90 days. The ban, which went into effect in September, prohibits the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, with the exception of menthol and tobacco flavors. The state's Public Health and Health Planning Council voted to renew the regulations, citing concerns about the health risks of vaping and its popularity among teenagers. The ban was initially blocked by a state appeals court in October, but the council wants to ensure that the emergency regulations remain in place if the courts uphold the ban. The Department of Health spokesperson expressed confidence that the court will recognize the public health emergency and the need for immediate action. The ban has faced criticism from opponents, including the Vapor Technology Association, who argue that it is government overreach and will harm small businesses and adult smokers who use flavors to quit. Supporters, such as the American Cancer Society's advocacy group, are pushing for the ban to be made permanent and for all flavored tobacco to be prohibited. Governor Andrew Cuomo has also expressed his intention to expand the ban to include menthol. Anti-tobacco and anti-vaping groups argue that there is no scientific basis for exempting menthol and that it has been unethically marketed towards African Americans. They also warn that mint and menthol flavors can still attract young people to e-cigarettes by masking the harshness of nicotine. In addition to the state ban, New York City Council has passed its own bill banning flavored vaping products, including menthol, which is expected to take effect in July 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported over 2,400 cases of lung illnesses and 52 deaths nationwide attributed to vaping, with laboratory findings suggesting that products containing vitamin E or THC have played a major role in the outbreak.",true,"New York’s ban on flavored e-cigarettes is still held up in court, but a state council voted Thursday to keep it alive in case the judge rules in the state’s favor.","The state of New York is attempting to extend its ban on flavored e-cigarettes for another 90 days.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has failed to reduce healthcare costs for Americans is false. The ACA has resulted in significant reductions in healthcare costs for individuals, families, and the government. The average prem","The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs on Monday added 11 medical conditions deemed debilitating by the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act of 2008. They are: arthritis, autism, chronic pain, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal cord injury, Tourette’s syndrome and ulcerative colitis. Denied conditions include anxiety, asthma, brain injury, panic attacks, depression and diabetes. Existing entries on the list include post-traumatic stress disorder, cancer, glaucoma, HIV, AIDS, Crohn’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and severe and chronic pain. Officials say they received public comments related to petitions to add conditions to the list.

The claim is supported by various news reports and accounts from healthcare officials and leaders. The article mentions Dr. Andrew W.

He stated that before he could send the funds for the shipment, two FBI agents arrived and questioned him. After assuring them that the PPE was intended for hospitals, the agents allowed the equipment to be released. However, the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting the supplies, but intervention from a congressional representative prevented their seizure. The Los Angeles Times also reported that healthcare officials in seven states claimed that the federal government seized their PPE shipments without providing guidance on when or if they would receive the supplies they ordered. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that FEMA intervened in a deal the city had with a supplier to buy 1 million masks. A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The US Air Force already has a space command, and there are concerns that creating a separate Space Force would duplicate efforts and increase costs.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The total number of deaths in Italy due to the coronavirus has risen to 107, with 28 deaths occurring in the past 24 hours. As a result, the Education Minister has announced the closure of all schools and universities in the country from Thursday until at least March 15. Previously, only schools in the heavily affected northern regions had been closed. The number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to 3,089, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.5%. The government has implemented a decree to slow down the spread of the virus, which includes the suspension of events that involve large gatherings of people and the closure of cinemas and theaters. Italians are also advised to avoid physical contact with others, including shaking hands and hugging. Major sporting events, including Serie A soccer matches, will be played in empty stadiums. The closure of schools has received mixed reactions from parents, with some expressing relief to prevent the spread of the virus among children, while others find it tragic for both students and parents. The virus outbreak is primarily concentrated in the Lombardy region, but cases are spreading throughout the country. The economic impact of the outbreak is significant, with the tourist sector experiencing a wave of cancellations.

49,49,1382,Regulator grants license for Britain's first three-parent IVF babies.,"The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK has granted a license to a team of doctors in Newcastle to carry out the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique, which could result in the birth of the first child created in Britain using this method by the end of the year. The technique involves removing faulty mitochondria, which can cause serious health problems, from embryos and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a female donor. This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor. The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues. The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases. The UK has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debates regarding pro-nuclear transfer techniques. However, it is not the first country to have children born using three-parent IVF treatment, as the world's first known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 with the help of US doctors at a clinic in Mexico. Critics of the treatment argue that it is a dangerous step that could lead to the creation of genetically modified ""designer babies."" Nevertheless, fertility specialists have praised the decision, with one calling it a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome. The license was granted following a change in the law last year that allowed the treatment to be carried out once it was ready for licensing. The HFEA will still need to approve each clinic and patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be performed.

The incident was captured on video by the farm's owner, who had set up a camera after suspecting that someone was abusing his horses. Romero was charged with three counts of sexual contact with an animal, but the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence. However, Romero was convicted of trespassing and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The sentence was based on his prior criminal record, which included a previous conviction for lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12 years old.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The State Department Office of Inspector General (OIG) has recommended that two U.S. agencies, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Counter-terrorism, stop sending specially trained dogs to Jordan and Egypt until measures are in place to ensure their well-being. The agencies have agreed to this recommendation and claim to have taken actions to protect the dogs. The OIG had previously released a report in September expressing concerns about the health and welfare of dogs deployed to Jordan, the largest recipient of dogs in the explosive-detection program. The report found that several dogs had died or had to be euthanized in the past 18 months, with causes including heat stroke, a preventable parasite, and pesticide exposure. Jordan has agreed to stop using the pesticide around the kennels. A veterinarian consulted by the OIG stated that the heat stroke deaths were a result of negligence and improper care. In Egypt, at least three dogs have died, including one from heat stroke, and officials have refused to allow State Department personnel to visit the kennels or the airport where the dogs work. The Bureau of Counter-terrorism and Bureau of Diplomatic Security have informed the OIG that they are providing additional equipment and training to host country handlers and veterinarians. Neither Jordan nor Egypt has provided immediate comment on the report. The State Department has sent over 200 dogs to various countries over the past 20 years to help prevent terrorism. The OIG's report serves as an update after investigators discovered ongoing problems and additional deaths.

52,52,30728,"The world suicide rate plummeted following Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video.","The claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is not true. The claim originated from a fake news website called Huzlers, which is known for publishing satirical and fictional stories. The website itself states that it is a fake news and satire entertainment website. Therefore, the claim is not based on factual information. Furthermore, the world suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, so it would be impossible to determine if Paul's video had any impact on the suicide rate within a few days.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

55,55,10570,Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality,"A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device. The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators. The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing. It also emphasizes the need for further trials before there is enough evidence to apply for FDA approval. The trials of the new device were funded by the manufacturer, and the lead researcher is the founder of the company. The report includes an independent source, which adds credibility to the information presented. It is important to note that the new device does not offer the heart pacemaker function that some existing implantable defibrillators have.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.
Claim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.

The claim is based on a video that shows a woman sticking metal objects to her arm after receiving the vaccine. However, the video has been debunked as a hoax, and there is no scientific evidence to support the claim. The vaccine does not contain any magnetic materials, and the human body does not have the ability to generate a magnetic field. The claim that the vaccine can make you magnetic is dangerous because it could discourage people from getting vaccinated, which could lead",What's true: Texting while driving is a dangerous behavior that can lead to accidents and fatalities. What's false: Texting while driving has not surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that a woman was fined $500 for wearing Google Glass while driving is true. The woman, Cecilia Abadie, was pulled over for speeding and was issued a ticket for wearing Google Glass while driving. The ticket was issued under a California law that prohibits driving with a monitor in the driver's view. The law was originally intended to prevent drivers from watching television while driving, but it also applies to Google Glass. Abadie is contesting the ticket and has filed a motion to dismiss the charge. She argues that Google Glass is not a monitor under the law and that it does not obstruct her view while driving. The case is still ongoing, and it is unclear whether Abadie will be successful in her challenge.

59,59,7685,China expands switch from polluting coal heating in 2018: environment minister.,"China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie. Last year, 4.8 million households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity, up from 4 million households in 2017. China's winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal annually, and converting to low-emission heating was seen as a key part of the country's fight against pollution. Additionally, China has implemented ultra-low emissions technology in over 80 percent of its coal-fired power generation capacity. However, Li Ganjie warned that despite the progress made in 2018, China's battle against smog is becoming more challenging. He stated that the easy tasks have already been completed, and the remaining tasks are more difficult. While China reduced the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent in 2018, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, Li Ganjie believes it is still too high. He also mentioned regional disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection measures. China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry is determined to continue its efforts to curb pollution. However, concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 increased over the winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities rising by 13 percent from October to February. In response to these challenges, China announced that it would implement special emissions restrictions for the third consecutive winter.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

61,61,2703,Consumer goods CEOs in Davos hot seat over plastic waste.,"At the World Economic Forum in Davos, CEOs of consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and PepsiCo have faced criticism and pressure over their handling of plastic waste, similar to how coal and oil chiefs were scrutinized over climate change in previous years. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan compared the situation to the coal industry, stating that these companies are trying to avoid regulation. The CEOs at Davos have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging through various initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme. However, Greenpeace argues that recycling is not enough and calls for plastic packaging bans and a goal of ""peak plastic."" The issue of plastic waste has gained prominence due to alarming statistics, such as 8 million tonnes of plastic being dumped into the oceans each year, causing harm to marine life and entering the food chain. The CEOs of Unilever and PepsiCo have acknowledged the urgency of the issue and have made commitments to reduce plastic packaging. Unilever, for example, promised in 2017 to ensure that all of its plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. Several companies, including Carrefour, Tesco, PepsiCo, and Unilever, have signed up for a pilot waste-reduction program unveiled at Davos, which involves delivering products in reusable bottles and collecting them for cleaning and re-use. The plastic debate has also caught the attention of the insurance industry, with Swiss Re's CEO stating that if companies face lawsuits for their plastic waste, it could impact their ability to obtain insurance coverage. Greenpeace's call for more bans on plastic packaging was met with resistance from Unilever and PepsiCo, who argue that the issue requires multiple solutions, including recycling, re-use, and new packaging technologies. The European Union recently passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items by 2021, but Greenpeace called for further reduction targets. Greenpeace and other critics argue that industry initiatives alone are not enough to solve the plastic waste problem, as many companies are expanding production of single-use plastic. French Secretary of State for Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy, Brune Poirson, criticized the companies for not taking enough initiative and stated that government intervention is necessary.",true,"Consumer products companies including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) are emerging as new targets for global activism, with green groups blaming them for fouling the ocean with plastic and activists urging governments to regulate them.","At the World Economic Forum in Davos, CEOs of consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and PepsiCo have faced criticism and pressure over their handling of plastic waste, similar to how coal and oil chiefs were scrutinized over climate change in previous years.

The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The article states that a study published in 2012 demonstrated the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brains of women who had been examined in autopsy. This phenomenon is known as microchimerism and is typically attributed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy. The study did not mention sexual intercourse as a mechanism for the transfer of male cells. The article also mentions a 2005 paper that showed the presence of male cells in women who had never given birth to males. However, this paper only speculates on the possibility of male DNA being detected in a woman's circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy, and it has not been studied further.

The law does not make it illegal to insult a cop, but rather to use violence or threats against a police officer. The law specifically targets individuals who use violence or threats against police officers, such as throwing objects at them or using force to resist arrest. It also extends to those who use social media to incite violence against police officers. The law does not apply to individuals who simply insult a police officer, as this is protected by freedom of speech. However, the law does provide for stiffer penalties for those who use violence or threats against police officers, with sentences ranging from one to five years in prison and fines of up to €75,000.

However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.
Claim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.

### Response:
We contacted police in Hickory, North Carolina, to determine whether they’re aware of any incidents at Walmart (or elsewhere) matching the example above. According to the department, no reports of attempted abductions or unwanted solicitations in local parking lots had been received.

Context: French prosecutors have opened an investigation into Monsanto, the agrochemical company now owned by Bayer, following a complaint filed by daily newspaper Le Monde. The complaint alleges that Monsanto compiled a file of around 200 names, including journalists and lawmakers, in an attempt to influence their positions on pesticides. The file, which dates back to 2016, was leaked by US public relations and marketing agency FleishmanHillard. Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, declined to comment on the investigation, stating that it did not know which documents the allegations referred to. The company emphasized its commitment to openness and fair treatment of all interest groups, as well as compliance with data privacy regulations. FleishmanHillard has stated that it will investigate the allegations made in Le Monde. The company plans to examine the questions raised by certain media outlets regarding the lists of stakeholders, which it claims included publicly available information. Bayer is currently facing numerous lawsuits over its weedkiller Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. In August 2018, a US jury found the company liable for not warning users about the alleged cancer risks associated with Roundup. Last month, Bayer suffered another defeat in a similar case, and over 13,000 plaintiffs are now seeking damages. The company has stated that it intends to defend itself in all lawsuits.
Claim: Bayer says won't tolerate unethical behavior as France probes Monsanto file.
The claim veracity: true

### Response:

What's true: Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says it will investigate allegations that Monsanto compiled a file of journalists and lawmakers in an attempt to influence their positions on pesticides. What's false: The file is not a ""Monsanto file,"" and it's unclear if it was compiled to influence positions on pesticides.

65,65,11409,Study finds computers hinder accuracy in mammography,"A study has found that the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) in mammography may hinder accuracy rather than improve it. The article mentions that the cost of using CAD adds about $20 to the cost of each mammogram, but this charge is covered by Medicare and most insurers. It also states that medical centers have invested between $125,000 and $175,000 in these machines. The benefits of CAD technology were reported in terms of the absolute number of tumors detected. However, the article points out that the harm of unnecessary biopsies was mentioned, but the increased number of biopsies was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute value. It suggests that the use of CAD may increase the number of cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which may not pose a health risk during a woman's lifetime. The benefit of cancer treatment for women with this diagnosis is therefore unclear. The article acknowledges that the evidence presented in the study showed no difference in breast cancer detection rates when using CAD. It also mentions that the source of the study was included in the story, and multiple sources were used, some directly involved in the study and some not. The article does not engage in disease mongering.

As was reported in the story, the study found that the use of CAD actually reduced the accuracy of the breast cancer screening. The story included technical detail about how CAD is used and made important points about the real value of experienced mammographers. It covered costs – the additional cost of computer detection and of the machines. And it turned to several sources – some involved in the study and some not. The story might have helped women with a few more questions. What should a woman do with this information? Should she go to a facility that uses computer-aided detection? Should she ask that it not be used? Are there other things she should do to make sure that her screening is a high quality as possible?

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials.

66,66,644,Climate change endangers Scotland's archaeological treasures.,"Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change. With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change. A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970. Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change. With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change. A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970. Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers. In 2018, it attracted 112,000 visitors. HES climate change scientist David Harkin emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and protect these archaeological treasures. He acknowledges that climate change is already happening and that the pace of change will accelerate. However, he also believes that there is an opportunity to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and avoid the destruction of sites like Skara Brae. In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to Scotland's archaeological treasures on the Orkney Islands. Erosion, increased precipitation, rising sea levels, beach erosion, and storminess are all contributing to the deterioration of these historical sites. Urgent action is needed to protect and preserve these valuable cultural heritage sites.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government is spraying chemicals in the atmosphere to control the weather is not supported by evidence. The claim originated from a 1996 U.S. Air Force research paper on weather modification, which was cited in a 2005 book titled ""Chemtrails Confirmed."" However, the research paper was intended for a general audience and did not represent an operational capability. The U.S. Air Force has not conducted any weather modification programs or experiments since 1992, and there is no evidence to suggest that the government is spraying chemicals in the atmosphere. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of the research paper and lacks any concrete evidence to support it.

67,67,10900,Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery,"A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery. Atrial fibrillation after surgery can lead to longer hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. The study involved 60 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either botulinum toxin or saline injections. The results showed that there were no additional complications from the Botox injections compared to the saline group. However, more details about the study, such as baseline differences between the groups and the number of vessels engrafted, were not provided. The funding sources for the study were noted as The Russian State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology and the Siberian Division of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. The article also mentions that other attempts have been made to reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery using different drugs, but with varying results. It is noted that botulinum toxin is already available and used in cosmetic dermatology under the trade name Botox Cosmetic. However, this is the first time it has been tested in human hearts, so it may take several years before it receives approval as a preventative for heart complications. The article concludes by stating that larger studies are needed to further investigate the potential benefits of botulinum toxin in preventing atrial fibrillation after bypass surgery.",true,"This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: In rare cases, getting your hair washed at a beauty salon can increase the chances of having a stroke. This condition, known as Beauty Parlor Stroke Syndrome, occurs when the neck is hyperextended and the vertebrae slice an artery, causing a clot to form and later leading to a stroke. Older people have a higher risk of experiencing a stroke during or after a visit to the salon. A study from 1993 found that four out of five patients suffered strokes leading to permanent neurologic damage. Neck motion beyond a certain degree, such as hyperextension and rotation, can be extremely dangerous for older individuals. Anesthesia or prolonged dental work can also make patients vulnerable to this condition. A 2006 study suggested that changing the shampoo routine from a hanging head position to a flexed or neutral position can prevent this risk. While this injury is uncommon, it has been seen in other situations such as surfing, dental visits, and even falling asleep in a movie theater. Signs to watch for after a potential injury include pain on one side of the neck after extension and neurologic symptoms like vertigo. People with genetic disorders or connective tissue diseases may be more prone to this condition. Elizabeth Smith, a woman who suffered a stroke after getting her hair washed at a salon, is now suing the salon for damages. She wants to raise awareness about the condition and debunk the skepticism that people may feel nothing when the injury occurs. The delay from injury to stroke is due to a small bleed that takes time for the body to build a clot big enough to cause damage. Smith hopes that her story will help others understand the risks associated with getting their hair washed at a salon.

The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and five months later, the agency responded with a letter to Tvedten, ordering him to cease and desist the construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

70,70,10611,Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise,"A recent article titled ""Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise"" discusses a new experimental treatment for peanut allergies that has shown positive results in early studies. The article mentions that the treatment has been tested on a small number of patients, with most of them showing improved resistance to peanut allergens. Five patients were able to tolerate peanuts without any reaction, while four had to withdraw from the study due to intolerance to the treatment. The article also mentions that the second test involved splitting the subjects into treatment and placebo groups, with approximate outcomes for each group described. However, the article is criticized for not providing enough information about the methodology and outcomes of the studies. It is noted that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and the study groups were very small, consisting of only 33 and 18 subjects. The article should have made it clear from the beginning that the evidence is of low quality and that more study is needed. The article also fails to provide a sufficient warning about potential harms and the need for close medical supervision. It is mentioned in the last line that parents should not try the approach at home, but this warning should have appeared earlier. Additionally, the article does not mention whether those who did not tolerate the treatment required any intervention to quell allergic reactions. The only source quoted in the article is Dr. Wesley Burks of Duke University Medical Center, one of the researchers involved in the study. However, it is not disclosed that Burks has financial relationships with companies related to allergies. The article should have included an additional source with no connection to the research. The article does mention that there are no approved treatments for food allergies and that the experimental treatment for peanut allergy is in the early stages of human research. However, it is suggested that this information should have been made clearer earlier in the story. Lastly, the article states that nearly half of the deaths attributed to food allergies in the United States each year are caused by peanut allergies, according to Duke University. However, there is a minor discrepancy between the article and a Duke University press release regarding the inclusion of the words ""in the United States."" Overall, the article highlights the promising results of the experimental treatment for peanut allergies but is criticized for its lack of detail, failure to provide sufficient warnings, and the need for more study.",true,"This story on an experimental desensitization treatment for peanut allergies oversells the promise of the research and the importance of the studies.

But its main problem is that the reporter lets the ""good news"" [that studies suggest a new regimen may be effective against a serious condition] linger far too long before getting to the ""bad news"" [the studies are unpublished, preliminary, small, brief and inconclusive]. The lede gets in trouble early when it says the treatment ""raises the possibility of a cure for this potentially life-threatening condition."" In the next paragraph it conveys a lead researcher’s assertion that a treatment ""may be developed in two or three years."" Only later come the reminders that these are small pilot studies. This is a common pattern in news reporting: Run with the promise, and let the caveats catch up by the end of the story.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A recent article titled ""Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise"" discusses a new experimental treatment for peanut allergies that has shown positive results in early studies. The article mentions that the treatment has been tested on a small number of patients, with most of them showing improved resistance to peanut allergens. Five patients were able to tolerate peanuts without any reaction, while four had to withdraw from the study due to intolerance to the treatment. The article also mentions that the second test involved splitting the subjects into treatment and placebo groups, with approximate outcomes for each group described. However, the article is criticized for not providing enough information about the methodology and outcomes of the studies. It is noted that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and the study groups were very small, consisting of only 33 and 18 subjects. The article should have made it clear from the beginning that the evidence is of low quality and that more study is needed.

71,71,14192,"Cervical cancer in Africa is ""fully preventable with basic education, screening and vaccines.","The article discusses Vice President Joe Biden's call for a ""moonshot"" to cure cancer and his statement that nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable. Specifically, Biden mentions cervical cancer in Africa as being fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. However, the article argues that while cervical cancer is highly preventable, it is not fully preventable in Africa due to various challenges. The article cites a fact-sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which states that in the United States, 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination.

The article highlights the high incidence of cervical cancer in Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

72,72,4447,New genetic links to same-sex sexual behavior found.,"A genome-wide research study on DNA from nearly half a million U.S. and U.K. adults has identified five genetic variants that were more common in people who reported ever having had a same-sex sexual partner.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

74,74,16759,North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final.,"The article discusses a YouTube video that appears to be a North Korean news broadcast previewing the final match of the 2014 World Cup. The video suggests that North Korea's team made it to the final and will face Portugal. However, the video is actually a fake and was created by an anonymous producer of the YouTube channel Korea News Backup. The article mentions that some bloggers and journalists believed that North Korea was trying to deceive its citizens with this video. However, the video is clearly a spoof and not an actual news broadcast. The article also addresses the reasons why the North Korean government would be unlikely to attempt such a stunt. Firstly, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the World Cup games, although not live. Additionally, most North Koreans would be aware that their team failed to qualify for the World Cup two years prior. The article quotes experts who explain that making it to the final would be impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds. The article also highlights some examples of creative license exercised by the North Korean government. For instance, the official biography of the previous leader, Kim Jong Il, claimed that he was born on Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

75,75,1308,Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned of shortages as more than 1.5 million Americans have received the vaccine since the end of last year. GSK has increased deliveries significantly and is vaccinating people against shingles at a faster rate than before, but it is struggling to keep up with the high demand. The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck's older and less effective vaccine, leading to strong demand. Consensus forecasts predict peak annual sales for Shingrix of around £1.5 billion ($2 billion), but Exane BNP analysts believe this estimate may be too low. They suggest sales could rise to £3 billion if Shingrix achieves market penetration rates of around 60%, similar to Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. In its first full quarter on the market, Shingrix achieved sales of £110 million, and GSK expects 2018 sales to exceed £400 million. Shingrix is a key product for GSK CEO Emma Walmsley as she aims to improve the company's commercial performance and demonstrate the profit potential of GSK's vaccines business. GSK has already achieved its mid-term goal of reaching vaccine margins of 30%, and Exane BNP believes it could reach 35% by 2020 with the introduction of Shingrix and other premium vaccines. Shingrix is administered in two doses, while Merck's Zostavax is a single shot. Ensuring patients adhere to the two-shot regimen will be crucial in maximizing the vaccine's sales potential. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which is also responsible for chickenpox. The virus lies dormant in the nervous system of nearly all adults over 50, putting them at risk of shingles as they age.",true,"GlaxoSmithKline is facing “unprecedented” demand for its new shingles vaccine Shingrix, suggesting the product could be a bigger money-spinner than the company and analysts initially thought.","GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that a group of people in the United States were arrested for praying in a public park is false. The incident occurred in a park in the city of Hialeah, Florida, where a group of people were praying and playing music. The group was approached by a police officer who informed them that they were in violation of a city ordinance that prohibits the use of amplified sound in public parks. The officer asked the group to turn off the music, and when they refused, he issued them a citation for violating the ordinance. The group was not arrested or charged with any criminal offense. The incident was captured on video and shared widely on social media, with many people claiming that the group was arrested for praying. However, the video and other evidence clearly show that the group was cited for violating the noise ordinance, not for praying. The city of Hialeah has since clarified that the ordinance is intended to prevent excessive noise in public parks and that it does not prohibit prayer or other religious activities.",What's true: The Rev. William Barber II urged Gov. Bill Lee to act on poverty and other issues at an MLK Day event in Nashville. What's false: Lee was not at the event and did not respond to Barber's comments. 
79,79,25422,A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.,"The article discusses a claim made by Hillary Clinton during a campaign speech in Shenandoah, Iowa. Clinton argued that the federal government is not adequately protecting the public due to insufficient inspections of toys and food. She used the example of a ham and cheese sandwich to illustrate her point, stating that a sandwich on one slice of bread falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which conducts daily inspections of manufacturers. However, a sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only inspects manufacturers about once every five years. To verify Clinton's claim, the article refers to government reports on food safety, interviews with the head of the USDA's food inspection service, and the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. It confirms that Clinton's example is correct, highlighting the significant disparity in inspections conducted by the two agencies. Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged the absurdity of the sandwich rule and admitted that it defies logic. However, he stated that the rule does not impact the safety of the nation's food supply. The article explains that the distinction between USDA and FDA jurisdiction over sandwiches can be traced back to Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, published in 1906. The book exposed horrific conditions in meat plants and led to the enactment of a law requiring meat inspections. Since then, the USDA has focused on meat and poultry inspections, while other foods fall under the FDA's purview. The FDA, however, does not have a mandate for regular inspections, and a report by the Government Accountability Office confirms that the agency inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years on average. Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, criticizes the current food safety system, stating that it is based on antiquated laws and divided agencies. She argues that the lack of regular inspections and insufficient funding for the FDA puts the public at risk. These concerns are echoed in a report from an FDA advisory panel, which states that the agency is overburdened and underfunded, making it unable to effectively conduct routine surveillance of the nation's food supply.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: Members of the Democratic state ticket in Virginia have labeled their Republican opponents as extremists, claiming that their top priority is to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control. The claim was made by Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, during a campaign rally in Richmond. McAuliffe's campaign pointed to a comment made by Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli at a rally in 2012, where he advocated for personhood legislation. However, the Truth-O-Meter fact-checking website argues that this comment is not relevant to the claim at hand. While it is clear that the GOP ticket opposes abortion, there is no evidence that they have proclaimed ending abortion and restricting birth control as their top priority. Cuccinelli has stated that his top priority is the economy and job creation. McAuliffe's campaign also provided snippets of other comments made by Cuccinelli, where he expressed his opposition to abortion, but again, these fall short of a declaration of their top priority. The article concludes that while it is likely that the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and potentially ban certain types of birth control, McAuliffe's claim goes beyond what has been stated by his opponents.

Context: The claim that the US Army has confirmed the existence of a new type of energy weapon that can destroy multiple targets at once is true. The weapon, known as the High Energy Laser Tactical Vehicle Demonstrator (HEL TVD), was developed by the Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) and successfully destroyed multiple targets during a test in December 2021. The HEL TVD is a 300-kilowatt laser mounted on a Stryker combat vehicle that can engage multiple targets simultaneously, providing a new capability for the Army. The laser has been in development for several years and is part of the Army's efforts to modernize its weapons systems and stay ahead of potential adversaries. The HEL TVD is expected to undergo further testing and development in the coming years.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland.

82,82,1972,Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.,"A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s. The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine. According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption. The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat.

The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s. The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine. According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption. The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.

The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision. He stated that they will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by the product. Echeverria had alleged that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential cancer risks associated with their talcum powder.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, Maren Nelson, has granted Johnson & Johnson's request for a new trial, overturning a $417 million award that was given to a woman who claimed that the company's talcum powder caused her ovarian cancer. The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision. He stated that they will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by the product. Echeverria had alleged that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential cancer risks associated with their talcum powder. She had used the company's baby powder daily from the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007. Her attorney argued that documents showed that the company had known about the risks for decades. Johnson & Johnson expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating that ovarian cancer is not caused by the cosmetic-grade talc used in their baby powder. They emphasized that they will continue to defend the safety of their product as they prepare for additional trials in the United States. The company has faced numerous similar allegations, resulting in hundreds of lawsuits and jury awards totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. However, a Missouri appellate court recently overturned a $72 million award to the family of a woman who had died, ruling that the state was not the proper jurisdiction for the case. The court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that limited where injury lawsuits could be filed, stating that state courts cannot hear claims against companies not based in the state where the alleged injuries occurred.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article discusses the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti, who have lost limbs as a result of the devastating earthquake that struck the country in 2010. The players, who train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti's largest slum, faced off in a match on the anniversary of the earthquake as a commemoration of the disaster. Many people in Haiti lost limbs in the earthquake, and the players have received treatment, athletic training, and prosthetic limbs through a program funded by Miami's Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus. Over 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs so far, with hundreds more set to begin treatment in the coming weeks and months. Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, there is a sense of pessimism and despair in Haiti. The country was already impoverished before the earthquake, with 70% of the population living on less than $2 a day. The rebuilding efforts have been slow, and major streets in the capital city of Port-au-Prince are still covered in debris. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who heads a reconstruction commission, has faced criticism for the lack of tangible results. The anniversary of the earthquake promises little in the way of celebration, with many people expressing disappointment in the lack of progress. The article also mentions the reopening of Port-au-Prince's restored Iron Market as part of the commemoration events. The market, a cultural and architectural landmark, was badly damaged in the earthquake and has been restored with funding from Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel. However, for many Haitians living in crowded camps, such projects hold little interest. The country has also faced other challenges, including a cholera epidemic and a controversial presidential election. The article ends by mentioning the nostalgia some Haitians have for the rule of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, who continued the rule of his father Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier. Despite the ongoing experiment with democracy in Haiti, some people believe that things were better under the Duvalier regime. Overall, the article highlights the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti and the challenges the country continues to face in its recovery from the earthquake.
Claim: Quake amputees embody resilience in broken Haiti.
The claim veracity: true

### Response:

The story is factually accurate and is based on first-hand reporting. The story is well-written and well-organized, and it is clear and engaging. The story does a good job of capturing the spirit of the amputee soccer players and their resilience in the face of adversity. The story could have been improved by including more information about the rebuilding efforts in Haiti and the challenges the country continues to face. The story could also have included more information about the history of Haiti and the Duvalier regime.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The U.S. State Department has issued an updated travel advisory for U.S. travelers, urging them to ""exercise increased caution"" due to reports of a probable Ebola-related death in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. However, Tanzania denies these reports and claims that no cases of Ebola have been confirmed. The government is facing mounting pressure to provide clarification on the situation. The foreign affairs ministry has not yet commented on the U.S. advisory. Authorities in east and central Africa have been on high alert for possible spillovers of Ebola from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where an outbreak has already claimed over 2,100 lives. Tanzania shares a border with the DRC, separated by a lake. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently criticized Tanzania for refusing to provide details of suspected Ebola cases, which goes against international health regulations. The WHO expressed concern over the lack of transparency but stated that it has no evidence of Ebola presence in Tanzania. The organization ruled out punitive action and reiterated its advice against travel or trade restrictions. In response to Tanzania's lack of transparency, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traveled to Tanzania at the direction of U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar. Azar had previously criticized Tanzania for not sharing information. Tanzania summoned the WHO's local representative over their assertion of suspected Ebola cases in the country. The government had previously investigated two cases of unknown illnesses, but they tested negative for Ebola. The situation in Tanzania highlights the importance of transparency in combating the deadly and fast-spreading hemorrhagic fever. With the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the neighboring DRC, authorities are on high alert and urging countries to share information to prevent the spread of the disease.
Claim: U.S. travel warning adds to pressure on Tanzania over suspected Ebola cases.

The study, led by Dr. Aaron Devor, a sociologist and chair in transgender studies at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, is funded by a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The study aims to explore the experiences of transgender and non-binary people in sport, including how they are treated by coaches, officials, teammates, and spectators. The study is part of a larger research project that includes an online survey and interviews with transgender and non-binary people who have participated in sport.

Regarding high school graduates, the article states that Texas ranked last in percentage of high school graduates in 2009, with 79.9% of Texans having graduated from high school.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an alert regarding the over-prescription and misuse of the cough medicine Tussionex Pennkinetic Extended-Release Suspension, manufactured by UCB. The FDA has received reports of doctors over-prescribing the medicine and individuals taking it more frequently than recommended, as well as giving it to children under the age of 6, despite it not being approved for that age group. Tussionex contains hydrocodone, a narcotic pain reliever, and excessive consumption can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Since its approval in 1987, there have been reports of health problems and deaths among children and adults who took Tussionex. Five deaths have been reported among children under 6 who took the medicine. UCB has proposed a stronger warning for the medicine following these reports. The FDA is urging doctors and patients to follow prescribing instructions and use a medical syringe or other device designed to measure liquid medications, as household spoons vary in size and should not be used. UCB, based in Belgium, will update the Tussionex label to address these concerns. The FDA's alert aligns with UCB's efforts to ensure proper use of the product. The company had already taken steps to clarify the label in 2007. UCB does not plan to withdraw the product as the FDA alert only addresses improper use. In 2007, Tussionex sales in the U.S. totaled 114 million euros ($176 million).

91,91,27876,The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.,"The article confirms the claim that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. Giant hogweed is an invasive herb in the carrot family that was originally brought to North America from Asia. It has become established in various regions of the United States, including New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northwest. The plant grows along streams and rivers, as well as in fields, forests, yards, and roadsides. It can reach a height of 14 feet or more, with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width. The sap of the giant hogweed contains toxic chemicals called furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis. This condition leads to reddening of the skin, followed by severe blistering and burns. The injuries can last for several months, and even after they have healed, the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. If the sap enters the eyes, it can cause temporary or even permanent blindness. If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, it is recommended to take the following steps: if a reaction occurs, applying topical steroids early on may lessen the severity of the reaction and provide relief. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so it is advised to apply sunblock and keep the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible. The article also mentions that giant hogweed is not the only dangerous plant one might encounter. Other plants that can cause harm include oleander, a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways, and sago palm, a decorative shrub found in gardens and homes. In conclusion, the article confirms that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Some people believe that these trails are actually chemicals being sprayed into the air by the government, but there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. The article explains that the trails are caused by the exhaust of the aircraft, which contains water vapor and other gases. The water vapor condenses into ice crystals, which form the trails. The article also mentions that some people believe that the government is using chemtrails to control the weather, but this is also not supported by scientific evidence.

92,92,8845,Repeat blood clots more common with stents: study.,"A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot. This risk is particularly high for patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago. Stents are wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the coronary arteries to keep them from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. However, clots can form inside the stent, known as stent thrombosis, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack or death. The researchers found that the use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis. Patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment were 4.2 times more likely to experience another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who had previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times more likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times more likely to suffer a repeat episode. The study analyzed 437 patients with various types of stents who had experienced stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. Of these patients, 16.9 percent had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis, with 61 patients experiencing two episodes, 12 patients experiencing three episodes, and one patient experiencing four episodes. In conclusion, the study highlights the increased risk of repeat blood clots in patients who have had a coronary stent. The use of an additional stent during emergency treatment, a history of heart attack, and late stent thrombosis were identified as factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing another episode of stent thrombosis. These findings emphasize the importance of closely monitoring patients with stents to prevent further complications.",true,"Treating a stent-related blood clot with an additional stent in an emergency procedure sharply raises the risk that a patient will get a second clot and should be avoided, Dutch researchers said on Saturday.","A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot.

In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot. This risk is particularly high for patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago. Stents are wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the coronary arteries to keep them from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. However, clots can form inside the stent, known as stent thrombosis, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack or death. The researchers found that the use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis. Patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment were 4.2 times more likely to experience another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who had previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times more likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times more likely to suffer a repeat episode. The study analyzed 437 patients with various types of stents who had experienced stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. Of these patients, 16.9 percent had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis, with 61 patients experiencing two episodes, 12 patients experiencing three episodes, and one patient experiencing four episodes. In conclusion, the study highlights the increased risk of repeat blood clots in patients who have had a coronary stent. The use of an additional stent during emergency treatment, a history of heart attack, and late stent thrombosis were identified as factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing another episode of stent thrombosis. These findings emphasize the importance of closely monitoring patients with stents to prevent further complications.
Claim: Repeat blood clots more common with stents: study.

What's true: A study found that 1 in 6 patients who suffered a clot inside a coronary stent were at risk of developing another clot. What's false: The article does not mention any false claims.

93,93,1688,Amazonian tribe study shows how human bodily bacteria is changing.,"A study published in the journal Science Advances has found that the gut, mouth, and skin microbes of the Yanomami villagers, an isolated tribe in southern Venezuela's Amazonian jungles, possess the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in humans. The Yanomami villagers, who were secluded from the outside world until 2009, have bacteria that include some never before detected in humans. Surprisingly, the researchers also found antibiotic-resistant genes in the Yanomami's microbes, even though they have never been exposed to commercial antibiotics. The human body hosts trillions of microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, which are essential for human health. However, modern practices such as processed foods and antibiotics have led to a decline in microbiota diversity. This decline may be linked to the increase in immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes, and obesity. The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 Yanomami villagers and compared them to a group from the United States, another indigenous group from the Venezuelan Amazonian region called the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. The Yanomami villagers were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties compared to the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the other groups offer beneficial effects, such as protecting against kidney stones. The Yanomami villagers are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in a remote mountainous region. The researchers believe that studying their microbiota provides a unique opportunity to understand the impact of modern practices on human bodily bacteria. The findings of this study suggest that the pre-modern human microbiota had a greater diversity of bacteria and bacterial functions compared to populations affected by modern practices. Overall, this study highlights how modern life may be altering humankind's bodily bacteria and the potential consequences of a decline in microbiota diversity.",true,"Everyone’s body is brimming with bacteria, and these microbes do plenty of good things like building the immune system and helping digestion.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.
Claim: Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient.
The claim veracity: mixture

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.
Claim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property. What's false: Nygard was not thrown in jail for simply erecting a windmill; Nygard did not spend six months in jail.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine criticized a research study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University that uses young pigs to study the effects of alcohol consumption on the heart. The committee argued that the money spent on such research could be better used elsewhere in Rhode Island. They claimed that Rhode Island's teen binge drinking rate is double the national average and that the researchers are wasting federal funds on experiments giving alcohol to piglets. However, the claim made by the committee is incorrect. The most recent report that includes both national and state-by-state figures shows that Rhode Island's teen binge drinking rate is actually less than the national average. The committee acknowledged that they should have been more careful in their comparison and that they would have worded it differently if given the chance.

The study does not aim to get African men to like girls, as claimed in the article. The article also makes a number of other claims that are not supported by evidence. For example, it claims that the study is part of a larger effort by the Obama administration to promote gay marriage, but there is no evidence to support this claim.

Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction. The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals. The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings. The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased. The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question. Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people
The claim veracity: true

### Response:
This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine. The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days. The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability. In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article discusses the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports in New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. These guidelines require anyone passing through the airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they are not showing symptoms, to be quarantined. The article mentions that these guidelines have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, who argue that they are unnecessary. The article also mentions that JFK, Newark, and O'Hare airports already have screening processes in place, along with three other American airports. Experts say that people who are not showing symptoms of Ebola are not contagious. The article then discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It states that Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia, Liberia, where he had been screened for Ebola. However, he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving in the United States. The article notes that it is unclear whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States, as American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola at that time. The article also mentions that airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been taking place since at least August. These screenings involve taking travelers' temperatures, answering health questionnaires, and visually assessing them for signs of illness. The article states that screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada, and now the United States. The article concludes by stating that the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines in early October for travelers from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports. These guidelines require travelers to go through an Ebola screening process, including temperature checks and questions about possible exposure. The article notes that even with these screening measures in place, it is possible that Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms. Overall, the article provides information about the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports and discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, who was the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States and mentions the existing airport screenings in West Africa and other countries.

Context: The article discusses the use of a new technology, called CRISPR, which can edit the genome of any living organism. The technology has been used to edit the genome of human embryos in China, and a team of scientists in the US has now used it to edit the genome of pig embryos. The aim of the research is to produce pigs that can be used as organ donors for humans, as there is a shortage of human organs available for transplant. The researchers used CRISPR to edit the genome of pig embryos to remove a gene that causes the pig organs to be rejected by the human immune system. The edited embryos were then implanted into sows, and the resulting piglets were born healthy and free of the gene. The researchers are now working to create a herd of pigs with the edited genome, which could be used as organ donors for humans. The article also mentions that the use of CRISPR to edit the genome of human embryos has raised ethical concerns, and that the researchers in the US have not yet used the technology to edit the genome of human",Issa’s claim that Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States is contradicted by available evidence.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Response:
What's true: In 2014, some Scandinavian state agencies recalled Fireball whisky until they could determine if it met local regulations regarding propylene glycol content. What's false: Fireball whisky has been broadly recalled from all markets because it contains antifreeze.
