0,295,WHO recommends one-hour maximum screen time per day for under-5s.,"The United Nations agency, issuing its first such guidelines, said under-fives should also be physically active and get adequate sleep to help develop good lifelong habits and prevent obesity and other diseases in later life. “What we are cautioning on is over-use of those electronic screen times with young children,” WHO expert Dr. Fiona Bull told a news briefing. In its guidelines to member states, the WHO said children between one and four years old should spend at least three hours in a variety of physical activities spread throughout the day. Infants under one should interact in floor-based play and avoid all screens, it said. Being inactive is fueling a rise in the numbers of obese or overweight people worldwide, the WHO said. Excessive weight can lead to premature death from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and some forms of cancer. “Preventing these deaths needs to start in very early life,” Bull said. One in three adults today are overweight or obese, and one in four adults does not do enough physical activity, she said. “In this age group of under 5s, it is currently 40 million children around the world (who) are overweight. Of that (figure) 50 percent are in Africa and the southeast Asia region,” Bull said. That translates into 5.9 percent of children globally. Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development during which habits are formed and family lifestyle routines are adaptable, said the WHO guidelines, drawn from evidence in hundreds of studies, many from Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States. “Sedentary behaviors, whether riding motorized transport rather than walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, watching TV or playing inactive screen-based games are increasingly prevalent and associated with poor health outcomes,” the WHO said. Chronic insufficient sleep in children has been associated with increased excessive fat accumulation as measured by body mass index (BMI), it said. Shorter sleep duration has been associated with more TV viewing and time spent playing computer games, it added.",true,"Young children should not spend more than an hour a day watching television and videos or playing computer games and infants less than one year old should not be exposed to electronic screens at all, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life.

Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice.

The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink.

1,11286,Stem cell experiment lets diabetics forgo insulin,"There was no discussion of the cost of this experimental procedure, and although it is an experimental procedure, some attempt could have been made to project costs. The broadcast states that 14 of 15 patients “seem to be cured because they have not needed insulin shots for as long as three years.” This is the main finding of the research and a reasonable summary of the therapy’s benefit. The broadcast outlines the harms that this “potentially very dangerous procedure” might cause (e.g. infection) as a result of knocking out a patient’s immune system. The broadcast explains that 14 of the 15 patients who received the experimental treatment no longer need injections of insulin to control their diabetes. Though the broadcast cites experts urging caution about the safety of the new therapy, no one points out that even if the procedure were safe, the remarkable findings could be the result of chance or bias. As the researchers point out in their published manuscript, these findings will need to be validated in studies that randomly assign patients to both the new treatment and a comparison therapy (such as standard care or a sham), assess their health using clinicians who do not know which treatment each patient received, and conduct tests to explain how exactly the new treatment seems to work. Because there is often a period of remission after the onset of Type I diabetes in which patients appear to improve without extraordinary measures, doctors will also have to follow both groups of patients for a longer period of time. The broadcast, though cautious (and limited by TV’s self-imposed time constraints), does not explain this. There is no evidence of disease-mongering. The broadcast balances statements from a cautious but hopeful coauthor of the new research with those of both a concerned academic ethicist and the mother of a young girl who has Type I diabetes. The broadcast transcript mentions insulin injections, the standard of care for Type I diabetes. In addition, the video shows a seven-year-old girl managing her disease through a daily routine of glucose monitoring and insulin shots–an effective way to illustrate the discipline and hardships the current standard therapy imposes on children with the disease, as well as why new approaches would be so welcome. The story makes it clear that this is an experimental treatment and not widely available. The broadcast suggests that this form of stem cell therapy is new. This is true, though experimentation with similar treatments for Type I diabetes go back to the 1990s. No obvious use of text from the press release.",true,"The NBC broadcast nicely contrasts the demands that glucose monitoring and insulin shots impose on Type I diabetes patients with the tremendous uncertainty associated with experimental stem cell treatments that might free patients from these daily routines. It summarizes the treatment’s apparent benefits and potential harms, as well as ethical concerns about exporting research on dangerous treatments to countries such as Brazil where patients may not fully understand the risks. If the broadcast has a weakness, it is that it fails to mention the limitations inherent in any small, nonrandomized, nonblinded study with short follow-up that investigates a new treatment in patients with a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. (See “Evidence” above.) Even if the treatments were relatively safe and conducted in the U.S., viewers should understand that such studies are awash in potential biases and should always be approached with caution.","A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years.

2,28668,Chinese people are selling each other bags of fresh air because of air pollution.,"It may have started as a joke in the Mel Brooks satire “Spaceballs,” but in February 2016 various publications began reporting that bottles of fresh air were being sold to Chinese customers seeking relief from persistent air pollution in major cities such as Beijing. As countries such as China and India have developed industrially, they have also developed major smog problems. In December 2016, the New York Times reported that Beijing officials sparked controversy when they listed smog as a natural disaster: Beijing is still reeling from a grimy November, and public anger over smog is running high. Some are concerned that classifying the murky air as a natural disaster will reduce pressure on officials to fix the problem, The Beijing News said. Levels of fine particulate air pollution, known as PM2.5, soared to a monthly average of 100 micrograms per cubic meter in November, according to Luo Yi, head of the Ministry of Environmental Protection’s environmental monitoring bureau, a ministry statement said. PM2.5 particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, and they can enter deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream. Across the so-called Jingjinji region — which is home to 130 million people and includes Beijing, the surrounding province of Hebei and the port city of Tianjin — the average PM2.5 level in November was 102 micrograms per cubic meter, Mr. Luo said. According to the World Health Organization, which has stricter guidelines than most countries, yearly averages of PM2.5 levels should not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Moses Lam, a Canadian entrepreneur, saw an unlikely product opportunity in this phenomenon: pristine Canadian Rockies air. Lam said his canned air business is booming: We’re selling fresh air in China, but we sell in a can, not in a bag. We started our company first selling two Ziploc bags full of air. After we sold them on eBay, we figured there might be a bit of a market there, and we wanted to improve our product. So we started compressing air in cans. Now Lam’s company, Vitality Air, sells thousands of cans of fresh air collected from Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. He has customers in China, India and South Korea, with a developing market in Vietnam. On 3 January 2017, the Chinese government announced that 24 cities were on “red alert” for smog, with “red” being the most serious level for alerts in China’s four-tiered public warning system. Lam said that during the winter months, pollution gets worse because Chinese citizens are heating their homes and burning coal, which adds to pollution produced by coal-burning factories: The pollution and our sales for product goes hand in hand for sure. We see a spike in sales, we also see a spike in people asking for distributorship of our products. Every time this year we move thousands and thousands of bottles. Lam said he’s seen photographs of Chinese people selling each other inflated bags of air, but that’s not where he got the idea. Vitality, which incorporated in 2015, has a 24-foot trailer and 14,000 pounds of equipment (including a giant vacuum device) which Lam uses when he drives from Edmonton to Banff and collects 200,000 liters of air over about a 40-hour period. The air is compressed into containers that double as face masks, allowing customers to experience the smell and quality of Rocky Mountain air for about 160 breaths: Lovin’ that Rocky Mtn air! Puffing away all morning. On a natural high. @vitalityair payingforair pic.twitter.com/5cIQdx1YaZ — Dave Mitchell (@mitchee69) June 10, 2016 Lam’s idea has caught on. Leo De Watts and his company, AethAer, sell empty-looking jars for £80 (nearly $100 U.S.) … but the emptiness is in the eye of the beholder. According to the company’s web site, the jars contain air from pristine parts of Great Britain, including Dorset, Yorkshire and Somerset: A businessman is raking in thousands of pounds selling jars of ‘fresh air’ to people in China for £80 each. Leo De Watts, 27, sells air collected in the British countryside and ships it over to polluted cities Shanghai and Beijing, where the wealthy elite pay a hefty sum for a few seconds of inhalation. A video shows De Watts standing in a gusty English meadow with a woman appearing to “catch” air in a large bag behind him: The British newspaper The Independent notes that such products may be bought by consumers more as novelty or collector’s items than as practical sources of clean air: As well as those buying the product to inhale, it is reportedly also being purchased by people who will never open it, but instead keep the jar for its novelty value. The air is collected using jars held in makeshift nets, which are held into the air and walked around in areas far removed from anywhere polluted — a process Watts describes as ‘air farming’. Reuters reported that a millionaire Chinese philanthropist handed out cans of fresh air as a stunt to make a political point abut the environment: Chen Guangbiao, who made his fortune in the recycling business and is a high-profile philanthropist, on Wednesday handed out soda pop-sized cans of air, purportedly from far-flung, pristine regions of China such as Xinjiang in the northwest to Taiwan, the southeast coast. “I want to tell mayors, county chiefs and heads of big companies: don’t just chase GDP growth, don’t chase the biggest profits at the expense of our children and grandchildren and at the cost of sacrificing our ecological environment”, Chen said. Vitality Air’s head said the pollution problem in China is so pervasive he doesn’t believe will be corrected any time soon, and he acknowledged how serious it is — after a trip to China, he reported, he coughed for three weeks upon returning home to Edmonton.",mixture,"What's true: Some customers in China are buying bottles and cans of fresh air. What's false: The companies selling the air are not Chinese firms, the air is sold in compressed form in cans or in bottles (not in plastic bags), and the product is not necessarily being bought as a practical source of clean air.","The article discusses the issue of air pollution in China and how it has led to the sale of fresh air in various forms. It mentions that in February 2016, bottles of fresh air were being sold to Chinese customers as a relief from air pollution. The New York Times reported that Beijing officials listed smog as a natural disaster, causing controversy and concerns that it would reduce pressure on officials to fix the problem. The article also highlights the high levels of fine particulate air pollution, known as PM2.5, in Beijing and the surrounding region, which far exceed the World Health Organization's guidelines. 

The article then focuses on two entrepreneurs who have capitalized on the demand for fresh air.

3,10054,Study Suggests Special MRI Might Help Diagnose Autism,"The story deserves high marks for noting the high costs of an MRI. “This test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.” The story starts off with a very vague description of the study’s findings, saying, “The researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch’s group noted.” What would be considered significant when comparing one group of 12 to another group of 15? The story does provide a bit more specific information later saying, “To further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.” We felt this was inadequate and also misleading. As the story goes on to point out, the brain differences that were found may not be exclusive to autism. There’s a chance, in fact, that were the study group much larger that there would have been many other subjects who had the same brain activity but were not otherwise diagnosed as autistic. There are no harms quantified or even mentioned, which is disappointing. The harms from an inaccurate diagnosis of autism or any other disorder can be real and devastating. The story notes the limitations of the study several times and in several ways. For example, it says, “For one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.” We would have liked more details about the correlation between clinical symptoms and the fMRI findings. The story avoids disease-mongering and takes care to acknowledge that there are different shades of autism along a spectrum. “For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.” HealthDay continues its laudable tradition of listing the story’s sources at the end of the piece.. We thought the quotes from independent experts were great and provided some strong context. The story does not go into much detail about the alternatives to MRI screening, but it does say that most chlidren are diagnosed by a clinician, not through any biological screening or brain scan. The story makes it clear that using MRIs to diagnose autism is an uNPRoven approach. The author of the study says, “This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,” she said. The story could have pointed out that the validity of the testing would be dependent on the expertise of the radiologist, as reading functinal MRI is different from traditional MRI. The story shows that there is still a lot of work to be done before MRIs could be used as a novel screening device for autism. The story does not rely on a news release.",true,"If it had spent a little more time quantifying the potential benefits of this screening, and if it had discussed any of the potential harms, it would have earned a higher rating. MRIs are being touted as a breakthrough screening for a range of conditions, with promises that “early intervention” will save lives and eliminate suffering. For this to be true, studies have to be properly designed and have to target the right population of patients. The study in question here does neither well, and the story does a decent job capturing the uncertainty around the study’s findings.","A recent study suggests that a special type of MRI could potentially be used to diagnose autism. The study found that there were differences in brain activity between typical children and children with autism in the language comprehension area. However, the article notes that these differences may not be exclusive to autism and that a larger study group may have included subjects with similar brain activity who were not diagnosed as autistic. The article also mentions that there are no quantified or mentioned harms associated with an inaccurate diagnosis of autism. The limitations of the study are acknowledged, such as the fact that it was conducted on school-aged children and that it is unknown if the same differences in neuroimaging would be found in younger patients. The article emphasizes that the technique of using MRIs to diagnose autism is unproven and not widely applicable. The expertise of the radiologist is also mentioned as a factor in the validity of the testing. The article concludes that there is still much work to be done before MRIs can be used as a screening device for autism.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

4,30152,A video shows the aftermath of a school prank in which a student spiked lemonade with laxatives.,"A video purportedly showing the aftermath of a school prank in which a student spiked a batch of lemonade with laxatives was uploaded to the web site LiveLeak in mid-September 2018. This footage racked up millions of views when it was shared on Facebook along with the caption: “So Wrong: A student puts laxative in the school’s lemonade”: This video does not capture real students at a high school suffering bouts of diarrhea after a student spiked their lemonade with laxatives. This footage was taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal and depicts a staged incident involving a group of actors. American Vandal plays like a true crime documentary, but instead of focusing on villainous acts such as murder, the mockumentary takes place in a high school and features juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism. The second season of the show, which made its debut just a few days before this video went viral, opened with an episode entitled “Brown Out.” The New Yorker described the opening sequence of that episode thusly: I got a queasy feeling watching the opening sequence of the new season of “American Vandal,” and not only because it showed a lunchroom full of teenagers soiling themselves. The scene is certainly disgusting: in an event known afterward as “the Brownout,” students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in tony Bellevue, Washington, having been poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade, suffer together in a grisly act of mass defecation, all of it memorialized in real time and shared on social media. Some of the footage from this viral hoax video can also be glimpsed in a trailer for the second season of the show:",false,A video appears to capture the disturbing and messy aftermath of a school prank.,"The video in question, which shows the aftermath of a school prank involving spiked lemonade, is not real. It was uploaded to the website LiveLeak in mid-September 2018 and gained millions of views on Facebook. However, the footage is actually taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal. The show is a satirical take on true crime documentaries and focuses on juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism in a high school setting.

The second season of American Vandal, which premiered shortly before the viral video, features an episode called ""Brown Out."" In this episode, students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in Bellevue, Washington, are poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade and suffer from mass defecation. The opening sequence of this episode, which shows the students soiling themselves, was described as disgusting by The New Yorker.

Some of the footage from the viral hoax video can also be seen in a trailer for the second season of American Vandal. This confirms that the video is not a real incident but a staged scene from the show.

In summary, the claim that the video captures real students suffering from diarrhea after a prank involving spiked lemonade is false. The video is actually a scene from the Netflix mockumentary series American Vandal, which depicts fictional events in a high school setting.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

5,10447,"Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds","No price tags. A New York Times article from 2005 discussed the expense of drugs like Tarceva. According to drugstore.com, the regimen used in the study costs $4700 a month. Iloprost isn’t cheap, either. No data are presented for the iloprost study. As this was the lead item in the article, we have to give an Unsatisfactory rating. Even though preliminary data from a conference presentation has to be taken with a skeptical eyebrow, the public learns even less from a vague, flat, non-quantified summary of the benefits. Some data are presented for the erlotinib study. No harms of iloprost or erlotinib are mentioned. In the iloprost study, 11% of subjects receiving the drug reported serious adverse events. That’s a pretty big omission. Both halves of the story were good to point out the number of subjects and placebo control groups in each study. The venues for presentation and trial phases are critical pieces of information, but terms like Phase II aren’t meaningful to most people. They should have been explained. Regarding the iloprost study, the marquee topic, the story fails to point out that Phase II data reported at conferences are preliminary. Although the article acknowledges that further study is needed, it simply quotes the abstract and provides no context. It should’ve been clearer that conference abstracts haven’t gone through full peer review process. It also doesn’t explain, related to the key finding, what it means to have significant improvement in ""endobronchial dysplasia."" The study looked at changes in lung tissue. From the abstract, it doesn’t seem that study made any clinical assessments or diagnoses. In other words, the study didn’t tell us which subjects did and did not ultimately develop lung cancer. While the drug may prove effective towards that end, this study doesn’t tell us. Also missing from the details on the iloprost study was the fact that the study didn’t enroll just smokers and ex-smokers: it enrolled those at increased risk of lung cancer because they had abnormal cells in their sputum. According to one study, most but not all smokers have this risk factor. The second half of the story begins by citing vague, unnamed research about myo-inositol in the prevention of lung cancer. No evaluation of the quality of this evidence was provided, nor was there a way for readers to find out more. Then we move to a published study of erlotinib maintenance therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We’re unsure how it’s connected to the previous half of the article, as the heading is simply ""Italian research."" The reporting of this study is slightly better than the iloprost coverage, including some actual data. But without caveats for the studies discussed previously, we’re led to think the three studies are of equal high quality. Most readers will not be able to decode terms like ""Phase 2,"" ""Phase 3,"" ""presented to a meeting,"" and ""reported in Lancet Oncology."" If the author had decided to cover a smorgasborg of disparate lung cancer news, which there’s nothing wrong with, it should not have implied that the first study was on equal footing to the second. It would have also been good to note whether the ""little"" differences in the erlotinib study were statistically significant. (They were.) An independent source could’ve spoken to the clinical significance of these results. (For example, the accompanying Lancet Oncology editorial suggests that they were only compelling enough to change therapy for the subgroup who had EGFR mutations.) The article doesn’t engage in disease-mongering. Independent sources were entirely absent. An independent voice might have added the missing caveats to the preliminary nature of the iloprost data, the fact that the results had already been presented last year, etc. For the coverage of the erlotinib study, independent appraisal might have added some objective context beyond taking the investigators’ claim that their study shows that more clinicians should follow their strategy. The independent source could have been the Lancet Oncology editorial that accompanied the erlotinib study, which discussed some potential limitations in this approach in clinical practice, e.g., regarding EGFR mutations and a history of chemotherapy treatment. Finally, an unaffiliated voice may have pointed out the history and context: in April, the FDA used the results of the erlotinib study to approve Tarceva for the use in maintenance therapy, and not without some controversy. It was against the recommendation of the FDA’s advisory panel, who voted 12-1 vote against approval. (See this article for more details.) The story makes the publication of this study in the journal sound like a bombshell in a vacuum. No conflicts of interest were identified. The erlotinib study was funded by a drug company. As the first study did not show that the drug can prevent cancer, no alternative needs to be mentioned. The story did mention a natural supplement that was recently studied for prevention; we think this nod was so fast and vague, it was more confusing than helpful. It almost felt like a non sequitur. The story mentions that less than half of patients with successfully treated lung cancer currently receive maintenance therapy thereafter. Besides no treatment, none of the alternatives are mentioned. The story gets a marginal satisfactory. In the first half, we’re told of inhaled iloprost’s availability for certain indications, which don’t include the prevention of lung cancer. It could have been a lot clearer that the oral formulation is not currently available to patients; right now, we can only tell that by inference given the indications and brands mentioned for inhaled and IV formulations are mentioned. In the second half, we’re told that erlotinib is currently sold as Tarceva. It would have been good to note its indications, which were expanded in April to cover the approach used in this study because of the results of the study. A mixed bag here. The story establishes that iloprost is currently not approved for the prevention of lung cancer. It’s unclear about the novelty of the oral formulation in any indication. Also, it seems that the study was already reported at a different conference in August 2009, which had some press coverage. There may have been further analysis, but the conclusion seems to have been the same. It speaks to newsworthiness of the 2010 presentation. Regarding erlotinib, the story tells us that less than half of patients with successfully treated lung cancer currently receive maintenance therapy thereafter. What’s missing is that Tarcvea is already approved for this use, due to earlier access to the results of the Italian study. It’s a pretty important piece of information, and it would’ve put the news in much more context. We can’t be sure of the extent to which the story may have relied on a news release. We do know that it didn’t quote any independent sources.",false,"Does the pressure to meet a certain volume or quota of stories force some news organizations to feel they must report on abstracts and news briefings from medical/scientific meetings? If so, we suggest that a paradigm shift is in order. Read the full review to see why. Coverage of conference presentations needs caveats about the preliminary nature of the evidence. The story had barely any data, not a word from an independent source, and left out potential harms and costs.","The article discusses a study on the drug iloprost and its potential to prevent lung cancer. The study found that iloprost showed significant improvement in ""endobronchial dysplasia,"" which is a change in lung tissue. However, the study did not assess whether the subjects ultimately developed lung cancer or not. The article also mentions that the study enrolled individuals at increased risk of lung cancer due to abnormal cells in their sputum, not just smokers and ex-smokers.

The article then moves on to discuss a study on the drug erlotinib, which is sold as Tarceva. The study found that erlotinib maintenance therapy showed promising results for patients with advanced lung cancer. However, the article does not provide any caveats or context for the studies discussed, leading readers to believe that all three studies mentioned are of equal high quality.

The article also fails to mention that the erlotinib study was funded by a drug company and that the FDA approved Tarceva for maintenance therapy based on the results of the study, despite controversy and a negative recommendation from the FDA's advisory panel.

The article does not provide any independent sources or voices to add context or evaluate the studies. It also does not mention any conflicts of interest. The story gets a marginal satisfactory rating as it does mention that iloprost is not currently approved for the prevention of lung cancer and that erlotinib is sold as Tarceva.

Overall, the article lacks important information and context, and does not provide a comprehensive and unbiased view of the studies discussed.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

6,8780,New antibody drug helps cells kill blood cancer.,"All seven patients with previously incurable non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) who were given the highest dose of Micromet Inc’s experimental drug blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The results, which were published in the journal Science, are a boost for the concept of harnessing the power of the body’s cytotoxic, or cell-destroying, T-cells against tumors. Until now, scientists have struggled to find a way of triggering a T-cell attack. But blinatumomab works by binding them to cancer cells, allowing the T-cells to more effectively kill the tumor. Importantly, it does so without setting off uncontrolled T-cell activity. Two years ago six men were left seriously ill when a clinical trial of another experimental drug made by TeGenero went badly wrong. “It’s a very different kind of response,” Patrick Baeuerle, Micromet’s chief scientific officer, told Reuters. “It does activate the T-cells but it only activates those in contact with a tumor cell, so it is very conditional.” If all goes well, German-U.S. firm Micromet hopes next year to conduct a pivotal clinical trial necessary to win regulatory approval. The drug, for which AstraZeneca has marketing rights in North America, is also in mid-stage Phase II clinical tests against acute lymphocytic leukemia. In the Phase I trial reported for NHL, 38 patients were given varying doses of the drug, with 11 of those receiving higher dosages showing major responses and tumor regression, despite being given no other supporting chemotherapy. There were a number of side effects with the product, which targets a protein called CD19, but most occurred in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. Significantly, the amount of drug needed was much lower than for existing antibody treatments such as Roche and Genentech’s Rituxan/MabThera. “With these low doses, cost of goods should not be much of an issue,” said Baeuerle.",true,"A new kind of antibody drug that makes the body’s own “killer” cells fight tumors has produced promising early-stage results in patients with a deadly form of blood cancer, researchers said on Thursday.","A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer.

The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL.

Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue.

Overall, the results of the Phase I trial for blinatumomab in NHL are promising and provide hope for patients with previously incurable blood cancer. The drug's ability to activate T-cells in a controlled manner without causing excessive T-cell activity is a significant advancement in cancer treatment.

In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries.

7,34669,A teenaged girl was drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working on behalf of sex traffickers.,"On 20 June 2015, a Facebook user published a screenshot of the text message transcribed below, which described a harrowing near miss abduction effort that supposedly occurred in the bathroom of a Dillard’s department store in Denton, Texas: Example: [Collected via e-mail, June 2015] So.. A friend of mine knows a mom and a daughter that was shopping at Dillard’s in DENTON… In the mall. The girl is close to my age. She told her mom she had to go to the bathroom so her mom said awesome, you go to the bathroom, I’ll go checkout and then we can meet at the car. So they did.. The mom was waiting in the car for awhile and she thought man, it’s been awhile so she walked back into Dillard’s and crossed paths with 2 girls CARRYING her daughter out of Dillard’s. The mom asked the girls what they were doing and they said “oh.. Haha this is our friend.. She’s drunk, she passed out in the bathroom, we’re just taking her home” … The mom said “THATS MY DAUGHTER! !” .. Come to find out these two girls were hiding in the bathroom, when the daughter walked in, one pinned her down and the the other shot her up with black laced heroine. It basically paralyzed her. Come to find out, these 2 girls worked for sex trafficking that’s going on IN Denton. The post’s claim of kidnappers working on behalf of sex traffickers echoed a rash of similar messages recently spread by social media users: In late May 2015, a Facebook user made a similar claim about a brush with abductors in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store; in early June, Twitter was carried away by warnings of human traffickers targeting college kids on summer break through job interviews; and late June saw yet another outbreak of the venerable theme park abduction urban legend. Like the breathless tales of sex trafficking tricks that immediately preceded it, the warning about the incident in a Denton Dillard’s bore elements of a classic urban legend: it happened to a friend of a friend, at an indeterminate time, and included no details tying the claim to verifiable documentation (such as a news article or police report). And as in the Hobby Lobby case, local police were quick to respond and report that social media users might have gotten a little overexcited about the claim: We have recently had many people asking us if a post going around on social media sites about an incident at a store in our local mall is true. Currently we cannot find a report on file to substantiate that claim and therefore we feel that there is no cause for alarm. We will continue to look into this to determine if it is true or just a rumor/hoax. Facebook users commenting upon the 20 June 2015 post by the City of Denton Police Department linked to an article about human trafficking raids in Denton. Police in turn pointed out that that news was nearly a year old: This was from July of 2014.",unproven,"Moreover, the referenced article linked described a police crackdown on a Denton County human trafficking operation that did not involve abductions of victims from department store restrooms, the use of heroin to drug unwitting teen shoppers, the intervention of a potential victim’s mother, the use of fellow teen girls as recruiting agents, or a situation that was halted before anyone was harmed. A separate article about the 2014 operation reported several arrests but made no mention of young girls being employed as operatives of a sex trafficking-related abduction ring.","The claim states that a teenage girl was drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working on behalf of sex traffickers. However, the article explains that this claim is likely a classic urban legend. 

The article mentions that on June 20, 2015, a Facebook user shared a screenshot of a text message describing a harrowing near miss abduction effort that supposedly occurred in the bathroom of a Dillard's department store in Denton, Texas. The text message claimed that two girls hid in the bathroom, pinned down the daughter, and injected her with black laced heroin, paralyzing her. The two girls then claimed that the daughter was their drunk friend and they were taking her home. The post also mentioned that these two girls worked for sex trafficking in Denton.

The article points out that this claim is similar to other messages spread on social media about kidnappers working on behalf of sex traffickers. These messages often lack verifiable documentation and rely on the ""friend of a friend"" narrative. The article mentions other instances of similar claims, such as a warning about abductors in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store and warnings about human traffickers targeting college kids through job interviews.

Local police quickly responded to the claim and stated that they could not find any report to substantiate it. They considered it a rumor or hoax and continued to investigate. Facebook users commenting on the post by the City of Denton Police Department linked to an article about human trafficking raids in Denton. However, the police clarified that the article was from July 2014, indicating that it was not related to the recent claim.

In summary, the claim of a teenage girl being drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working for sex traffickers is likely an urban legend. The lack of verifiable documentation and the similarity to other social media warnings about sex trafficking suggest that this claim is not true. Local police also stated that they could not find any evidence to support the claim.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The odds may not be in our favor, according to a recent Facebook post. ""Harvard scientists just predicted that it may take many months to find cure for coronavirus,"" the March 10 post says. ""According to them, virus is spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Spokespeople for Harvard University did not immediately reply to PolitiFact’s emails asking about the post. But news stories lend some credence to the Facebook post’s claims — and provide more information that the post fails to mention. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic that has infected nearly 120,000 people worldwide. More than 4,000 people have died and eight countries, including the United States, are currently each reporting more than 1,000 cases. Mark Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and an expert on viruses, told CBS News, among other news outlets, that 40% to 70% of the world’s adult population could be infected in the coming year. There are an estimated 7.6 billion people in the world, and an estimated 329 million in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Adults make up about three-quarters of the U.S. population. ""That is a projection,"" Lipsitch said during the March 2 interview, ""so we will find out if that’s accurate as things go on. It is the best estimate that I’ve been able to make based on a combination of the mathematical models that we use to track and predict epidemics."" Other estimates are similar. The Guardian reported on Feb. 11 that 60% of the global population could be infected if the virus is unchecked. On Feb. 13, Bloomberg reported that Ira Longini, an adviser to the World Health Organization, said two-thirds of the world’s population could catch COVID-19. But the publication also quoted David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, explaining that researchers need more data to get a better idea of how far the coronavirus could spread. ""The models will be refined as more information comes to light,"" he said. Our ruling The Facebook post says Harvard scientists say the coronavirus is ""spreading so fast that it will infect 70% of humanity this year.""

11,22336,David Prosser Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.,"The candidates in the acrimonious race for Wisconsin Supreme Court have spent a considerable amount of time focusing on their experience and qualifications for the job. Justice David Prosser’s experience is pretty simple to understand. He has served a dozen years on the court and was Outagamie County district attorney for a couple of years. A Republican, Prosser also served 16 years in the state Assembly, and was speaker. The JoAnne Kloppenburg file is more difficult to evaluate: 21 years as an attorney in the state Department of Justice. That leaves plenty of room for interpretation -- by the candidate and her opponent. That’s what happened in a March 21, 2011, debate at the Marquette University Law School. Prosser told the audience that Kloppenburg ""is incredibly envious"" of his record as a district attorney, and his time as a lawmaker and justice. He said he had prosecuted cases that involved violent crime. ""I’ve had victims of crime cry on my shoulder,"" Prosser said. He continued with this observation about Kloppenburg’s experience: ""She has a very different record as a prosecutor. It’s all the prosecution of DNR regulations of docks … the length of docks. The width of docks. Whether people can have docks. That’s a complete different kind of prosecution that I am familiar with or have been writing cases about as well for 12 and a half years."" That stopped us and undoubtedly many in the audience. More than two decades on cases hassling dock owners? Sounds like a lot of legal grunt work. It’s a claim that Prosser has made repeatedly on the campaign trail, and a theme that’s been picked up in ads from outside groups attacking Kloppenburg. We asked for backup. Prosser’s campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said in an email that state court records and other research tools showed 46 cases that involved Kloppenburg, 76 percent of which ""were for the DNR."" ""Of the 46, five were directly identifiable with piers,"" he said. Fair enough. For a decade, Kloppenburg led the Department of Justice’s environmental litigation team. Docks would be in her wheelhouse. Kloppenburg opponents have seized on her record as a environmental lawyer, painting her as an extremist. On March 29, talk show host Charlie Sykes said: ""If you are an environmental zealot, I do understand that JoAnne Kloppenburg is probably your candidate."" Sykes added: ""If you have a pier that’s a few feet too close … JoAnne Kloppenburg is your worst enemy."" But let’s circle back to the support Prosser’s campaign provided. Of the 46 cases cited, only five dealt with docks. What about the rest? The Kloppenburg campaign gave us a list of 17 published decisions of cases that she argued before the state Appeals Court. The cases involved water and air pollution permits, a landfill dispute and the state’s authority over navigable waterways. Two involved the civil rights of state prison inmates, one involved the treatment of a prisoner. No dock cases were included. The campaign noted that over the years, Kloppenburg has argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts around the state, and numerous cases before the state Supreme Court -- including one in which a decision was handed down March 23, two days after the debate at Marquette. In that case, Kloppenburg represented the state in a lawsuit involving a dispute over a hearing for a water discharge permit for a paper mill in Green Bay. Environmentalists wanted a public hearing about the permit; the DNR did not. Kloppenburg represented the DNR and won the case -- with Prosser voting with the majority. While environmentalists were unhappy with the decision, business groups -- some of which are paying for ads attacking Kloppenburg’s legal credentials -- were pleased. She said her campaign was able to identify citations of 206 court cases dating back to 1989, and said few, if any, involved docks or piers. Other cases she’s handled in her career included those involving complaints from prisoners, the state’s part of lawsuits against big tobacco companies, Indian treaty rights and gaming compacts, and medical malpractice caps. She has had numerous cases involving well-known state and local companies, including Patrick Cudahy, Enbridge, Georgia Pacific, and a sunken barge in the Menomonee River. Kloppenburg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board that her job was to enforce the state’s environmental laws. When we asked Prosser directly to explain his comment, he said he was well aware Kloppenburg handled a much broader variety of cases for the Justice Department than docks. Indeed, a number of them were argued before him on the Supreme Court. ""I’m certainly aware of the breadth of those cases,"" Prosser said, adding that his comments about docks were ""a little rhetorical flourish."" Prosser recalled a case about a July 2006 decision about a Green Lake subdivision that let homeowners have a fractional interest so they could have a boat slip on a nearby dock. The court ruled in favor of the DNR and forced the association to reduce the number of boat slips. Prosser also mentioned another case that was relayed to him in a private letter from a circuit court judge in northern Wisconsin. ""Those are the two I was most familiar with,"" Prosser said. He added this about his dock comment: ""I was really trying to inject a little bit of levity into this. I think the rhetorical flourish is easily justified in terms of these two cases."" But that flies in the face of the reality of the campaign. As we noted, the dock cases have emerged as a line of attack against Kloppenburg from several fronts. What’s more, those in the audience didn’t offer a lot of chuckles during that portion of the debate. Former Journal Sentinel reporter Alan Borsuk, who now works for the Marquette Law School, blogged this about the event: ""I’ve been at some testy and tense debates and joint appearances by candidates in various races, but this one was way up the list, if it wasn’t the champion on my personal list."" Borsuk noted the exchange about experience and said Prosser touted his record ""while slighting her record in environmental work with the attorney general’s office as involving ‘the length of (boat) docks.’"" Let’s bring this ship to shore. Justice Prosser told a debate audience that his opponent’s work as a prosecutor was very limited and said she only handled cases involving the size and length of docks. But the record shows a much broader range of cases handled by Kloppenburg in her time at the Department of Justice. Indeed, Prosser later said he was well aware of the ""breadth"" of those cases. What’s more, Prosser brushed the claim off as a ""rhetorical flourish"" and an attempt at ""levity."" That would be more believable if people treated it that way at the time and if it didn’t match up with one of the major lines of attack from Kloppenburg critics in the campaign. At PolitiFact, a statement is False if it is not accurate. It’s not accurate to say that Kloppenburg’s has only handled dock cases. That’s a ridiculous claim -- from a justice who has heard her argue a variety of cases before him on the state’s high court. False plus ridiculous equals .",false,Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser says challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record consists only of prosecuting cases regarding regulation of docks,"The article discusses a claim made by Justice David Prosser during a debate with his opponent, JoAnne Kloppenburg, for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Prosser stated that Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer in the state Department of Justice only involved the prosecution of cases regarding the regulation of docks. Prosser argued that his own experience as a district attorney and lawmaker made him more qualified for the position.

The article examines the validity of Prosser's claim by looking at the cases handled by Kloppenburg during her time at the Department of Justice. Prosser's campaign provided evidence of 46 cases involving Kloppenburg, with 76% of them related to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). However, only five of these cases dealt directly with docks. The Kloppenburg campaign provided a list of 17 published decisions of cases she argued before the state Appeals Court, none of which involved docks. They also mentioned that Kloppenburg had argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts and before the state Supreme Court, with few, if any, involving docks or piers.

Prosser later admitted that he was aware of the breadth of cases handled by Kloppenburg and that his comment about docks was a ""rhetorical flourish."" However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent Kloppenburg's record. Prosser's comment aligns with attacks from Kloppenburg's critics in the campaign, suggesting that it was not meant as a joke.

In conclusion, the article finds that Prosser's claim about Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer is false. Kloppenburg handled a much broader range of cases during her time at the Department of Justice, and Prosser's comment was not meant as a joke but as a line of attack against his opponent.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

13,33739,"Disney arranged to have himself frozen in cryonic chamber full of liquid nitrogen upon his death,","Walt Disney’s health had been deteriorating for many months before he finally agreed to enter St. Joseph hospital in California on 2 November 1966, for tests concerning the pain in his leg and neck. Doctors discovered a walnut-sized spot on the x-ray of his left lung and advised immediate surgery. Disney left the hospital to attend to studio business for a few days, then re-entered St. Joseph on Sunday, November 6, for surgery the next day. During Monday morning’s operation, doctors found his left lung to be cancerous and removed it. His oversized lymph nodes were an indication that Disney hadn’t much longer to live. After two weeks of post-operative care, Disney was released from the hospital. He crossed the street to his studios and spent another ten days tending to studio business and visiting relatives before he grew too weak and had to return to St. Joseph on November 30. His health started to fail even more rapidly than expected, and drugs and cobalt treatments sapped what little strength he had left. Walt Disney died two weeks later when his circulatory system collapsed on the morning of December 15, 1966. In the decades since Walt Disney’s death, the claim that he arranged for his body to be frozen has become ubiquitous. Nearly everyone familiar with the name ‘Walt Disney’ has heard the story that Disney’s corpse is stored in a deep-freeze chamber somewhere — directly under Disneyland’s “Pirates of the Caribbean” attraction is the most frequently mentioned site — awaiting the day when science could repair the damage to his body and bring ‘Uncle Walt’ back to life. Was Walt Disney aware of the possibilities of life extension through cryogenics? He certainly could have been aware of the progress being made in cryogenics research. Numerous articles and books on hypothermia and the preservation of animal tissue through freezing appeared in both the scientific/medical and general press in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. Anyone with an interest in the subject could easily have located this reading material, and even someone without a particular interest in the subject may have run across one or more articles on the topic in the general press. The subject of cryonics was further brought to the public’s attention with the publication in 1964 of Robert C.W. Ettinger’s book, The Prospect of Immortality. Ettinger’s book, drawing on much of the available literature about cryonics, covered the practical, legal, ethical, and moral impact of freezing and reviving human beings. Ettinger, while admitting that science had as yet no way of reviving frozen human beings, was unflaggingly optimistic that a viable means of reanimation would eventually be found, telling his readers: The fact: At very low temperatures it is possible, right now, to preserve dead people with essentially no deterioration, indefinitely. The assumption: If civilization endures, medical science should eventually be able to repair almost any damage to the human body, including freezing damage and senile debility or other cause of death. Hence we need only arrange to have our bodies, after we die, stored in suitable freezers against the time when science may be able to help us. No matter what kills us, whether old age or disease, and even if freezing techniques are still crude when we die, sooner or later our friends of the future should be equal to the task of reviving and curing us. Given the prevalence of articles published about cryonics in the mid-1960’s, and the relative popularity of Ettinger’s book among science buffs (even if few of them had actually read it), it is certainly possible that Walt Disney was aware of the potentiality of cryonic storage of humans. Whatever the possibilities, however, there is no documentary evidence to suggest that Walt Disney was interested in, or had even heard of, cryonics. Documentation of Disney’s alleged fascination with preserving or extending his life through cryonics did not appear until decades after his death, and what little information is available has predominantly been provided by some extremely questionable sources. Claims about Disney’s interest come primarily from two of the more recent Disney biographies: Robert Mosley’s 1986 effort,Disney’s World, and Marc Eliot’s 1993 entry, Walt Disney — Hollywood’s Dark Prince. Both books have been largely discredited for containing numerous factual errors and undocumented assertions, rendering them rather untrustworthy as sources of reliable background material. Eliot’s biography, which dwells unrelentingly on every salacious incident and rumor connected with Walt Disney’s name, is fairly easy to dismiss. Charitably described as “speculative,” it contains a single passage concerning Walt Disney’s alleged interest in cryonics: Disney’s growing preoccupation with his own mortality also led him to explore the science of cryogenics, the freezing of an aging or ill person until such time as the human body can be revived and restored to health. Disney often mused to Roy about the notion of perhaps having himself frozen, an idea which received … indulgent nods from his brother … Not surprisingly, the source behind this piece of information is nowhere to be found in Eliot’s notes. And as there is no record of Roy ever having spoken of his brother’s alleged interest in cryonics, Eliot’s “source” was likely nothing more than repetition of rumor. Mosley’s Disney’s World is also rather long on rumor and short on facts. The book has been described as “poorly researched and filled with inaccuracies”, a biography that seemed “to promote certain preset points of view, regardless of evidence”. The same critique goes on to say, “One of its central themes, for example, is Disney’s fascination with cryogenesis and the strong suggestion that his body was frozen following his death. It makes for titillating reading; however, few facts support Mosley’s claims”. Disney’s World paints a picture of an anxious Walt Disney desperately searching for a way to spring back to life in order to prevent or correct the horrible mistakes his followers were bound to make in turning his EPCOT dream into reality: [T]he chief problem that troubled Walt was the length of time it might take the doctors to perfect the process. How long would it be before the surgical experts could bring a treated cadaver back to working life? To be brutally practical, could it be guaranteed, in fact, that he could be brought back in time to rectify the mistakes his successors would almost certainly start making at EPCOT the moment he was dead? Mosley’s book is filled with repetitions of the claim that Walt Disney grew increasingly interested in cryonics as his health waned in late 1966, such as this paragraph: It was about this time that Walt Disney became acquainted with the experiments into the process known as cryogenesis, or what one newspaper termed “the freeze-drying of the human cadaver after death, for eventual resuscitation.” Mosley’s statements regarding Disney’s belief in the feasibility of cryonics are somewhat difficult to take seriously, given that his book includes such ludicrously erroneous (or fabricated) statements as: The surgeons had taken away his diseased lung to examine it, and then were going to preserve it. Walt was pleased when he heard that. He knew enough about cryogenesis by now to be aware that it was important to hold onto all the organs — just in case the surgeons needed to treat them before putting them back where they belonged. (Samples of tissue removed during cancer surgery are preserved in formaldehyde, a method of “preservation” which, while useful for microscopy studies, damages the tissue biologically. Organs removed from Disney by his surgeons could never be “put back where they belonged”, no matter what the treatment.) Mosley provides no source for his statements, other than to assert that Disney’s “closest colleagues and advisers” were “confident” that Walt Disney “eventually became convinced of cryogenesis as a viable medical process and was persuaded that, even in 1966, it was possible for a human being to have himself brought back to life after death”. In fact, these “close colleagues” of Disney’s turned out to be a few employees on the periphery of the Disney organization who had never spoken to Walt about cryonics, and were merely repeating the same decades-old rumor for Mosley’s benefit. On the other hand, someone much closer to Walt Disney, his daughter, Diane wrote in 1972: “There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that my father, Walt Disney, wished to be frozen. I doubt that my father had ever heard of cryonics.” Despite the persistent rumors, available documentation indicates that Walt Disney was in fact cremated. Although Disney’s preferences regarding the disposal of his body are not public record (instructions or provisions for his funeral and burial were not included in his will), other publicly-available material is entirely consistent with the claim that he was cremated: o Walt Disney publicly stated — ten years before his death — that he wished not to have a funeral. o Disney family members have confirmed that cremation was Walt’s wish. o Disney’s death certificate shows that he was cremated two days after his death. The name, license number, and signature of the enbalmer appearing on the death certificate are those of a real enbalmer who was employed at the Forest Lawn mortuary at the time. o A marked burial plot for Walt Disney (and other family members) can be found at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale (the logical resting grounds for someone whose cremation was handled by Forest Lawn’s mortuary), and court papers indicate that the Disney estate paid $40,000 to Forest Lawn for interment property. Since Disney’s demise, several unmremarkable events and circumstances surrounding his life and death have been combined to try to establish a pattern of mystery and secrecy concerning the disposal of his body. All of these events, however, have straightforward, non-mysterious explanations: o “Disney had a long preoccupation with death” o “Disney had a neurotic fear of death” Statements concerning Disney’s alleged preoccupation with death are generally attempts to sensationalize the topic by distorting the facts. Although he did worry about dying prematurely, Disney was not “obsessed with death”. Supposedly having been told by a fortune-teller that he would die when he was thirty-five, Disney reportedly brooded about his inevitable demise during occasional bouts of depression, even after he had long passed the allegedly fatal age. Contemplating one’s mortality is not an unusual behavior, and there is no evidence that Walt Disney did so to an excessive degree. William Poundstone quotes some ridiculous passages from Anthony Haden-Guest’s The Paradise Program to try to establish Disney’s preoccupation with death, detailing a “gruesome seven minute Mickey Mouse cartoon” made in 1933 in which “a mad scientist tries to cut off Pluto’s head and put in on a chicken. The cartoon in question is The Mad Doctor, which was nothing more than humorous spoof of 1930’s horror films. Even in the cartoon itself the “horrific” events are not portrayed as real: the whole episode turns out to be nothing more than a nightmare of Mickey’s. Although Poundstone wrote that the film was pulled from the Rank film library in 1970, it has been readily available on home video releases since then. o “The news of Disney’s death was deliberately delayed.” This claim that the announcement of Walt Disney’s death was deliberately withheld from the press for several hours has been made most persistently, presumably because Disney’s aides would have needed time to furtively whisk his body away from the hospital to the secret cryogenic chamber before the presence of reporters made the task impossible to accomplish in privacy. Leonard Mosley’s description of the event features some of more absurd stretches of truth made in this regard: And this is where the mystery begins. It was Walt himself who had asked Roy Disney to keep his illness secret, but the manner in which the world was apprised of his death remains surprising. In fact, it was not until hours after he was declared dead that an announcement was made. First came radio announcements, then a curt official notice informed the press and public that Walt Disney was no more. It added that there would be no funeral. He had already been cremated, the announcement said, and his ashes interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Only immediate family members had been present. It is true that Disney’s death was not officially announced to the press until several hours after it occurred at 9:30 AM on Thursday, December 15, 1966, but the reasons behind the delay were perfectly ordinary ones. First of all, Disney’s death would not have been announced immediately under any circumstances: Several family members had to be notified before a public announcement could be made, and Disney studio executives had to be located and informed that the head of their organization had passed away before the information would be released to the press. Additionally, the gravity of Disney’s illness had largely been kept a secret from the press, so there were no hordes of reporters crowding the hallways of St. Joseph Hospital, waiting for the inevitable announcement of his death. The reason for Disney’s original hospitalization had been announced to the press as “treatment of an old neck injury received while playing polo,” and when Disney re-entered the hospital for the final time two weeks before his death, the statement made to the press was that Disney was undergoing “a routine post-operative” checkup. Although it was certainly no secret that Disney was quite ill, the seriousness of his condition was not generally known. The extent to which the details of Walt Disney’s illness were kept from the press are evidenced by the newspapers reports of his death, which stated that his left lung had been removed during an operation on November 21 (an error which Poundstone repeats in Big Secrets). That operation had actually taken place two weeks earlier; November 21 was the date of his original post-surgery release from the hospital. So, given that relatives and studio heads had to be notified before any statements about Disney’s death were made to the press; that the media were not on a “Disney death watch,” busily preparing obituaries and tributes; and that communications in 1966 were certainly slower than they are today, it is not at all surprising that official news of Disney’s death did not reach the public until a few hours later. Mosley’s other statements, about Disney’s funeral and cremation, are just further examples of sloppy research on his part. Disney was not cremated until two days after his death; no press announcement made “hours after he was declared dead” claimed that he had already been cremated. o “The cause of Disney’s demise was never formally announced.” This statement is both inaccurate and irrelevant. The cause of Disney’s death was initially announced as being “acute circulatory collapse,” which meant simply that his heart had stopped beating. As facile as the official announcement may seem to those who know he “really” died of lung cancer, it does reflect the proximate cause of his death. This notion is borne out by the official death certificate, which lists “cardiac arrest” as the primary cause of death. The fact that cancer was what caused Disney’s heart to give out was, medically, of secondary importance. Official statements released to the press after Disney’s surgery (and before his death) had already revealed that a tumor had been found, necessitating the removal of a lung. Whether stated “officially” or not, it was quite clear to the public that Disney had died of lung cancer. In any case, what possible difference could it have made what Walt Disney died of? How could dissembling about the “real” cause of his death possibly have facilitated the goal of secretly storing his body in a cryonic chamber? o “Disney’s funeral services were held in secret.” Disney’s funeral was not “secret”; rather, it was private, conducted quickly and quietly at the Little Church of the Flowers in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Glendale at 5:00 PM on Friday, December 16 (the day after his death). No announcement of the funeral was made until after it had taken place, no associates or executives from Disney Studios were invited, and only immediate family members were in attendance. Forest Lawn officials refused to disclose any details of the funeral or disposition of the body, stating only that “Mr. Disney’s wishes were very specific and had been spelled out in great detail.”. None of this secrecy surrounding Disney’s funeral should be the least bit surprising to anyone, however. The biography The Story of Walt Disney (essentially an autobiography in which Disney’s own words and thoughts were attributed to his daughter Diane), written a decade before Disney’s death, noted that: [Walt] never goes to a funeral if he can help it. If he had to go to one it plunges him into a reverie which lasts for hours after he’s home. At such times he says, ‘When I’m dead I don’t want a funeral. I want people to remember me alive. '” Is it so remarkable that a man who had an aversion to funerals — and who had stated a ten years earlier that he didn’t want a public funeral — was sent off with a very quick and very private ceremony? If the clandestineness of the funeral had been intended to cover up the fact that Disney’s body had already been deposited in liquid nitrogen at a secret facility, there were certainly better, less obvious ways of accomplishing the deception: Disney could have been given a simple closed-casket ceremony, with nobody the wiser. o “Disney specified the public was never to be told the location of his grave.” Again, this claim is unsupported by any factual information and is not the least bit extraordinary. It is true that officials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park will not divulge the location of the Disney family plot. Many celebrities do request that the locations of their burial plots not be given out to visitors as a simple matter of privacy. The burial sites are not intended to be “secret,” however; if they were, they wouldn’t be marked and located on publicly-accessible grounds. Disney’s plot was not, as Mosley claimed, “already filled with family ashes from which the public would always be barred.” Disney’s plot is far from obtrusive, but it is located in an unrestricted part of the park and marked with a plaque identifying its occupants; anyone who so desires is perfectly free to visit, leave flowers, take photographs, etc. The plot was certainly not “already filled with family ashes” at the time of Disney’s interment, as for many it held the remains of only one other person: Ron Brown, a son-in-law who died the year after Disney did. In fact, according to the book Wills of the Rich and Famous, the interment property was not even chosen until September 19, 1967, making it rather difficult to believe that it could have been “already filled with family ashes.” If Disney was not really frozen, then how and when did this rumor originate? The exact origins of the rumor are unknown, but at least one Disney publicist has suggested that the story was started by a group of Disney Studio animators who “had a bizarre sense of humor.” The earliest known printed version of the rumor appeared in the magazine Ici Paris in 1969. Even if the origins of the story are unknown, it is certainly easy to see why the rumor is so believable. In the years immediately preceding his death, Disney was involved in a number of projects which cemented his image as a technical innovator in the public’s mind. Disneyland attractions such as the monorail, the House of the Future, the Voyage to the Moon; the introduction of audio-animatronic figures at the 1964 World’s Fair, and Disney’s plans for his “community of tomorrow” (EPCOT) in Florida made it easy to believe Walt Disney was ahead of everyone else in his planning, even when it came to his death. When you consider that the first cryonic suspension took place just a month after Disney’s death (Dr. James Bedford, a 73-year-old psychologist from Glendale, was suspended on January 12, 1967), it’s not so far-fetched to imagine that Disney might have made similar arrangements.",false,"Half a century onwards, the rumor that Walt Disney's body was put in cryonic storage remains one of the most enduring legends about the entertainment giant.","The claim that Walt Disney arranged to have himself frozen in a cryonic chamber upon his death is not supported by any documentary evidence.

14,6360,Judge: Treatment of Tennessee inmates with hep C improving.,"In a Monday ruling, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw noted that Tennessee has made a number of changes to improve treatment of the sometimes deadly disease within the past few months. Despite the availability of antiviral drugs that often cure the disease, prisons across the country have struggled to get funding for the drugs, which cost more than $10,000 per patient. Tennessee prisons saw at least 56 hepatitis C-related prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. Prisoners testified at the July trial that even after they became severely ill, and qualified for treatment under Tennessee Department of Correction rules, they were not given the crucial drugs. That’s because a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications Around 4,700 Tennessee prisoners are known to be infected with hepatitis C, but until recently the committee only considered the cases of about eight prisoners each month. The department is now working to increase that number to 160 per month. Crenshaw acknowledged the prisoners’ testimony in his ruling but noted the recent changes that corrections officials have made, including new guidelines for care released in May. Under the previous guidance, the committee would not even consider treatment for patients with hepatitis C viral infections, sometimes called HCV, unless they were already very sick. Dr. Zhiqiang Yao, an infectious disease specialist at East Tennessee State University, testified for the prisoners that the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with the antiviral medications, regardless of how sick they are. He said waiting to provide treatment can put patients with the infectious, liver-damaging disease at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer and death. Although the Correction Department’s new rules still prioritize the sickest patients, they do not preclude less sick patients from receiving treatment, Crenshaw wrote. He noted that Yao testified that prioritizing care for the sickest patients is understandable where there are limited resources and staffing. Other states have grappled with how to provide the expensive treatment. After a lawsuit, Michigan agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C beginning this month. Louisiana limited antiviral treatment for Medicaid patients and prisoners until earlier this summer. It now offers unlimited access thanks to an agreement with a drug provider where the state will pay a flat fee for unlimited medication for five years. Meanwhile, Crenshaw noted that the Tennessee Department of Correction’s prioritization guidance mirrors that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. New antiviral drugs that promise to cure most hepatitis C patients within weeks have only been available since 2011. Since then, the cost of the drugs has dropped from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for the simplest cases, according to the lawsuit. Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department’s chief medical officer, testified at trial that he recently requested and received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, or more than a third of Tennessee inmates currently known to be infected with hepatitis C. “Time will tell whether TDOC implements the 2019 HCV Guidance in the dedicated manner it has represented and continues to accelerate approval of inmates for treatment,” Crenshaw wrote. He concluded it would behoove the department to do so “lest treatment that is not grossly inadequate today be subject to that renewed claim in the future.”",true,A federal judge in Nashville ruled this week that Tennessee’s treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C is not grossly inadequate but warned the state to make good on its promises to treat more patients more quickly.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160.

The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment.

Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider.

The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases.

Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population.

The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160.\n\nThe ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment.\n\nOther states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases.\n\nDr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population.

A recent post on Neighbors, an app created by Ring — the company that makes video doorbells — claims that the United States military is using helicopters to ""spray pesticide against the Corona virus in the skies all over the country."" A map on the post indicates that the user shared it in San Diego. ""So you must stay indoors after twelve o’clock at night and remove all clothes which are outside,"" the post reads. ""When you hear the sounds of airplanes at night, it is for you to know that it is related to this matter (COVID-19)."" A reader sent us a screenshot of the post, which was subsequently shared on Snapchat, on March 23. The text of the post has also been shared on Facebook. (Screenshot from Snapchat) We’ve seen several other chain messages that make claims about the military’s actions against the coronavirus, so we decided to check this one out, too. There is no evidence that the U.S. military is using helicopters to spray coronavirus-killing pesticide on American communities. A similar hoax has been passed around in Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Egypt, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates. On March 22, President Donald Trump said during a press briefing that the federal government is deploying additional National Guard assistance to New York, California and Washington to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. During the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said the government is also working with the military to charter flights for Americans abroad. Meanwhile, Navy ships have been sent to New York and California to provide additional health care support. The Army Corps of Engineers is building more medical facilities. And, according to the Military Times, more than 8,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized in all 50 states. That’s a significant activation of the military within U.S. borders, but it’s a far cry from using helicopters to spray pesticides on cities across the country. In September, Rhode Island officials approved aerial spraying to kill mosquitoes, which had caused an outbreak of the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. Other states have taken similar actions, and the U.S. Air Force Reserve has an aerial spray program. But those efforts are aimed at limiting the populations of insects that carry diseases, not the diseases themselves. And while Chinese officials have used drones to disinfect surfaces potentially tainted by the coronavirus, experts told us there is no evidence that spraying pesticide from a helicopter would kill the virus on the ground in the U.S. ""That idea is pretty far-fetched,"" said Murray Isman, dean emeritus of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia, in an email. ""There are no pesticides that specifically target viruses, and general antimicrobials that might have any effect (bleach, alcohol) would have to be applied in ridiculously high volumes."" According to the Environmental Protection Agency, disinfectants qualify as ""antimicrobial pesticides"" since they are used to kill bacteria and viruses. The agency has listed dozens of products on its website that meet the criteria for use against the coronavirus. The chain message is inaccurate. We rate it . If you receive a chain message that you want us to fact-check, send a screenshot to [email protected].",false,There is no evidence the United States military is using helicopters to spray pesticide in an effort to kill the coronavirus.,"The article discusses a chain message that claims the United States military is using helicopters to spray pesticide against the coronavirus in the skies all over the country.

17,26768,Sanitizer will do nothing for the coronavirus.,"Health officials say one of the best ways Americans can prevent the spread of the 2019 coronavirus is to clean their hands. But should they use hand sanitizer? One popular image on Facebook says no. ""Hand sanitizer is anti-bacterial. The coronavirus is a virus,"" reads the post, which is a screenshot of a March 1 tweet. ""A bacteria and a virus is not (sic) the same. Wash your hands. Sanitizer will do nothing for the coronavirus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The post is wrong — health officials recommend the use of hand sanitizer to kill the coronavirus, known officially as COVID-19. The original Twitter user clarified that in a follow-up tweet, but the context was lost on Facebook. On its list of ways to prevent coronavirus infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to ""wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing."" If soap and water are not accessible, the CDC recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Although hand sanitizers are not effective against all viruses, the ones with high alcohol content have proven effective against some. Several studies indicate that alcohol-based sanitizers are effective against ""enveloped viruses,"" which include human coronaviruses. Since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December, the 2019 coronavirus has infected more than 88,000 people in 64 countries. In the United States, there have been 43 confirmed cases and six deaths, as of March 2, not including those repatriated to the country.

18,34779,Walter Reed Medical Center guidelines prohibit the use or distribution of religious items during visits with patients.,"Example: [Collected via e-mail, December 2011] The soldiers who wake up in Walter Reed Medical Center are in Maryland — not communist China. But under the Navy’s new rules, they may not know the difference! Navy officials have announced that “no religious items (including Bibles, reading material, and/or artifacts) are allowed to be given away or used during a visit.” The new orders are buried in a four-page document about patient care, which an Army officer forwarded to us in disbelief. Effective immediately, families, friends, and even pastors will have to check their beliefs at the door to visit one of the largest military hospitals in the United States. Summary: A guideline memo issued by the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in September 2011 stated that “religious items” (including Bibles) could not be used or given away during visits with patients at that facility. The rule was not enforced, however, and was rescinded four months later, hence the condition described in the above-quoted example no longer exists and is therefore outdated. Origins: On 14 September 2011, Col. C.W. Callahan, Chief of Staff of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, issued a memorandum headed “WOUNDED, ILL AND INJURED PARTNERS IN CARE GUIDELINES” with the expressed purpose of providing revised guidelines for the hospital’s patient visitation policies. Most of the memo dealt with routine matters such as setting visiting hours and maximum group sizes, but one item near the end of the memo caused a good deal of public outcry when it was made public: No religious items (i.e. Bibles, reading material, and/or artifacts) are allowed to be given away or used during a visit. The intent of that stipulation was claimed to be the protection of patients from unwanted proselytizing, but the memo was worded so broadly that it read as an absolute ban on visitors’ using Bibles or other religious materials during visits to Walter Reed Medical Center, even those brought by family members to receptive patients. After the issue became public, Walter Reed officials quickly issued statements proclaiming the policy as worded in the memo was incorrect, had not been enforced, and had since been rescinded. As the Navy Times reported of the controversy in December 2011: A section of the guidelines designed to protect patients from proselytizers was rescinded after Rep. Steve King of Iowa discussed it on the House floor, asserting it violated the First Amendment protecting free exercise of religion.The intent was to respect patients’ religious practices and preserve their privacy, explained hospital spokeswoman Sandy Dean. She said patients often are visited by volunteers from benevolent organizations as well as strangers, ranging from celebrities, politicians and well-meaning VIPs, and the guidelines were developed to respect patients’ own beliefs. “If the family, if friends, wanted to bring things in, it was fine,” Dean said. “The way the policy was written was incorrect. We are rewriting the policy,” she said. Dean said the guidelines are necessary because the hospital needs to protect its patients, who declare their religious preferences when they arrive. “We want to make sure that visitors are respecting our patients’ religious practices and culture,” she said. Hospital leaders are revising the policy carefully but she could not say when it would be complete. “We are having a lot of eyes on it to ensure it’s articulated correctly,” she said. Another memorandum dated 24 January 2012 canceled the earlier controversial instructions, and an information paper from May 2012 explained the situation the previous policy had attempted to address: The policy in question was established after receiving complaints from Warriors and their families at both Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center who were approached by unsolicited faith-based groups visiting the inpatient wards. Patients and families reported that these groups were proselytizing and making disparaging remarks about Warrior’s service, sometimes using threatening and condemning language. According to the patients, some visits were persistent and repeated.The WRNMMC policy was not intended to nor did it ever have the effect of limiting religious expression of patients. The policy as written was incorrect and should have been more thoroughly reviewed before its release. It has been rescinded. Family members have been and will always be allowed to bring religious materials and texts. Subsequently, the new “Patient Visitation Policy” WRNATMILMEDCEN INSTRUCTION 5720.4D was reissued on 24 January 2012 with all incorrect verbiage and implications removed.",mixture,"WRNMMC prides itself on embodying the principles of the “Patient and Family Care” philosophy, to include the spiritual and holistic health of our Wounded, Ill, Injured Warriors, and their families. The WRNMMC care paradigm finds the holistic and family elements of care to be important to the overall rehabilitation path of our patients. The Integrated Healthcare Delivery System, of which WRNMMC is an integral part, is bolstered by the combined holistic and spiritual capabilities of the integrated healthcare teams of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Public Health medical establishments who remain dedicated to enhancing the holistic, mental, physical, and spiritual health needs of our Wounded, Ill, and Injured Warriors, their families and our beneficiaries.","The claim that Walter Reed Medical Center prohibits the use or distribution of religious items during visits with patients is true, but outdated. In September 2011, a guideline memo was issued stating that ""religious items"" including Bibles could not be used or given away during visits. However, this rule was not enforced and was rescinded four months later. The intention behind the rule was to protect patients from unwanted proselytizing, but it was worded too broadly and caused public outcry. Walter Reed officials quickly clarified that the policy as stated in the memo was incorrect, had not been enforced, and had been rescinded. The hospital spokesperson explained that the guidelines were developed to respect patients' own beliefs and that visitors were allowed to bring religious materials if they wished.

19,12694,It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.,"U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, is a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act but opposed his party’s health care plan. The ACA passed under President Barack Obama included the expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health coverage for about 74 million poor Americans. (Yoho’s state of Florida rejected the expansion.) Yoho, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, says the law has driven people to Medicaid, a program he described as a worldwide failure. ""With the Affordable Care Act, what’s happened is, all these people have been running to Medicaid, and it’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care,"" he said in a March 14 interview on PBS, about a week and a half before the Republicans canceled a vote on their health care plan. Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney walked back the congressman’s statement somewhat when we asked for evidence that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world. ""Hindsight being 20/20, the congressman didn’t mean to use the word ‘worst,’ "" Kaveney said. ""The congressman was pointing out that since the implementation of ACA, health care trends have not improved."" Kaveney added: ""To say that Medicaid expansion under ACA has resulted in better health outcomes would be a very debatable point."" Experts we interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. Leighton Ku, an expert on health policy at George Washington University, said that Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, but research about outcomes comes with caveats. ""There is no question -- and there is a lot of research -- that Medicaid improves poor people's access to health care, in terms of seeing a doctor, getting medications, etc.,"" he told PolitiFact. ""The problem with comparing health outcomes is that Medicaid recipients start out sicker, both because they are poor, but also because people who are sick really need to get Medicaid to get access to care, while healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care."" Studies about Medicaid Yoho was referring to two articles in 2017 by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Cass argued that Medicaid studies show that the program doesn’t improve public health. But there aren't studies comparing its health outcomes to other industrialized countries. ""Whether people on Medicaid have better or worse outcomes than people in other countries doesn’t tell you anything about the effectiveness of Medicaid,"" Cass told PolitiFact. ""The question is whether there are public programs that have as little effect on outcomes relative to the baseline of no-insurance in that country."" Let’s look at the studies that Cass cited, some of which we have reviewed before. Oregon study: Cass wrote that a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon showed ""recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years."" The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment compared about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Harvard study: Harvard researchers compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York with other states that made no change in the 2000s. ""Only one of the three achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality,"" Cass wrote. One of the study’s authors, Ben Sommers, said when examining each state individually only the largest state -- New York -- was significant on its own. Sommers has since done additional research and found that deaths from causes most treatable with timely medical care — such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes — did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. (Sommers did part-time work for the Obama administration.) Study on life expectancy and income: Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study was not about Medicaid, but found differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals is not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. ""Our study shows that behavioral conditions such as smoking and obesity are very important in mortality,"" study author Raj Chetty told PolitiFact. ""The study does not imply that Medicaid is not important, let alone that it has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world."" Cass cited one positive health impact from Medicaid: He wrote that it ""may have significant positive effects on pregnant women and young children."" Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the big picture for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Kaiser reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the law. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. More research was needed, however, to know the effects on health outcomes. Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor of social services administration, said that Medicaid, much like private insurance, is a weaker tool in improving health outcomes than experts would like to see. But Medicaid critics sometimes omit context about the program for the poor. ""Many studies that compare Medicaid recipients to others find negative associations between Medicaid and health for the simple reason that Medicaid serves individuals facing the greatest social and health risks,"" he said. ""These cannot be interpreted as identifying a harmful causal role of Medicaid."" Our ruling Yoho said ""It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care."" Yoho’s spokesman said that he didn’t mean to use the word ""worst."" His evidence focused on studies about Medicaid outcomes within the United States with no comparison to other countries. Yoho intended to argue that Medicaid under the ACA hasn’t improved health outcomes. Kaiser examined multiple studies and found Medicaid expansion improves access to care and self-reported health, but additional research is needed to determine effects on health outcomes. As far as Yoho’s original statement.",false,"Yoho said ""It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.""

However, when asked for evidence to support his claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world, Yoho's spokesman walked back the statement, saying that Yoho meant to point out that health care trends have not improved since the implementation of the ACA.

While Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, research about outcomes comes with caveats. Medicaid recipients start out sicker, and healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care.

One article discussed a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon, which found that recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health.

In conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence. While there are studies that suggest Medicaid may not significantly improve physical health outcomes, it does improve access to care and self-reported health. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of Medicaid on health outcomes.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

However, when asked for evidence to support his claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world, Yoho's spokesman walked back the statement, saying that Yoho meant to point out that health care trends have not improved since the implementation of the ACA.\n\nExperts interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. While Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, research about outcomes comes with caveats. Medicaid recipients start out sicker, and healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care.\n\nYoho referred to two articles by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, to support his claim. One article discussed a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon, which found that recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health.\n\nAnother article by Cass cited a Harvard study that compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine, and New York with other states that made no change. The study found that only New York achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, the study's author, Ben Sommers, has since done additional research and found that deaths from treatable causes did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well.\n\nCass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study found that differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals are not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care.\n\nResearchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. However, more research is needed to determine the effects on health outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence. While there are studies that suggest Medicaid may not significantly improve physical health outcomes, it does improve access to care and self-reported health. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of Medicaid on health outcomes.\nClaim: It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.\nThe claim veracity: false.\nUsing only the context provided, explain why the claim veracity is false.\n""}]","The claim made by U.S. Rep.

20,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva recently introduced legislation intended to make it much more difficult for the state Department of Children, Youth and Families to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. He said he was moved by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who was the subject of a column by The Providence Journal’s Bob Kerr. Alahverdian says he endured years of abuse and neglect in two out-of-state residential facilities where he was sent by DCYF. He has formed his own nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care. He has also filed state and federal lawsuits stemming from his alleged mistreatment. DaSilva said in a General Assembly news release that Rhode Island has the resources to provide children with the treatment they need within the state. DaSilva said he is concerned about the well-being of children in state care and also about keeping taxpayer dollars in the state. ""We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, to house our own state residents,"" DaSilva said. ""It just doesn’t make sense, especially in these dire economic times."" Among the children the DCYF takes into its custody are those who are victims of abuse or neglect caused by their primary caretakers, those who are in the juvenile justice system and ordered by courts to have access to rehabilitative care, and those with emotional, behavioral or developmental challenges who need out-of-home care and treatment and whose parents give DCYF temporary custody, according to DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin. The DCYF has said it is working to reduce its dependence on residential treatment programs, both in Rhode Island and in other states. So we wondered whether the agency is still spending as much as DaSilva says on such placements. We asked DaSilva where he got his information and he referred us to a website called the Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal. It shows the agency’s expenditures in various categories such as personnel and foster care. The top expenditure is residential services. For fiscal year 2010, for instance, the portal shows the state spent $117 million for residential care for youth in DCYF custody, which also includes costs for foster home placements and varous community services Much of that money was spent on local services such as Child and Family Services of Newport County or Ocean Tides, a residential treatment program in Narragansett for male juvenile offenders. The DCYF also budgets an additional $22.4 million this year for youths sent to the Rhode Island Training School. But the website shows that millions of dollars go to out-of-state programs. For example, Mass Mentor Inc., which provides services at several Massachusetts locations to children with developmental disabilities was paid $376,829 in the first quarter. During the same quarter, the Bennington School in Vermont was paid $77,769 and the Glen Mills School in Pennsylvania got $59,246. We asked Kevin J. Aucoin, interim director of DCYF, for more data. He said that this fiscal year, the DCYF expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities, most of them in nearby states. Aucoin says the spending on residential programs has been declining. In fiscal year 2007, for example, the state spent $85.4 million for 1,102 children. In that year, it spent $18.4 million to send 154 children out of state. All residential placements are expected to be reduced as the agency adopts a new model of care that focuses on keeping families together. Aucoin said the DCYF sends children out of state for specialized treatments not offered by in-state providers. Those include multiple psychiatric diagnoses and severe and profound developmental disabilities. The majority, he said, have severe aggressive behaviors. Some may be youth with significant ""sexual offending behaviors."" Aucoin said children are placed out of state only with approval of the Family Court and only after the agency demonstrates there is no adequate program in-state. So it appears the only fault with DaSilva’s claim is it is too conservative. Instead of spending the ""hundreds of thousands,"" DaSilva claims, the state actually expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs. We find his claim to be .",true,Rep. DaSilva says R.I. pays hundreds of thousands of dollars for out-of-state care for children in state custody,"State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment.

DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times.

The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs.

DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements.

Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs.

In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative. The DCYF expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs, indicating that his concern about the expenditure of taxpayer dollars is valid.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

21,10103,"Antibiotics speed up recovery from ear infections in young children, studies show","This story did not discuss the costs of antibiotic prescriptions to the individual or costs of policies on our health care system and society. We think it should have. Although a bit more detail would have been useful on the findings from both studies, the story does provide an account of the absolute rate of symptom relief after 7 days for antibiotic (80%) and placebo-treated (74%) patients, which is the expectation for this criterion. It also provides valuable expert commentary on how parents can put these benefits into context vs. the risk of harm and the likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don’t receive antibiotics. Although we’re tempted to give this story a pass for providing a detailed list of potential harms and a better explanation of why limiting antibiotic use can be beneficial (it can “increase the chance the future use of antibiotics will be effective”), the expectation here is that the story will provide a quantitative estimate if available. These figures were easily obtainable from the original studies, and should have been provided. This story takes a much more careful approach to examining the evidence than the competing Washington Post blog. Examples: No disease-mongering in this story. The prominence of the independent voices in this story is a real strength of the coverage. It was nice to see lengthy comments from Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, who literally wrote the book (or at least edited it) on evidence-based treatment of ear infections. There’s also input from a doctor who is a stronger proponent of early antibiotic use. The story adequately describes the rationale supporting watchful waiting, which is the primary alternative to antibiotics for an acute ear infection. The availability of antibiotics to treat ear infections is not in question. The story correctly characterized the novelty of the research: it establishes that antibiotics are more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis, and supports current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to such children. The story features comments from two independent experts, so we can be sure it’s not based on a news release.",true,"Of four stories we reviewed on this study (Washington Post blog, NPR, Los Angeles Times as well), two were blog pieces – this one and the Washington Post entry. This CNN effort was better in most ways than the opinionated blog from the Washington Post. It earned points for sticking to the evidence and providing independent perspectives about the value of antibiotics for treating childhood ear infections. We also applaud the story’s focus on shared decision-making between doctors and parents when managing ear infections. A bit more detail on costs and harms would have added value to this excellent story. Wanting the best for a child with an ear infection doesn’t necessarily mean opting for the most aggressive treatment. As Dr Richard Rosenfeld puts it in this story: “Medicine is about gray zones and balancing the risks and benefits. Parents and doctors need to understand what the benefits and what the downside of treatments are.” While the research discussed here confirms that antibiotics are likely to be beneficial for certain children with ear infections, no study can take the place of a careful consideration of individual circumstances. According to Rosenfeld: “It’s an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician.”","Two studies have found that antibiotics can speed up recovery from ear infections in young children. The studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that children who were given antibiotics had a higher rate of symptom relief after 7 days compared to those who were given a placebo. The absolute rate of symptom relief was 80% for the antibiotic-treated patients and 74% for the placebo-treated patients. The studies also found that antibiotics were more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis. These findings support current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to children with ear infections.

The article provides expert commentary on the benefits of antibiotics for ear infections, as well as the risks and likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don't receive antibiotics. It emphasizes the importance of putting the benefits of antibiotics into context and considering the risk of harm. The article also mentions that limiting antibiotic use can increase the chance that future use of antibiotics will be effective.

The article does not discuss the costs of antibiotic prescriptions to the individual or the costs of policies on the healthcare system and society.

The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.\n\nThe dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city.

22,8068,"With U.S. hit by virus, China courts Latin America with medical diplomacy.","At the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits. The donations, welcomed by Fernandez’s government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States. From Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems. There have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths. Although South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere. “Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,” a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. “We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.” As trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail. In Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef. As the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina’s new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations. Days later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital. “China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!” the embassy said on Twitter. The help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund. “This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,” a spokesman for Argentina’s foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations. China’s aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say. Luo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would “ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.” While Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic ‘the Chinese virus,’ China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations. “It’s remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China’s own commanding control of information that it’s been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,” said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. Myers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world’s production slows. “This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,” she said. The United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis. Before the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available. In Latin America, China’s hands-on approach has been well received. Chile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile’s health minister said. In Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries. In Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support. “Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!” the country’s Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits. In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance. Chinese firms, including Alibaba (BABA.N), Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction and the Bank of China have pledged donations around the region. Back in Argentina, Washington is keen to show that it also wants to help. “We plan this week to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires told Reuters, adding the country was “looking at the possibility of additional donations.”",true,"As Argentina was scrambling to introduce emergency measures to insulate its ailing economy from the coronavirus last week, the Chinese ambassador paid a visit to the home of President Alberto Fernandez to discuss an offer.","China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is competing for influence against the United States.

The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink.

24,10418,Viagra may help heart effects of muscular dystrophy,"Even though this line of research is preliminary, the story should have noted that typical treatment for pulmonary hypertension patients who use the Revatio brand of sildenafil costs more than $15,000 a year and that since the drug does not cure the disease, this sort of treatment might well continue indefinitely. The story has just a vague reference to treating heart symptoms. It does not offer any specific data, not even about the mice in this trial. The story fails to mention any of harms of sildenafil, which include: * sudden severe loss of vision (see below for more information) * blurred vision * sudden decrease or loss of hearing * ringing in ears * erection that is painful or lasts longer than 4 hours * dizziness or lightheadedness * fainting * chest pain * worsening shortness of breath * itching or burning during urination * rashSildenafil may also interact with other prescription drugs. What’s more, the story failed to note that the continual administration of sildenafil over many months used in this study (and the sort of life-long daily treatment that would be envisioned in human patients) is more like the way the drug is used in patients with pulmonary hypertension and completely different from the occasional doses of the Viagra brand form of the drug used by men to treat erectile dysfunction. This story included some caveats, such as the fact that researchers don’t understand how the drug works in the lab animals and that the mice used in the experiment have “a condition similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy,” not the actual disease. However, any story reporting the results of animal experiments should alert readers to the fact that very few treatments that emerge out of animal testing ultimately pass human testing. The story points out that Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects about one in 3,500 males. The story gets credit for reporting that the study was funded by the NIH and non-profit groups. But it does not appear that anyone was interviewed for this story, neither researchers nor independent experts. The quotes are excerpts from the journal article. The story does not tell readers about how the heart problems of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are currently managed, nor does it offer any explanation of how sildenafil treatment might compare to standard therapy. The story reports that sildenafil is the drug in Viagra, used to treat erectile dysfunction, and also Revatio, which is used to treat pulmonary hypertension. The story would have been better if it referred to the active ingredient in Viagra, rather than Viagra itself, and had pointed out that to treat heart problems, the drug would be given continually (as it is for pulmonary hypertension) and not just occasionally as it is when used to treat erectile dysfunction. The story reports the new finding of this study in its next-to-last sentence, while leading with old news. The researchers wrote that to their knowledge “this is the first report of rapid reversal by a drug treatment of the functional symptoms seen in the established cardiac dysfunction that occurs in mdx mice.” But the story lead is that the drug “might help treat heart symptoms of muscular dystrophy”… something that has been reported previously not only in mice, but is already being tested in people. This story does not appear to put this latest study in the proper context of other experiments. Reference:Revatio for Heart Disease in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (REVERSE-DMD) The story quotes the journal article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It does not appear to rely only on a news release.",false,"Readers should care that this report just briefly summarizes one experiment using the active ingredient in Viagra to treat heart problems in mice that were genetically modified to have a condition similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy… without interviewing either the researchers or independent experts… and also failing to note that the drug is already being tested in people that have the actual disease.

26,11330,Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk,"This story did not include any cost estimates for fish or docosaheaenoic acid (DHA) containing supplements. It also did not include an estimate for the amount of supplements that would be needed to result in the plasma levels of DHA seen to be associated with lower dementia risk. Early in the story, it mentioned that the research involved 899 people and that 99 people developed dementia during the course of the study. This works out to a total incidence of dementia of 11%, something that was not explicitly stated in the story. The piece then went on to discuss that that two or more servings of fish a week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%. This is a relative risk reduction. Before readers can put that in context, they would really need to have the absolute risk of developing dementia. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) While it is true that the original source piece for this story did not contain this information, the story could have raised the question. The story mentioned potential harms from fish oil consumption and included speculation on potential harms from fish consumption. This story reported on the observations reported in one recently published paper which found that there appeared to be a lower risk of developing demnetia for individuals with the highest level of plasma levels of docosaheaenoic acid (DHA). It mentioned that the study reported on has been published in the Archives of Neurology, that the data were part of the Framingham Heart Study and that the individuals were followed for an average of 9 years. It would have been useful to more clearly describe for readers the design of the prospective study giving rise to the results reported on. A blood sample was taken from people who did not have dementia, a diet history was collected from about half of the people, then they were follwed for an average of 9 years to determine the incidence of dementia that was observed. There did not appear to be a dose response in terms of the protective effect of DHA, but rather a reduced risk for developing dementia was seen only in those with the highest DHA levels. Plasma DHA levels were seen to correlate with the number of servings of fish or the amount of DHA consumed. The story also could have described other potential confounders that may have contributed to the results. There are other behaviors that are associated with reduced dementia that may be more common in those who eat more fish (social activities, better dietary variety, or others). This story did not appear to disease monger. This story was based on information from an original research study and included quotes from the study senior author as well as material from an editorial about the research study. This story did not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer disease. A brief statement about lack of strong evidence would help guide readers in this regard. This story mentioned that omega-3 fatty acid docosaheaenoic acid (DHA) was found in fatty fish, as well as supplements in the form of fish oil or DHA. It was good to point out that neither DHA or fish oild supplements have FDA approval for prevention of dementia. The story curiously mentioned that it was also found in some meats. However, the only tissues in which DHA is found in significant quantities are the brain, retina, and testes – which are not frequently consumed by people. Thus the story ought not to have included 'some meats' as a source of DHA. The story reported that the results of the current study were consistent with earlier data. Does not appear to rely on a press release.",mixture,"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it is information that a reader should be aware of. The headline of the story – ""Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk"" – is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled ""Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease"" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease.

27,26287,"If masks prevent coronavirus, governors would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them.","Health officials and governors in states hit hard by COVID-19 are recommending masks to help contain the spread of the virus. But if masks really work, a Facebook post asks rhetorically, why aren’t governors using them more in jails and prisons that have become COVID-19 hotspots? The post — accompanying images of governors Mario Cuomo of New York, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California — claims the three Democrats have ""released thousands of dangerous prisoners into the public to kill innocent people and cause stress to our citizens,"" and that the governors ""make"" citizens wear masks. ""If the masks actually work to prevent COVID-19,"" the post continues, ""then why didn’t we just hand them out to all inmates … instead of releasing them to prevent the spread?"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It is inaccurate on several fronts. Medical experts now agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the states cited in the post have distributed masks to inmates. Meanwhile, states that are releasing inmates are considering the potential danger to the public in deciding which ones to release. Across the nation in response to the coronavirus, many more inmates are being released from local jails — which hold people charged with crimes or convicted of low-level crimes — than from prisons, which mostly hold people convicted of felonies. That’s according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, and the New York Times. (In Florida, an inmate released from the Hillsborough County jail, where he was being held on nonviolent drug charges, was charged with second-degree murder the next day.) Some are being released from prisons. In New York, Michigan and California, thousands of prison inmates have been released in response to the coronavirus. The Facebook claim goes too far in characterizing them all as posing a threat to kill. In New York, Cuomo announced in April that pregnant women with less than six months remaining on their sentences for nonviolent offenses would be released from prison. The state announced in March that up to 1,100 inmates being held in local jails for low-level parole violations and deemed not a danger to the public would be released to stem the flow of coronavirus cases in the correctional system. Michigan is releasing 200 prison inmates per week because of the coronavirus, WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich., reported on April 14. The state is looking to first release inmates eligible for parole who are nonviolent offenders older than 60 with health issues, though no offenses are off-limits, the report said. California announced in March that it planned to release as many as 3,500 prison inmates by expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with 60 days or less left on their sentences. Correctional and detention facilities pose ""unique challenges"" in combating COVID-19, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Inmates live, work and eat in close settings, heightening the potential for the virus to spread. The virus can be brought into the facility in many ways, including through staff, medical professionals or others who enter from the outside. And options for isolating inmates are limited, the CDC notes. Across the country, more than 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 of them have died, according to the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that reports on criminal justice. Staff and inmates are required to wear masks amid large outbreaks: New York: More than 1,200 prison staff have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the state. The Department of Corrections requires all staff to wear face masks while on duty and supplies all inmates with surgical-type masks. Michigan: There are more than 2,100 COVID-19 infections among prisoners and Michigan ranks third for the number of prisoner cases, according to the Marshall Project. Each prison employee and inmate has received three masks that can be laundered and worn again, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections. Staff are expected to wear a mask during their entire shift, and prisoners are expected to wear masks except while eating, sleeping or showering. California: More than 430 cases of COVID-19, including five deaths, have been confirmed at the California Institution for Men in Chino, with tents being set up to provide more space and treatment for inmates, the Sacramento Bee reported. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it provides masks and hand sanitizer to all staff and prisoners. While masks alone cannot stop the spread of the coronavirus, health officials agree that facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, help slow the spread of the virus, as we’ve reported. The CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering while out in public and in areas where social distancing isn’t possible. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snugly and are made of multiple layers. New research since the start of the coronavirus outbreak supports the use of masks. For correctional facilities, a May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with physical distancing, movement restrictions and other measures. ""Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons, correctional and detention facility staff members, and the communities to which they return,"" the report said. A Facebook post claimed that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them. Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus. New York, Michigan and California prisons are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response. Inmates in those states are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19 — mostly nonviolent offenders or those who aren’t seen as a safety threat. We rate the statement . Correction, June 8, 2020: Michigan had more than 2,100 state prisoners with COVID-19, not more than 2,100 state prisoner COVID-19 deaths.",false,"Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus. Despite a claim on Facebook, New York, Michigan and California prisons all are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response. Certain groups of inmates are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19. They include pregnant women with less than six months left on sentences for nonviolent offenses, and other inmates who are either over 60 with health issues or months away from being eligible for parole.","The claim that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan, and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them is inaccurate. Medical experts agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the virus, and the states mentioned in the claim have distributed masks to inmates. Additionally, the claim suggests that all released inmates pose a threat to kill, which is an exaggeration. In response to the coronavirus, more inmates are being released from local jails than from prisons, and states are considering the potential danger to the public when deciding which inmates to release. In New York, pregnant women with nonviolent offenses and inmates held for low-level parole violations were released. Michigan is releasing nonviolent offenders over the age of 60 with health issues, and California is expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with less than 60 days left on their sentences. 

Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in combating COVID-19, as inmates live, work, and eat in close settings, increasing the potential for the virus to spread. Across the country, over 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 have died. In response to outbreaks, staff and inmates are required to wear masks in New York, Michigan, and California prisons. The CDC recommends the use of facial coverings, including homemade masks, to slow the spread of the virus. A May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with other measures, for correctional facilities.

In conclusion, the claim that governors would have given masks to prison inmates if they prevent coronavirus is inaccurate. Masks have been distributed to inmates in the mentioned states, and inmates are being released as a measure to limit the spread of COVID-19, primarily focusing on nonviolent offenders or those who are not seen as a safety threat.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Sanofi and Regeneron said they expect the lower-priced Praluent to be available for pharmacies to order in early March. They said the new price should improve patient access and result in lower out-of-pocket costs for U.S. consumers. Praluent and Repatha belong a class of injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attacks and death. Sales of both have been severely constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access put up by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs. They were approved in 2015 with initial list prices of more than $14,000 a year. In March of last year, Regeneron and Sanofi said that they would be willing to charge less for their drug if insurers agreed to reduce barriers for high-risk heart patients. A few months later they struck a deal with Express Scripts, now part of Cigna Corp, to make the drug available to that company’s customers at a price in the range of $4,500 to $6,600 a year. The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other developed countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world’s most lucrative market for manufacturers. Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.

30,12749,On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams took to the opinion pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer last week to defend himself from criticism that he reversed his stance on the individuals who have been deemed ""juvenile lifers"" in the criminal justice system. Williams, a Democrat who is finishing out his second term as district attorney and will not seek re-election, apparently took issue with an early March Inquirer piece that indicated the DA had changed his previous stance on offering the chance of parole to those convicted of homicide when they were juveniles. In the piece, the Inquirer reported Williams and his staff intend to seek sentences of life without parole for at least three of the 300 Philadelphia juvenile lifers whose sentences are under review. The district attorney wrote in that letter to the editor published last week that ""the article is contradicted by the paper's prior reporting"" and that his ""approach to these cases is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court."" So did Williams reverse his stance or not? We decided to put it to the test on our Flip-O-Meter, which specifically tracks whether politicians have gone back on their promises. Let’s look first at what Williams’ stance on juvenile lifers was, and why it’s been of interest over the last several years. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that it’s a violation of the Eighth Amendment for states to require a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for individuals convicted of committing homicide before they turned 18. The court ruled those sentences should be ""uncommon"" and reserved for ""the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption."" By the end of 2012, the Pennsylvania legislature passed new sentencing requirements for juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder, ranging from a 20-years-to-life sentence to a 35-years-to-life sentence, depending on degree and how old the person was when the crime was committed. That new legislation applied only to new sentences handed down after the Miller decision. But things got complicated last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision to prohibit mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles would apply retroactively. That set off a chaotic process in the criminal justice system that’s being resolved by district attorneys, judges and criminal defense attorneys across the state resentencing individuals according to new requirements, but largely leaving it up to judge’s discretion to make a final determination on each individual. There were about 480 juvenile lifers across the state system; 300 of those are from Philadelphia. Last summer, Williams said in an Inquirer interview that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel."" ""As long as I'm the D.A.,"" he said, ""we will not be asking for cases going forward for life without the possibility of parole for people under the age of 18 because of the same exact reasons articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller."" The promise earned Williams praise from progressive groups, and he was even lauded in a New York Times editorial that ended with: ""Now that Mr. Williams has put that principle into practice, district attorneys in other counties with large numbers of juvenile lifers have a clearer path to follow."" In the same Inquirer interview from last year, Williams said ""I've got a lot of people who are tweeting every day about juvenile lifers without parole."" Some of them he even responded to. On June 3, 2016, the district attorney tweeted to someone asking questions about his policy: ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He even doubled down when the person responded, asking: ""does that mean the Philly DAs office will not seek LWOP (life without parole) in any of those 300 cases?"" Williams tweeted back: ""just keep reading my last tweet."" So at the beginning of this month, the Inquirer wrote that it appeared Williams’ stance had shifted. Journalist Samantha Melamed reported Williams’ office, in a letter to a federal court, indicated it intends to seek life without parole in at least three of the cases it had reviewed so far. Officials from Williams’ office confirmed that this week, saying it’s so far made 96 offers, three of which were for life without parole. They refused to provide any information about those three cases, saying the offers are still under consideration by defense attorneys and the final determination will be made by a judge. The Inquirer reported one of the individuals who the DA’s office is recommending life without parole for is Andre Martin, who was 15 when he shot and killed police officer John Trettin in 1976. From the story: ""According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project."" Following that March Inquirer story about Williams’ apparent shifting stance, Williams wrote in a letter to the editor that there was no change in his stance and quoted the Inquirer’s original June 2016 piece that read: ""[Williams] said he won't rule out life without parole in the most heinous cases, but he has taken heed of the Supreme Court's opinion, in Miller, that neuroscience shows teens' brains are not fully formed, reducing their culpability."" Melamed said the Inquirer stands by its reporting, which is ""why the district attorney’s claim appeared in the form of a letter to the editor rather than a correction."" Williams’ chief of staff Kathleen Martin said in an interview this week that ""he hopes or expects not to have a lot of murderers who were juveniles remain, but in certain circumstances, including heinous crimes, that might in fact happen."" She described the office’s process for reviewing each of the juvenile lifer cases, saying it’s assigned a team of assistant district attorneys and other stakeholders to review every case, starting with the oldest ones. They’re seeking out surviving family members of victims, combing through old case files and reviewing information from the Department of Corrections about how the inmates have operated in prison. After that process, the team determined that they’ll request life in prison without the chance of parole for at least three juvenile lifers from Philadelphia. When PolitiFact asked Martin, Williams’ chief of staff, about whether or not this move conflicts with Williams’ past statements saying ""all"" 300 individuals would have a chance at parole, she said the three inmates in question still do have that chance because ""the judge is always going to have a final determination."" But that would go against what the DA’s office is requesting. Martin also said Williams’ original quote to the Inquirer that he wanted ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" was referring to his goals ""moving forward"" in sentencing new juveniles. ""It’s clear that the DA had a goal, but in the most heinous occasions, that goal cannot always be met,"" Martin said. ""There are just unfortunately some cases in which the best interest of the community at large is that certain people remain in custody."" Our ruling District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.

In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. Williams initially stated that he would not seek life without parole for individuals under 18, but a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that his stance had changed. Williams responded with a letter to the editor, stating that his approach is consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court.

The article explains that the issue of juvenile lifers became complicated when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision, which prohibited mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles, would apply retroactively. This led to a process of resentencing individuals across the state, with judges having the final determination on each case.

The Inquirer reported that Williams' office intends to seek life without parole for at least three of the cases it has reviewed so far. Williams' chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, stated that while Williams hopes not to have many juvenile murderers remain in custody, there are certain circumstances, such as heinous crimes, where life without parole may be necessary.

PolitiFact questioned whether this move conflicts with Williams' previous statements that all 300 individuals would have a chance at parole. Martin argued that the judge would have the final determination, but this contradicts what the DA's office is requesting.

The article concludes by stating that Williams' original goal was to give all juvenile lifers some chance of parole, but in the most heinous cases, this goal may not be met. The DA's office argues that Williams' stance has not changed, as he always acknowledged that there could be exceptions.

Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding Williams' stance on parole for juvenile lifers and the discrepancy between his previous statements and the actions of his office.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

31,24796,The House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases.,"Republicans have large philosophical differences with the $819 billion economic stimulus package that passed the House on Jan. 28, 2009, and they have tried to discredit the plan by singling out relatively small spending proposals they see as inappropriate. One of the most widely cited claims from Republican leaders has been that the stimulus plan includes millions for sexually transmitted disease education. On the day of the the House vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release in the districts of 29 freshman House Democrats, chastising them for supporting a massive spending plan that the NRCC said includes $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs. A version of the news release circulating in Florida, for example, begins, ""Rep. Alan Grayson (FL-08) and Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (FL-24) are set to cast their vote today on a so-called 'stimulus' package, which has shattered the trillion dollar mark. The question is: Will Alan Grayson and Suzanne Kosmas still support the massive spending bill now that it has become public that the House Democrats' so-called 'stimulus' has been stuffed with an astonishing $335 million to fund prevention programs of sexually transmitted diseases?"" Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip, had been making the same point for days, including in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 23. But the STD spending issue gained considerable momentum as a Republican attack after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it at the top of its popular political Web page on Jan. 28. So is there really STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats on Jan. 28? Yes, there is. In a section of the plan that includes funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs, as jointly determined by the Secretary and the Director."" In an interview on CBS's Early Show on Jan. 29, the day after the House passed the stimulus package, anchor Maggie Rodriguez asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi how $335 million in STD prevention would stimulate the economy. Said Pelosi: ""I'll tell you how. ... I'm a big believer in prevention. And we have — there's a part of the bill, on the health side of it, that is about prevention. It's about it being less expensive to the states to do these prevention measures."" We note that while the NRCC news release specifically calls out House Democrats for the STD spending, the Senate version of the bill also includes it — in fact, slightly more. A portion of the stimulus plan approved by the Senate Appropriations committee on Jan. 27 states that ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" A committee report on the bill backs up the HIV and STD prevention spending with this analysis: ""CDC estimates that approximately 19 million new STD infections occur annually in the United States, with 1 in 4 teenage girls currently infected. This epidemic is estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $15,000,000,000 annually, all of which is preventable. The Committee has included $400,000,000 for testing and prevention of these conditions. The Committee intends that funds be used for grants to States for testing activities, and the prevention of STD infections like chlamydia that have been increasing dramatically in recent years."" We're not going to wade into the debate over whether the spending is appropriate for an economic stimulus bill. We're only ruling on whether there is $335 million in the House version of the bill for STD prevention programs. We note that while the proposed $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis prevention programs, which are not always transmitted sexually. So we find the claim .",true,STD spending is in the economic stimulus plan,"The claim is that the House Democrats' stimulus package includes $335 million to fund prevention programs for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). This claim has been widely cited by Republican leaders as a way to discredit the stimulus plan. The National Republican Congressional Committee circulated a news release criticizing 29 freshman House Democrats for supporting a spending plan that includes this funding. Republican Representative Eric Cantor also made this point in an interview with Fox News. The issue gained momentum after the Drudge Report posted an alert about it on its website.

The article confirms that there is indeed STD prevention spending in the stimulus bill passed by House Democrats. The bill states that ""not less than $335,000,000 shall be used as an additional amount to carry out domestic HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually-transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis prevention programs."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended this spending by stating that prevention measures are less expensive for states in the long run.

The article also mentions that the Senate version of the bill includes slightly more funding for STD prevention. The Senate Appropriations committee approved a portion of the stimulus plan that states ""not less than $400,000,000 shall be transferred to the CDC for an additional amount for the screening and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV."" The committee report justifies this spending by highlighting the high number of new STD infections in the United States and the preventable cost to the healthcare system.

The article concludes by noting that while the $335 million in the House bill includes prevention programs for STDs, it also includes prevention programs for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis, which are not always transmitted sexually. Therefore, the claim that the stimulus package includes $335 million specifically for STD prevention programs is accurate, but it is important to recognize that the funding is allocated for a broader range of prevention programs as well.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

33,9272,Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers,"The release does not mention the cost of the potential new drug, nor is there any estimate of what the cost might be in comparison to other asthma treatments currently in use including inhalers and corticosteroids. The release would have been more helpful to people with asthma if it had included some cost estimates since new medications tend to be very expensive. If it’s not too early to promote a treatment to a patient audience, it’s not too early to provide a ballpark cost. If this release would have only discussed the primary outcome goal of the study — “to examine the effects on inflammation in the airway by measuring the sputum eosinophil count” — then we’d probably give it a satisfactory rating on this category since it provided clear numerical data showing a significant reduction in percentages among patients taking the drug versus those on placebo. But the release didn’t stop there. It had the principle investigator add glowingly, “A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works.” If these additional measurements were so significant in the study, then why was that data excluded from the release? We need quantification of the actual results of the clinical tests to be able to judge benefits. It’s particularly important to note side effects associated with new medications but the release makes no mention of any harms arising from the drug’s use in the study. However, the full research paper (which unfortunately is behind a paywall) includes a table of adverse events experienced by both the experimental group and patients receiving a placebo that include problems such as infections, respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal and nervous system disorders. While these may ultimately have been minor problems, they deserve mentioning. This release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data (as far as the sputum eosinophil count data goes). As mentioned above, it falls short in providing other indicators which would have strengthened it considerably. But readers are given a clear idea of the degree of improvement the drug provides to patients in terms of the reduction of eosinophil in sputum, compared to those receiving only a placebo. The release verges on disease mongering given some of the exuberant language, particularly from the patient testimonial, but it stops short by noting how many asthma suffers there are in the UK. Asthma is a common and often-serious health problem so giving some context was beneficial. The release gets credit for including the funding sources of the study — Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the National Institute for Health Research in the UK, and the European Union — but it fails to point out any of the linkages among the study’s authors to pharmaceutical firms. According to the published study disclosures, these relationships include speaking fees, consultancies, grants and full-time employment with Novartis and other companies. This transparency is needed for readers to ascertain bias. The release makes no mention of alternative treatments for asthma. There is no comparison with current approaches such as inhalers and corticosteroids or any other approaches regarding this illness. There are a variety of established treatments that are used according to standard protocols depending on asthma severity. The release is fairly clear in pointing out that this was a clinical trial and that the drug, fevipiprant, isn’t available to the public as of yet. The release claims novelty with the statement, “The first new asthma pill for nearly 20 years has the power to significantly reduce the severity of the condition.” That’s not correct. In recent years, several new drugs known as leukotriene receptor antagonists have come on the market in the U.S. as tablets. The release gets credit for having a conservative headline — “Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers” — but then loses it when it allows the main researcher to proclaim, “This new drug could be a game changer for future treatment of asthma.” Then it follows that up with what basically is a testimonial from one of the participants in the study who says, “I felt like a completely different person” after taking the drug, adding, “For me, it felt like a complete wonder drug and I can’t wait for it to be available because I really think it could make a huge difference to me.” She closes by saying that after stopping taking the drug, her health started to “go downhill again very quickly.” Her comments may be factual and might fit well in marketing advertising but they have no place in a news release explaining new health research. Interestingly, the University had also issued a second release related to the same research but not linked in the original release, that offered commentary from two unaffiliated experts. One offered that “The data strongly support further studies,” while the other said, “More research is needed and we’re a long way off seeing a pill for asthma being made available over the pharmacy counter.” Both comments would have improved the value of the initial release, had they been included.",false,"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily. The latter of the two didn’t offer “anything beyond what is in the news release,” according to reviewers.","The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers.

34,8431,Austria plans to test all retirement home residents for coronavirus.,"The Alpine republic acted early in its outbreak to shut schools, bars, restaurants, non-essential shops and other gathering places roughly four weeks ago. It has told the public to stay at home and work from there if possible. So far it has reported just 410 deaths in total, fewer than some larger countries are suffering each day. Health Minister Rudolf Anschober told a news conference the daily increase in cases was now 0.9%, which he said was the lowest rate in Europe. “The very strong focus in the coming weeks will be the testing of all staff and all residents of retirement and care homes. We are talking, ladies and gentlemen, about 130,000 people,” Anschober said. That will take some time. Anschober has said the daily testing capacity in the country of 8.8 million people is more than 10,000 but less than the 15,000 that conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has set as a target. The health ministry said there is no date by which the country’s 918 retirement and care homes must be tested. “The international experience has been that this area is the area where the risk is greatest,” Anschober, who is from the left-wing Greens party, said. The elderly and those with underlying health problems are most at risk of dying of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Austria started loosening its lockdown on Tuesday, letting DIY stores, garden centres and smaller shops reopen. Larger shops and hairdressers are due to follow from May 1. It has said it will be on the lookout for any acceleration in infections and will delay its step-by-step loosening of its lockdown if necessary. It also has some lingering hotspots of infection under quarantine, including the ski resorts of Ischgl, St Anton am Arlberg and Soelden. Retirement homes have been a major source of coronavirus-related deaths in hard-hit countries like Italy, Spain and France, but there is no mention of the facilities in Austria’s data. It reports deaths where the patient previously tested positive for the virus, regardless of whether it caused death. Austria does, however, give a breakdown of COVID-19 deaths by age. Almost all of them were over 65.",true,"Austria, one of the more successful countries in Europe at flattening the curve of coronavirus infections, plans to test every retirement home resident as it expands efforts to measure the pandemic’s spread, its health minister said on Thursday.","Austria has announced plans to test all staff and residents of retirement and care homes for coronavirus. The country has been praised for its early and strict measures to combat the outbreak, which has resulted in a relatively low death toll of 410.

The testing of all staff and residents in retirement and care homes is a priority, as this is considered the area with the greatest risk. Austria has a daily testing capacity of over 10,000, but aims to reach 15,000 tests per day. The country has started to ease its lockdown measures, allowing DIY stores, garden centers, and smaller shops to reopen. Larger shops and hairdressers are scheduled to reopen on May 1. Austria will closely monitor the situation and delay further easing if necessary. The country still has some areas under quarantine, including popular ski resorts. While retirement homes have been a major source of coronavirus-related deaths in other countries, Austria's data does not mention these facilities.

35,8700,"Earthquake in Turkey-Iran border region kills nine, injures more than 100.","In Turkey, three of the dead were children, and 50 people were injured, including nine critically, the health ministry said. The shallow tremor caused more than 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, prompting a brief rescue effort to find those trapped under rubble. The quake damaged buildings some 90 km (56 miles) to the west in the Turkish city of Van, and to the east in dozens of villages in Iran, where state TV said 75 people were injured including six in hospital. There were several aftershocks including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude that stuck nearby 10 hours later. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from that quake, which was also fairly shallow and potentially dangerous. Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran and Turkey are among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. After the initial tremor, Turkish TV footage showed people digging with shovels and their hands in the rubble, as well as furniture and belongings strewn on cracked and snowy roads. In one village the ground cratered under several buildings, while in others residents were wrapped in blankets outside homes with crumbled and cracked exterior walls, fallen metal roofs and twisted wiring. “The damage caused loss of life,” the governor of Van, Mehmet Bilmez, told reporters standing in front of a pile of cinder blocks and sheet metal. “There is destruction in all four villages” he visited on Sunday morning, he added. The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said the quake, which hit at 8:53 a.m. (05:53 GMT), had a depth of 5 km (3.1 miles). The second big quake struck at 7:00 p.m. Broadcasters and government officials said dozens of villages were rattled in Turkey. Nearly 150 tents were sent to shelter families in the region, where several schools in the districts of Baskale, Saray and Gurpinar sustained minor damage. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) has begun rescue work in villages including in Ozpinar, about 25 km south of the epicenter, said Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. AFAD measured the initial tremor at 5.9 magnitude. The U.S. Geological Survey put the epicenter 47 km west of the Iranian city of Khoy, where people felt the effects, according to state TV. An earthquake last month in eastern Turkey killed more than 40 people while another in Iran did structural damage to homes without causing any fatalities. An Iranian official told state TV that rescue teams had been dispatched to the area in Iran’s West Azarbaijan province. Another local official said the earthquake was felt in several towns including Urmiah and Salmas, and many villages including some that suffered “100% damage”, state TV reported.",true,"Nine people were killed and buildings collapsed across southeastern Turkey on Sunday when a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck near the border with Iran, injuring more than a hundred in villages and towns in both countries, government officials said.","A powerful earthquake struck the Turkey-Iran border region, resulting in the deaths of nine people and injuring over 100 others.

36,5367,TravelLab: Adults take over science museums when night falls.,"“If you go to a natural history museum during the day, it’s definitely a space for people who are under 4 feet tall. And that’s clear in every way — from the soup they serve at the cafeteria to the height of the label,” said Victoria Cain, a museum historian at Northeastern University in Boston. “It’s kind of fun to reclaim that space for adults.” On a recent June evening, 175 grown-ups signed up for a slumber party at the New York museum, which has capitalized on the hype created by Ben Stiller’s “Night at the Museum” franchise. The museum’s first sleepovers were aimed at kids. Then in 2014, people 21 and up were invited to explore its darkened exhibit halls. The experiment was so popular that other science centers followed suit. Aquariums and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere have hosted pajama parties for grown-ups. And they’ve become a hot ticket, according to Cain. “When I saw that we could do it and that there was also alcohol, we were like, ‘Oh my gosh. Someone read our diary,’” said Janine Agarwal, 29, who attended the sleepover at the American Museum of Natural History to celebrate her husband’s birthday. THE EXPERIENCE During the night, guests have dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and can wander around the 45 permanent exhibition halls. They can also join guided tours, visit the planetarium, meet with curators and chat with museum scientists about their research — all while the city rests. “I don’t think there’s any way you’d be able to experience this place in such a special way as doing this kind of overnight,” said Giancarlo Bruni, of Toronto, as he played with the control panel of a full-size submarine. “It’s phenomenal.” While only adults are allowed, there is still childish fun to be had. Monica Seebohm and her friend Renee Brown came in hooded T. rex onesies. “We’re always looking for some adventure, and we thought bringing a dinosaur costume was appropriate,” Seebohm said. “We like to dress for the occasion.” Lights go out at 2 a.m. People can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum’s cots, aligned right below the belly of a 94-foot-long blue whale that hangs from the ceiling of the Hall of Ocean Life. Those who feel restless can get cookies and coffee at the Hall of Planet Earth. Michael Nedell, 53, recalled being afraid of the whale as a child. “When I was younger, that blue whale freaked me out. I’d been scared of (it) until I grew into a teenager,” he said. “Now I get to sleep under her.” THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT Silence greets those who venture into remote exhibits. That stillness makes a difference for visitors hoping to learn something, said biologist John Karavias. “During the day, you’re fighting crowds. You feel like you’re being rushed and all you’re doing is getting an ‘Ooh!’ and an ‘Ah!’ but you’re not learning,” said Karavias, who studies the effects of climate change on marine life. “When you go to these at night, all the background noise is quieted down and you’re able to digest the science behind everything that you’re looking at.” He was recently invited to show off acrylic bowls filled with weird-looking sea stars and sea urchins. Bright red spikes covered the body of one big star. Another one had arms so thin that they looked like noodles. Some visitors were awed; others recoiled when they touched the marine creatures. Starfish like these depend on a healthy ocean to survive, Karavias explained. But carbon dioxide from the burning of coal and natural gas is making the ocean more acidic. That means sea urchins, mussels, corals and other organisms have a hard time creating their shells or skeletons, which affects their development. A few floors above, tour guide Arlene Katz taught visitors about animals that glow. She approached a tank with an eel snuggled in the rocks. Its camouflaged body was hard to pick out from the sandy bottom. But an ultraviolet film made it glow greenish-blue. It’s not making its own light, like a firefly does. Instead, it absorbs light and releases it as a different color that’s invisible to predators but obvious to other eels. “It’s a hidden language,” she explained. “Sometimes you gotta hide and sometimes you gotta show off. They’re doing it simultaneously. It’s a brilliant solution.” Katz said the sleepover is an opportunity for guests to be surprised by nature. “We want people to have so much fun that they almost forget they’re learning,” she said. “But this is not an amusement park. We are sneaking in a lot of information.” If You Go... AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: Central Park West and 79th Street, New York. Adult sleepovers are offered several times a year.

They are adult humans, known to sometimes quietly contemplate science with a cocktail.","Science museums are hosting adult sleepovers, allowing grown-ups to explore the exhibits and learn about science in a unique and immersive way. The trend started at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which capitalized on the popularity of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. The sleepovers have become a hot ticket, with other science centers and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, and elsewhere following suit. 

During the sleepovers, guests have the opportunity to explore the museum's permanent exhibition halls, join guided tours, visit the planetarium, and meet with curators and museum scientists. The experience allows adults to experience the museum in a special way, without the crowds and rush of a typical visit during the day. 

The sleepovers also provide a chance for adults to have fun and embrace their inner child. Some attendees dress up in dinosaur costumes or onesies, adding to the playful atmosphere. The sleepovers typically include dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and guests can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum's cots, located below a 94-foot-long blue whale hanging from the ceiling. 

The sleepovers also have a scientific purpose. The quiet and stillness of the nighttime environment allows visitors to better absorb and learn from the exhibits. Biologist John Karavias explains that during the day, visitors often feel rushed and only get superficial reactions to the exhibits. At night, however, the background noise is quieted down, allowing visitors to digest the science behind what they are seeing. 

The sleepovers also provide an opportunity for museum staff to educate guests about important scientific topics. For example, visitors learn about the effects of climate change on marine life, such as the impact of ocean acidification on starfish and sea urchins. They also learn about animals that glow and the hidden language they use to communicate with each other. 

Overall, the sleepovers provide a unique and educational experience for adults, allowing them to have fun, learn about science, and experience the museum in a special way.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

37,2326,Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.,"Among 73 lower and middle income nations, just four - Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic and Jordan - have adequate resources in place, according to a review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization. “More than three-quarters face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies,” Frances Day-Stirk, president of the International Confederation of Midwives, told reporters on a conference call. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, experts said. That is critical to relieve pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths and 289,000 maternal deaths. More than 92 percent of those deaths occurred in the countries reviewed, the groups said in their “State of the World’s Midwifery” report. The countries included in the review range from China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan to Central African Republic, Chad, Guatemala and Mexico, among others. Many lack the infrastructure necessary to allow for quality care from midwives, and often don’t have regulatory systems in place to adequately train them, according to the report. Collecting necessary data is also a problem. “Women and girls’ right to maternal and reproductive health are essential,” Babatunde Osotimehin, a physician and executive director of the UN’s Populations Fund, told reporters. They “need and deserve respectful, compassionate care before, during and after pregnancy and birth ... This is not the case in many countries. This needs to change.” The crisis is also an economic one, experts said. For example, boosting midwifery services can reduce costly cesarean births, saving up to $128.5 million over three decades, Day-Stirk said. One country that has shown some gains is Bangladesh, where the government in 2010 launched an effort to train 3,000 midwives, helping reach key health goals even though birth-related mortality remains high, experts highlighted. The report, funded by the UN along with the U.S. and Canadian governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other groups, and Johnson & Johnson, is part of the UN and WHO’s larger effort to boost access to midwives by 2030.",true,"The majority of the world’s poorer countries, which account for nearly all childbirth-related deaths among newborns and mothers, are facing a critical shortage of professional midwives who could ease the problem, global health experts said on Tuesday.","A review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization has found that among 73 lower and middle-income nations, only four have adequate resources in place to provide necessary care for women and newborns.

The report was funded by the UN, the U.S. and Canadian governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Johnson & Johnson, and other groups.\nClaim: Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.\nThe claim veracity: true.\nUsing only the context provided, explain why the claim veracity is true.\n""}]","The review conducted by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization found that the majority of lower and middle-income countries lack adequate resources to provide necessary care for women and newborns. This includes a shortage of midwives, who play a crucial role in delivering babies and providing medical care before and after pregnancy. The report states that more than three-quarters of the countries reviewed face serious shortages, resulting in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. The lack of midwifery services is identified as a health crisis, with a significant impact on maternal and newborn mortality rates. The report emphasizes the importance of addressing this issue and calls for increased access to midwives in order to improve maternal and reproductive health outcomes."

39,7879,"UK to use firefighters to deliver food, collect bodies in coronavirus crisis.","Britain initially took a strikingly modest approach to the worst health crisis since the 1918 influenza epidemic but then changed tack to impose stringent controls after projections showed a quarter of a million British people could die. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a virtual lockdown of the world’s fifth largest economy to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus banning Britons from leaving their homes for all non-essential reasons. So far, 578 people in the United Kingdom have died after testing positive for coronavirus and the number of confirmed cases has risen to 11,658. The UK toll is the seventh worst in the world, after Italy, Spain, China, Iran, France and the United States, according to a Reuters tally. Under a deal struck between the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), Fire chiefs and Fire and Rescue Employers, firefighters will continue to respond to their usual emergencies but will now also carry out new tasks. “We face a public health crisis unparalleled in our lifetimes. The coronavirus outbreak is now a humanitarian emergency and firefighters rightly want help their communities,” said Matt Wrack, FBU general secretary. “Many fear the loss of life in this outbreak could be overwhelming and firefighters, who often handle terrible situations and incidents, are ready to step in to assist with body retrieval.” As well as collecting those who die should there be mass casualties, firefighters can drive ambulances, and take food and medicine to the vulnerable under the agreement. To cope with the outbreak, Britain has already asked tens of thousands of retired doctors and healthcare workers to return to work, while hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered to assist the state-run National Health Service. On Friday, the capital’s ambulance service appealed to former paramedics and control room staff for help, and London’s police force asked officers who have retired in the last five years to come back. “It is important that we take all reasonable steps to bolster our numbers,” London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said. Britons across the country took to their balconies and front doors on Thursday evening to applaud health workers and bang pots and pans to show support for those working for the nation’s much-loved NHS. There has been criticism that the government has not acted quickly enough to provide protective equipment to frontline healthcare staff and it is also scrambling to source thousands of ventilators to treat those with severe breathing problems caused by the virus. The government has admitted that it missed an opportunity to join a European Union procurement scheme to source the equipment because of an email mix up. “There was an issue in terms of communications so the tendering process on those schemes had already started,” Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC radio on Friday.",true,"The United Kingdom will use firefighters to help deliver food, retrieve dead bodies and drive ambulances as it braces for the looming peak of the coronavirus outbreak that has already claimed the lives of more than 22,000 people across the world.","The UK government has enlisted firefighters to assist in the response to the coronavirus crisis.

Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice.

The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink.

41,26376,Donald Trump Says Joe Biden has “written a letter of apology” for calling Trump’s travel restrictions from China “xenophobic.”,"President Donald Trump repeated the misleading claim that former Vice President Joe Biden called him xenophobic for banning travel from China in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Trump added a new wrinkle on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, claiming that Biden not only called the travel restrictions xenophobic, but also apologized for the remark ""with a letter on a Friday night."" ""Biden has now written a letter of apology because I did the right thing,"" Trump said during a May 3 virtual town hall with Fox News. ""He actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move,'"" Trump said later. ""It wasn’t well played by the press, but he said I made the right move."" There may be a simple reason why the letter Trump described didn’t get media coverage: There is no evidence such a letter exists. ""Never happened,"" said Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates. Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to our requests for comment in time for publication, and Trump wasn’t asked to substantiate his claim during the town hall. We found no public record of any Friday-night letter of apology — or any letter of apology — from Biden on Twitter, Google or the Nexis news archive database. Other political reporters and fact-checkers have reached the same conclusion. On Jan. 31, the Trump administration announced temporary restrictions on travel into the U.S. for immigrants and non-immigrants who had recently been ""physically present"" in China, with exceptions made for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and their family members. The move followed similar decisions from roughly 45 other countries and announcements from a number of airlines that they would be suspending flights between China and the U.S. while the outbreak ran its course. Trump has repeatedly touted the policy, crediting it with saving ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" during the Fox News town hall. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, declared Biden’s support for the China restrictions months later in a statement to CNN on April 3, a Friday. CNN posted its story in the afternoon. ""Joe Biden supports travel bans that are guided by medical experts, advocated by public health officials, and backed by a full strategy,"" Bedingfeld told CNN. ""Science supported this ban, therefore he did too."" But Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic, as Trump has claimed. At a campaign event on Jan. 31, the same day Trump announced the China travel restrictions, Biden cited Trump’s ""xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration’s policy. He said that in a time of ""crisis with the coronavirus,"" the ""credibility of a president is most needed."" ""This is no time for Donald Trump's record of hysteria xenophobia, hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science,"" he said. The following day, Biden tweeted, ""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering."" We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency. Biden used the word twice more in March. But one comment was in reference to Trump calling the coronavirus a ""foreign"" virus, and the second was not clearly in reference to the travel policy. Bates, Biden’s spokesman, told us in March that Biden ""has decried Trump's xenophobia for years, and was saying that it shouldn't influence the U.S. approach to this outbreak."" ""This was not in reference to coronavirus travel restrictions,"" he said. An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like the former vice president admitted to complimenting Trump for the China travel restrictions. But in its full context, the clip shows Biden was criticizing Trump for not acting with enough ""urgency."" Trump said Biden called the ban on travel coming in from China ""xenophobic,"" and that ""he actually apologized with a letter on a Friday night saying ‘he made the right move.’"" We found no record of any letter or apology from Biden.

An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like he complimented Trump for the travel restrictions. However, in the full context, Biden was actually criticizing Trump for not acting urgently enough.

In conclusion, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that Biden wrote a letter of apology for calling the travel restrictions xenophobic. Biden's campaign spokesman denied the existence of such a letter, and there is no public record of it. While Biden has used the word ""xenophobic"" to describe Trump, it was not directly in reference to the China travel policy.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

42,3386,New York tries to keep alive flavored e-cigarette ban.,"The state’s Public Health and Health Planning Council voted Thursday to keep the emergency ban on the books for another 90 days. The council had approved the ban in September, but a state appeals court blocked the state in October from enforcing it. The state also plans to seek public comment on banning menthol e-cigarette flavoring. In October, a state appeals court temporarily blocked New York from enforcing its prohibition on sales of flavored e-cigarettes after the vaping industry sued to block the ban. The rules were set to expire this month, but the council wants to renew the regulations for another 90 days. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said the vote to keep it alive would make sure New York has the emergency regulations on the books if the courts uphold the ban. “While our scheduled enforcement of this ban has been delayed by pending litigation, we are confident that the court will agree that this is a public health emergency demanding immediate action to help ensure the wellbeing of our children,” spokeswoman Jill Montag said. New York’s prohibition covering flavored e-cigarettes and other vaping products except for menthol and tobacco flavors went into effect immediately in September. Retailers initially had two weeks to remove merchandise from store shelves. Health officials issued the regulations in response to worries that vaping may cause illnesses and that its use is growing among teenagers. According to data from the state health department, use among high-school students increased from 10.5% in 2014 to 27.4% in 2018. Critics including the Vapor Technology Association sued the state over the ban, which they called governmental overreach that would hurt small businesses selling e-cigarettes and adult smokers who say flavors help them quit. The opponents have argued states should address improper marketing to kids and follow New York’s move to raise the statewide smoking age to 21. But supporters such as the American Cancer Society’s advocacy group said they’ll continue pushing for New York’s ban on flavored e-cigarettes and for laws to make similar restrictions permanent. The groups want New York to ban all flavored tobacco, and argue flavoring can attract kids to tobacco products and get them hooked. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo had said he would move to expand New York’s flavor ban to include menthol. Anti-tobacco and -vaping groups say there’s no scientific basis for leaving menthol alone. They warn that menthol has been unethically marketed toward African Americans, and that mint and menthol flavors can still increase the appeal of e-cigarettes for young people who aren’t smokers by overcoming the harshness of nicotine. New York City Council separately passed its own bill last month banning flavored vaping products including menthol. The bill has the support of Democratic Bill de Blasio and is expected to take effect in July 2020, barring legal challenges. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday over 2,400 confirmed and probable cases of lung illnesses and 52 deaths nationwide have been attributed to vaping.

44,35289,"Under U.S. President Donald Trump, federal authorities are confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","As the U.S. federal government and states clashed over how to respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020, workers on the frontlines of helping virus patients reported widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks and gowns. Hospital and state leaders described a chaotic and highly competitive market for securing supplies from vendors — disarray that critics of President Donald Trump blamed on his ad-hoc approach to addressing the shortfall. Meanwhile, several news reports surfaced, claiming federal officials seized PPE shipments from local agencies or stopped the deals between vendors and states by offering higher bids. Snopes received numerous inquiries from readers about the validity of the assertion. To get to the root of the claim, we first researched from where the news reports originated. From The New York Times to the Boston Globe to The Intelligencer (a blog within New York magazine), several media outlets highlighted the experience of Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Springfield, Massachusetts, who said the pandemic has forced him into PPE supply-chain work. On April 17, 2020, he published a letter in a peer-reviewed medical journal, The New England Journal of Medicine, about his apparent travails of getting a large shipment of face masks and respirators from a warehouse in a mid-Atlantic state. (He told The New York Times he would not publicize the location of the transaction out of fear of jeopardizing his relationship with the supply vendor.) The letter read: Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system’s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. It is unclear why federal officials may have targeted the Massachusetts delivery or where they would have allegedly redirected the supplies. Citing a policy of not confirming or denying specific investigations, the FBI declined to comment on Artenstein’s account in an April 20 New York Times story, saying only that the agency had been working to ensure that PPE “is not being unlawfully distributed or hoarded” during the coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, the Boston Globe could not reach the Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses FEMA, to comment on the doctor’s story. Though widely circulated online, Artenstein’s story was not the only report of federal interference in the procurement of PPE in spring 2020. On April 7, the Los Angeles Times reported health care officials in seven states said the federal government seized their shipments and did not give guidance on how or if the local agencies would someday get the supplies they ordered. “Are they stockpiling this stuff? Are they distributing it? We don’t know,” one unidentified official told the LA Times. “And are we going to ever get any of it back if we need supplies? It would be nice to know these things.” Additionally, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told The New York Times that FEMA stepped in at the last minute of a deal the city had with “one of its usual suppliers” to buy 1 million masks; a New Jersey county official told local media an order of 35,000 N95 and other masks were “commandeered” by the federal government; and a leader of the private health care company Kaiser Permanente told staff members that the company had found 20 million masks to purchase, “but the feds actually seized that shipment before we were able to acquire it,” the Times reported. The same news story said: In Massachusetts, state leaders said they had confirmed a vast order of personal protective equipment for their health workers; then the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, the head of a hospital system told members of Congress that his broker had pulled out of an agreement to deliver four shipments of desperately needed medical gear after the supplies were commandeered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado thought his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were “swept up by FEMA.” Adding to those reports are worries by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker that if he publicly discusses how he’s obtaining masks and gloves for his state, federal officials may catch wind and seize the materials, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “The supply chain has been likened to the wild West, and once you have purchased supplies, ensuring they get to the state is another herculean feat,” a spokesperson for the governor told the news outlet.",true,"What's true: Numerous health care officials and state leaders have reported instances in which federal authorities have intervened on local agencies' agreements with PPE vendors. In several cases, state officials reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) confiscated supplies within the last minute of deals with no explanation, while others reported the agency outbid them for the equipment. What's false: However, FEMA does not appear to have an organized effort for commandeering equipment at the local level. Agency representatives said they are working under a broad distribution plan to get supplies to areas in highest need.","The article discusses the claim that under President Donald Trump, federal authorities have been confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim is supported by various news reports and accounts from healthcare officials and leaders.

The article mentions Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Massachusetts, who published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine detailing his experience with federal interference in obtaining a large shipment of face masks and respirators. He stated that before he could send the funds for the shipment, two FBI agents arrived and questioned him. After assuring them that the PPE was intended for hospitals, the agents allowed the equipment to be released. However, the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting the supplies, but intervention from a congressional representative prevented their seizure.

The Los Angeles Times also reported that healthcare officials in seven states claimed that the federal government seized their PPE shipments without providing guidance on when or if they would receive the supplies they ordered. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that FEMA intervened in a deal the city had with a supplier to buy 1 million masks. A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government.

The article mentions additional reports of federal interference in PPE procurement. Massachusetts state leaders confirmed a large order of PPE for healthcare workers, but the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, a hospital system had an agreement to receive four shipments of medical gear, but FEMA commandeered the supplies. Colorado Governor Jared Polis believed his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were taken by FEMA. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker expressed concerns that discussing how his state obtained masks and gloves could lead to federal officials seizing the materials.

The article concludes by stating that the supply chain for PPE has been described as chaotic and competitive, with federal officials allegedly seizing shipments and disrupting deals between vendors and states. The FBI declined to comment on specific accounts of interference, but stated that they were working to prevent unlawful distribution or hoarding of PPE during the pandemic. The Department of Homeland Security did not provide a comment on the matter.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

47,30528,"Before his death, physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith after a visit with Pope Francis.","The renowned physicist Stephen Hawking died in March 2018 at the age of 76, prompting a wave of tributes from the world of science, as well as reflections on his inspirational life story. On 14 March 2018, the “Catholics Online” Facebook page posted a photograph of Hawking meeting Pope Francis alongside a fabricated claim: Before he died, Stiph [sic] Hawkins [sic] who did not believe in God requested to visit the Vatican. “Now l believe” was the only statement he made after the Holy Father blessed him. Hawking was a longstanding and prominent atheist who often wrote and spoke about the origins of the universe and his views on the notion of a divine Creator (or rather, a lack thereof). As the Washington Post documented after his death, Hawking told the Guardian in 2011 that he did not believe in an afterlife or heaven: I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. In 2010, he told ABC News: “One can’t prove that God doesn’t exist, but science makes God unnecessary.” There is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death, and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016, the last time the two men met. Contrary to the claim, Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff; rather, he travelled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Hawking was a valued member of the academy, having been appointed to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968. The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its aims “fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical and religious values.” After his death, the academy honored Hawking, tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis. il beato Paolo VI che si inginocchia per consegnare la medaglia di Pio XI e Hawking che ringrazia al Papa per la decorazione pic.twitter.com/zVICFDlkaE — Casina Pio IV (@CasinaPioIV) March 15, 2018 However, notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself. Hawking’s phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity. For example, after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens — an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion — American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer. The book was widely dismissed and fiercely criticized by friends of Hitchens. Before that, there were debunked eleventh-hour “conversions” to Christianity by Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, and astronomer Carl Sagan.",false,"This Facebook post is just another in a litany of fabricated claims about famous non-believers. The source is a Facebook page associated with the disreputable web site FrancisMary.org, which appears to have no formal affiliation with the Catholic church and routinely posts clickbait articles touting videos of Jesus Christ appearing in the flesh during a church service, or as an “angel on a white horse fighting in Israel.”","The claim that physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith before his death is false.

48,8351,"Coronavirus death toll jumps to 107 in Italy, all schools shut.","The total number of dead in Italy rose to 107 after 28 people died of the highly contagious virus over the past 24 hours, the Civil Protection Agency said. Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said schools and universities all over the country would be closed from Thursday until at least March 15. Only those in the northern regions most heavily affected by the epidemic have been closed so far. The number of cases since the outbreak surfaced 13 days ago rose to 3,089 from 2,502 on Tuesday. Of those who contracted the disease, about 3.5% had died, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said. The government adopted a decree to try to slow infections which have been rising by about 500 per day. “Our hospitals, despite their efficiency, risk being overwhelmed, we have a problem with intensive-care units,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. The decree orders “the suspension of events of any nature ... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.” It calls for the closure of cinemas and theatres and tells Italians not to shake hands or hug each other, and to avoid “direct physical contact with all people.” It also orders all major sporting events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, to be played in empty stadiums. The school closures caused jubilation among some children and mixed reactions from parents. “I hoped for this decree because I feared an outbreak at school,” said Massimiliano Del Ninno, father of a Rome primary school student. “Even if we are dealing with an age group that doesn’t seem to be at risk, they could have been carriers.” Clarissa Mazzei, a 30-year-old mother of three, called it “tragic ... for the students, and also for the parents.” Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said the government was aware of the problems it would cause families and was preparing a directive to allow a parent to stay home from work to look after children. The virus outbreak remains centred on the wealthy and populous region of Lombardy, around Milan, and the neighbouring regions of Veneto and Emilia Romagna, but cases are spreading around the whole of the Italian peninsula and Sicily. Rome’s Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital said it had 20 coronavirus patients, while others were being treated at home in and around Italy’s capital and largest city. Emilia Romagna’s regional government said on Wednesday two of its members had tested positive and Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli is in self-imposed isolation after coming into contact with a patient, though he himself had tested negative. The outbreak has already heavily disrupted life in the north, with cinemas and museums closed in some regions and many events cancelled including fashion shows and trade fairs. On Wednesday, the government instructed public sector managers to reorganise offices to help staff work from home. Italy’s chronically weak economic growth looks sure to suffer, with the tourist sector taking a huge hit from a wave of cancellations. Industry lobby Confindustria said the country was in recession, forecasting a fall in gross domestic product in both the first and second quarters of this year. Confturismo, the tourist industry’s confederation, said the sector was “on its knees.” It forecast a drop of some 32 million in the number of Italian and foreign tourists in March-to-May, with a loss to the industry of about 7.4 billion euros ($8.23 billion). Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has promised tax breaks and other measures for the affected sectors worth 3.6 billion euros. A government source told Reuters on Wednesday this may be raised to 4.5 billion, or 0.25% of GDP.",true,Italy closed all schools and universities and took other emergency measures on Wednesday to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Europe’s worst-hit country as the death toll and number of cases jumped.,"The total number of deaths in Italy due to the coronavirus has risen to 107, with 28 deaths occurring in the past 24 hours.

49,1382,Regulator grants license for Britain's first three-parent IVF babies.,"The license, granted to a team of doctors in Newcastle, northern England, means the first child created in Britain using the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique could be born before the end of this year. Critics of the treatment say it is a dangerous step that will lead to the creation of genetically modified “designer babies”. But the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre said they were delighted with the decision “to help families affected by these devastating diseases”. “Many years of research have led to the development of pronuclear transfer as a treatment to reduce the risk of mothers transmitting disease to their children,” said Mary Herbert, a professor of Reproductive Biology at the Centre. “It’s a great testament to the regulatory system here in the UK that research innovation can be applied in treatment.” The technique involves intervening in the fertilization process to remove mitochondria, which act as tiny energy-generating batteries inside cells, and which - if faulty - can cause fatal heart problems, liver failure, brain disorders, blindness and muscular dystrophy. The treatment is known as “three-parent” IVF because the babies, born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor. It is designed to help families with mitochondrial diseases - incurable conditions passed down the maternal line that affect around one in 6,500 children worldwide. Britain’s parliament voted last year to change the law to allow the treatments if and when they were ready for licensing. But the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), still had to approve each clinic and each patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be carried out. Fertility specialists welcomed Thursday’s decision. Simon Fishel, managing director of CARE Fertility, said it was “excellent news” and “a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome”. Allan Pacey, a fertility expert at Sheffield University, said it was “a great day for science”. While Britain has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debate about pro-nuclear transfer techniques, it will not be the first country in the world to have children born using 3-parent IVF treatment. The world’s first and so-far only known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 after U.S. doctors working at a clinic in Mexico helped a Jordanian couple conceive using the treatment. (The story was refiled to say Allan Pacey is a professor at Sheffield University in paragraph 12)",true,- Britain’s fertility regulator on Thursday granted doctors the first UK license to create babies using a three-parent IVF technique designed to prevent inherited genetic diseases.,"The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK has granted a license to a team of doctors in Newcastle to carry out the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique, which could result in the birth of the first child created in Britain using this method by the end of the year.

This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor. The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues. The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases. The UK has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debates regarding pro-nuclear transfer techniques.

Critics of the treatment argue that it is a dangerous step that could lead to the creation of genetically modified ""designer babies."" Nevertheless, fertility specialists have praised the decision, with one calling it a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome. The license was granted following a change in the law last year that allowed the treatment to be carried out once it was ready for licensing. The HFEA will still need to approve each clinic and patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be performed. Overall, the decision to grant the license for three-parent IVF babies in the UK has been met with both praise and criticism, highlighting the ongoing ethical debate surrounding this technique.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The technique involves removing faulty mitochondria, which can cause serious health problems, from embryos and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a female donor. This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor. The treatment is intended to help families affected by mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited conditions that can cause various health issues. The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases. The UK has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debates regarding pro-nuclear transfer techniques. However, it is not the first country to have children born using three-parent IVF treatment, as the world\'s first known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 with the help of US doctors at a clinic in Mexico. Critics of the treatment argue that it is a dangerous step that could lead to the creation of genetically modified ""designer babies."" Nevertheless, fertility specialists have praised the decision, with one calling it a milestone that all who care about medical health will welcome. The license was granted following a change in the law last year that allowed the treatment to be carried out once it was ready for licensing. The HFEA will still need to approve each clinic and patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be performed.

50,3073,"Jordan, Egypt faulted for deaths of US-trained sniffer dogs.","The State Department Office of Inspector General recommended that two U.S. agencies stop sending the specially trained dogs to the two countries until they have plans in place to make sure they are taken care of and monitored to ensure their well-being. The two agencies, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Counter-terrorism, agreed to the recommendation and said earlier this month they had taken actions to protect the dogs, according to the OIG. The agencies had resisted halting the program when an initial report on the subject was released in September. The State Department has sent more than 200 dogs to various countries overseas to help prevent terrorism over the past 20 years. The September OIG report raised concerns about Jordan and found “ongoing health and welfare concerns among dogs deployed to Jordan,” which is the largest recipient of the dogs in the explosive-detection program. The report released Friday was an update issued after investigators learned of continuing problems and additional deaths. It found several dogs died or had to be euthanized over the past 18 months, including at least two from heat stroke, one from a preventable parasite and a fourth from a pesticide sprayed in or near its kennel. The report said Jordan has agreed to stop using that pesticide around the kennels. A veterinarian consulted by the OIG said the heat stroke deaths were a result of “negligence and improper care,” and not accidents. In Egypt, the report said at least three dogs died, including one from heat stroke, and that officials there refused to allow State Department personnel to visit the kennels or the airport where the dogs work.

The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.\n\nThe dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.\n\nThe article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles.

51,10402,Medtronic insulin pump beats injections in study,"The story does not mention that the devices cost thousands of dollars and their use requires ongoing purchases of supplies and services. These costs may or may not be covered by health care insurance. As mentioned above, the story implies that the degree of improvement in the control of blood sugar levels reported by the researchers will reduce the risk of eye, kidney and heart disease, even though these health outcomes were not measured. Although control of blood sugar levels is a widely accepted target of diabetes treatment, the trial did not measure whether or not there were any noticeable improvements in real health outcomes. The story does not mention any potential harms of insulin pumps, even though the researchers reported that two patients were hospitalized because of infections at the site of the pump insertion. The story fails to report any of the limitations or qualifications reported by the researchers in their article in New England Journal of Medicine. These include: – the trial included only people who were able to adequately control their blood sugar levels and the results may not necessarily apply to people who are able to manage their diabetes by other methods; – the researchers were not blinded, that is, they knew whether patients were using the study devices or multiple daily insulin injections; – that the motivation of participants and support by health care providers in a clinical trial may not be replicated in regular clinical practice. And as mentioned above, the story implies that the improved control of one measure of blood sugar control (A1C) would lead to reductions in eye, kidney and heart disease, even though this trial did not measure those outcomes. Although diabetes and complications from the disease are serious and common, the story fails to note that this trial reported only changes in one measure of blood glucose control, not hard health outcomes. While the story says that, “Lowering A1C levels helps reduce the risk of long-term complications from diabetes such as eye, kidney and heart disease,” it fails to point out that this study did not measure whether participants who used the pump and senor devices had lower rates of these diseases. Not only does this story lack an independent source, it makes no mention of the ties between the researchers and manufacturers of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors. Indeed, the disclosure summary included in the New England Journal of Medicine is 30 percent longer than the news report about the study. The story does note that the trial was sponsored by Medtronic, which manufactures the pump used by researchers. (Disclosures are summarized at the end of the article posted online at: statements provided by each auther are available at: Although the story does mention that people with diabetes can manage blood glucose levels with multiple daily injections of insulin, without a pump, it leaves out a critical piece of information. Patients who could successfully manage their blood sugar levels without a pump were excluded from the study. Readers should be told how often people with diabetes can achieve treatment targets without using a pump. This story does not make clear that the trial results apply only to people who are unable to achieve treatment goals by using multiple daily insulin injections. The story points out that these results are from a post-market study, thus indicating the device is already available. However, an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine accompanying the research article made an important point that was not included in the study: devices are not enough, effective glucose management requires effective management… and the “expert training and guidance received by patients in clinical trials cannot be readily duplicated in a busy clinical practice.” In other words, the results of this trial may not necessarily be achieved in general clinical practice because while the devices tested are widely available, expert support services are not.

It makes no mention of the financial ties between the researchers and insulin pump manufacturers, even though the researchers’ published conflict of interest disclosure summary was substantially longer than the news story itself. This thumbnail sketch of medical device trial results that may suit the needs of investors trying to predict stock performance fails to meet the needs of people who need relevant information about ways to manage diabetes. But does it really even give investors the true nitty-gritty they need?","The article discusses a study conducted by Medtronic that compared the use of insulin pumps to multiple daily injections for managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. The study found that the use of insulin pumps resulted in better control of blood sugar levels, as measured by the A1C test.

But a surprising claim was made in a fake news article published by the “fauxtire” web site Huzlers: the world suicide rate dropped 37 percent as a result: Days After Youtube star Logan Paul uploaded a video of him and friends laughing at a japanese suicide victim’s corpse, It is being reported that worldwide suicides have actually dropped by 37% since the video was uploaded a few days ago. This, of course, is not a genuine statistic. Huzlers is a fake news web site that does not publish factual stories. A disclaimer at the bottom of the web site states that “Huzlers.com is the most infamous fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world.” In addition to the dubious origins of this rumor, the world suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, so there would be no way to know if Paul’s “suicide forest” video, which was first uploaded on 31 December 2017, had any impact on the suicide rate over the course of a few days. Paul has since apologized for the video, which upset many of Paul’s notoriously obsessive fans and inspired criticism from mental health advocates. Suicide is a serious problem in Japan, home to the so-called suicide forest that Paul visited, with more than 20,000 such deaths recorded there annually. The rate has been in decline there in recent years, as Japanese officials have undertaken prevention efforts. The most recent data from the World Health Organization comes from 2015. According to WHO, the suicide rate was 10.7 per 100,000 people in 2015:",false,There were an estimated 788 000 suicide deaths worldwide in 2015. This indicates an annual global age-standardized suicide rate of 10.7 per 100 000 population.,"The claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is not true. The claim originated from a fake news website called Huzlers, which is known for publishing satirical and fictional stories. The website itself states that it is a fake news and satire entertainment website. Therefore, the claim is not based on factual information.

Furthermore, the world suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, so it would be impossible to determine if Paul's video had any impact on the suicide rate within a few days. The video was uploaded on December 31, 2017, and the suicide rate does not change so quickly.

Logan Paul's video titled ""We Found A Dead Body in Japan's Suicide Forest"" received widespread condemnation. The video featured footage of a man who had recently taken his own life. Paul faced backlash from the public, his fans, and mental health advocates. He later apologized for the video.

Suicide is a serious issue in Japan, particularly in the so-called suicide forest that Paul visited. Japan records over 20,000 suicide deaths annually. However, the suicide rate in Japan has been declining in recent years due to prevention efforts by Japanese officials.

The most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the suicide rate is from 2015. According to WHO, the suicide rate in 2015 was 10.7 per 100,000 people. It is important to note that this data is not related to Logan Paul's video and does not support the claim that the suicide rate dropped following the video's release.

In conclusion, the claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is false. The claim originated from a fake news website, and the suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis. The video received criticism, but its impact on the suicide rate cannot be determined.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

53,35522,"Thirty-three Florida labs were busted for ""cooking the books"" or tampering with data after not reporting negative COVID-19 test results between March and July 2020.","In July 2020, social media posts and news reports claimed that Florida labs were intentionally tampering with data by failing to report negative COVID-19 test results, making the coronavirus pandemic appear much worse in the southern state. The claims followed an investigation conducted by Orlando affiliate station Fox 35, which analyzed COVID-19 testing and case data collected between March 16, 2020, when testing began, and July 13, 2020, by the Florida Department of Health (DOH). Of the hundreds of labs analyzed, many were shown to have reported very high positivity rates for COVID-19. The accusations of tampering came as many health officials and local leaders came under criticism for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic and testing responses. Snopes dug through the 49-page report line-by-line and found that at least 45 laboratories that tested for COVID-19 did not report negative test results between March and July 2020 and instead showed 100% positivity, while dozens of others reported 90% positivity and higher. More than 300 labs did report negative test results, clocking percentage rates much lower than 100%. The table below shows labs that tested 40 or more people and reported 100% positivity, and failed to report negative test results: Public and private testing facilities are required to report their results to the DOH, which then releases a daily report covering surveillance data for every county in the state. DOH confirmed to Snopes that a number of testing labs did not report negative test results and issued the following statement in an email sent July 15, 2020: All COVID-19 cases are confirmed through diagnostic and antigen testing and then reported to the state by the labs performing the testing. Private and public laboratories are required to report positive and negative test results to the state immediately. In recent days, the Florida Department of Health noticed that some smaller, private labs weren’t reporting negative test result data to the state. The Department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive and transparent data. As the state continues to receive results from various labs, the Department will continue educating these labs on proper protocol for reporting COVID-19 test results. The department did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this lack of reporting could have skewed data on total case counts. It is not yet determined why these smaller labs did not report negative cases, and the department did not answer approximately how many negative test results were unreported. We will provide an update once these questions are answered. Labs Snopes spoke to claimed there were discrepancies and changes in DOH’s data reporting requirements. In an email sent to Snopes, Pancare of Florida President R. Michael Hill said that the DOH “misdirected their data collection process as an inaccuracy on PanCare’s part.” The testing lab said that it uses three methods for testing including one that detects viral antigens, which the DOH reportedly said it would not include “into the county or state numbers.” On July 1, DOH implemented an update to its electronic reporting process to “report all patient-specific results” daily and began integrating previously reported data from PanCare as of July 16. Lab24 in Miami confirmed this statement when it told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that it had tested around 10,000 people in Florida but that the state required that private labs only notify health officials of positive results. Snopes contacted Lab24 but did not receive a response at the time of publication. “In short, yes the COVID-19 data for the State of Florida is skewed, PanCare has conducted over 6,900 antibody tests, and over 16,000 antigen tests that have not been accurately reported by the Florida Department of Health because they refused to accept the results of both of these FDA-EUA approved tests at the time they were administered,” wrote Hill. Lee Memorial Hospital Lab told Snopes that it had accurately reported both negative and positive test results but that a hospital can have more than one entry in the DOH database. For example, results from Lee Memorial Hospital and Lee Memorial Hospital Lab come from the same testing facility yet each reported different rates. Lee Memorial Hospital reported an 18% positivity rate of 2,925 tests conducted while Lee Memorial Hospital Lab reported 100% positivity of 405 COVID-19 tests conducted. When combined, the overall positive results from the two hospitals were between 15 and 25%.",false,"What's true: At least 45 COVID-19 testing laboratories in Florida failed to report negative test results between March and July 2020, thus inaccurate positive testing rates were recorded for those facilities. However, more than 300 Florida labs did report negative results in that time frame. What's undetermined: Although health officials said that all laboratories are required to report both positive and negative test results, testing facilities that Snopes spoke with said that among other discrepancies in reporting requirements, the Florida Department of Health did not previously require negative test results to be reported. Snopes did not find evidence that the omission of negative results data in a minority of Florida labs' reporting was intentional or nefarious.","According to an investigation conducted by Orlando affiliate station Fox 35, many labs in Florida failed to report negative COVID-19 test results between March and July 2020, leading to accusations of tampering with data.

It would have been helpful to specify the estimated cost of existing implantable defibrillators. This story outlines the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices that have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. It explains that by using wires placed under the skin, instead of through blood vessels into the heart, the new device might reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The story cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently are given implantable defibrillators might be candidates for the new type of device. Although the researchers pointed out in their journal article that “the initial experience includes several cases of problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing,” the story does not refer to any potential harms. In the lead, this story appropriately characterizes the new report as a step toward implantable defibrillators that do not have wires attached directly to the hearts of patients. It points out that much of the new data is based on the experiences of about 60 patients who had one of the new devices for a year. The story makes more than one reference to the need for further trials before the developers of the new device would have enough evidence to apply for FDA approval. The story points out that the new device is intended for use in a subset of patients who are already considered candidates for conventional implantable defibrillators. The story includes an independent source. It points out that the trials of the new device were paid for by the manufacturer and that the lead researcher founded the company. The story makes clear that, depending on the results of further trials, the new device could be an incremental improvement on existing implantable defibrillators for certain patients. It also notes that it does not offer the heart pacemaker function of some existing implantable defibrillators. The story points out that the new type of implantable defibrillator is available in some countries in Europe, but that further trials are needed to produce evidence that could be used to apply for FDA approval in the United States. The story notes that the device has been under development for several years and requires further research before it can be considered for clinical use. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.",true,"This story includes an independent source and details about the underlying concept of the new device and its limitations that help readers put the research into the proper perspective. Aside from including more pertinent information, this story did a better job of characterizing the research report as one step in a long process. Until two treatments are directly compared, it is usually inappropriate to claim that one is superior to the other. This story does a good job of explaining the results of research into this new device without implying that the preliminary trials produced evidence it may be better than existing devices.","A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients.

The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device.

The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators.

The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing. It also emphasizes the need for further trials before there is enough evidence to apply for FDA approval.

The trials of the new device were funded by the manufacturer, and the lead researcher is the founder of the company. The report includes an independent source, which adds credibility to the information presented.

It is important to note that the new device does not offer the heart pacemaker function that some existing implantable defibrillators have. The report suggests that the new device could be an incremental improvement on existing devices for certain patients, depending on the results of further trials.

In conclusion, the report highlights the progress made towards developing implantable defibrillators that do not require wires attached directly to the heart. It emphasizes the need for further research and trials before the device can be considered for clinical use and FDA approval in the United States.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America.

57,17766,"In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.","On the first day of Florida’s new texting-while-driving ban, state Sen. Maria Sachs, the Senate Democratic leader pro-tem, was already announcing a proposal to make the law tougher. The new law makes texting while driving a secondary offense, which means an officer can’t ticket a motorist only for typing or reading messages while behind the wheel. Rather, the driver has to first commit another violation, like swerving or running a red light. Sachs, of Delray Beach, has filed a bill to make texting while driving a primary offense, which she argues will make it easier to enforce. The penalties -- $30 for a first violation -- will remain. At a press conference with AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson to announce her proposed changes, Sachs recited several somber statistics. We decided to fact-check this claim: ""In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" There’s little doubt that texting is a danger in automobile safety. A 2006 study by David Strayer and Frank Drews at the University of Utah found that people are just as impaired when they drive and talk on a cell phone as they are when they drive intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08 percent. The report, which looked at talking on handheld or hands-free cell phones and not texting, concluded that using a cell phone while driving ""can be as profound as those associated with driving while drunk."" But is it true that in 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths? When we contacted Sachs’ office, her legislative chief of staff said the information came from an op-ed piece AutoNation’s Mike Jackson wrote for the Tampa Bay Times and from news articles about a study done by the Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Long Island, N.Y. The statistic quoted by Sachs has appeared in various media outlets, including CBS and Newsday, but the study’s chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, said the media ""wrongly attributed"" the drinking-texting conclusions to his team’s studies, a bit of misinformation that has continued to spread. Adesman said his research team analyzed CDC data -- the 2011 ""Youth Risk Behavior Survey"" The study found that 45 percent of U.S. high school students 16 and up (46 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls) reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. The study suggested that the number could actually be a lot higher, given that 75 percent of teens now have cell phones. The study, however, didn’t directly compare texting and drinking while driving, which makes Sachs’ conclusion questionable. The study found a ""subgroup"" of the students who admit to texting while driving also tended to be involved in other risky behaviors on the road, including not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol and drinking and driving. These risk takers were also more likely to smoke marijuana, have unsafe sex and ""use indoor tanning devices."" The correlation of all these factors makes it difficult to determine what is the ""leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" Indeed, certain aspects of the study didn’t provide much support for proponents of texting laws. Researchers found that while texting while driving was slightly less common in states that prohibit it, ""the reality is that millions of teens text while driving,"" Adesman said. The study didn’t consider the strength of the laws or penalties. Adesman did say there’s reason to be alarmed about the number of teens texting. ""Kids aren’t drinking on a regular basis on school days, but they are texting daily."" (The CDC reports that high school teens drive after drinking 2.4 times a month.) Sachs said she wants to ""change the culture"" of texting while driving. ""I think our culture has turned against alcohol and driving, so we want to say to kids, ‘you know it’s wrong to drink and drive’ and the same thing has to be said about texting."" Another problem for Sachs’ claim: The data isn’t perfect. The involvement of cell phones is still underreported in accidents, said Deb Trombley, senior program manager for transportation initiatives for the National Safety Council. ""One challenge is that there isn’t good data. Cell phone use isn’t being recorded on crash reports… It goes down as distracted driving."" Jackson’s office said that he discovered the information about texting surpassing drunk driving as a cause of teen driving deaths from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, but staff didn’t have any further details. NHTSA officials said the data they collect suggested the opposite of what Jackson and Sachs claimed. According to the agency, 12 percent of 2,105 teen-aged drivers ages 14 to 18 involved in fatal crashes in 2011 were distracted in some way; 24 percent of those distracted drivers were using a cell phone. By comparison, 20 percent (428) of 14 to 18-year-old drivers involved in a fatal crash in 2011 had some level of alcohol in their system, according to NHTSA. A driving distraction can be anything from adjusting the radio or putting on makeup to eating a burger behind the wheel. With teens, there are often a bunch of noisy friends in the car. Our ruling Sachs’ statistic -- that starting in 2011, texting began surpassing alcohol as the leading contributing factor to teen driving deaths -- was based on a misinterpretation of a scientific study and information from NHTSA that could not be confirmed. In reality, NHTSA’s analysis of their data found that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. While there’s no question that texting while driving is a danger, it hasn’t supplanted alcohol as ""the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.""

While there’s no question that texting while driving is a danger, it hasn’t supplanted alcohol as ""the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths."" However, the figures are imperfect enough that we can't rule out an undercount in deaths associated with texting while driving.","The claim that ""In 2011, texting surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths"" is not supported by accurate data. State Sen. Maria Sachs made this claim while proposing to make texting while driving a primary offense in Florida. The claim was based on an op-ed piece written by AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson and a study done by the Cohen Children's Medical Center in Long Island, NY. However, the study's chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, stated that the media wrongly attributed the drinking-texting conclusions to his team's studies.

The study analyzed CDC data and found that 45% of U.S. high school students reported texting while driving during the previous 30 days. However, the study did not directly compare texting and drinking while driving, making Sachs' conclusion questionable. The study also found that students who admitted to texting while driving were more likely to engage in other risky behaviors on the road, such as not wearing a seatbelt, riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and drinking and driving. This correlation makes it difficult to determine the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.

The involvement of cell phones in accidents is underreported, making it challenging to gather accurate data. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data contradicted Sachs' claim, stating that alcohol was involved in more lethal crashes than distracted driving in 2011. NHTSA reported that 12% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes were distracted, with 24% of those distracted drivers using a cell phone. In comparison, 20% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes had alcohol in their system.

While texting while driving is undoubtedly dangerous, it has not surpassed alcohol as the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths. The data is imperfect, and there may be an undercount in deaths associated with texting while driving.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

58,4634,Indiana veteran who wanted final flight dies after reunion.,"Ken Dierdorf died this week, just days after his debilitating illness prevented him from flying in a military helicopter with the men who fought alongside him, the Tribune-Star reported . He was 68. Dierdorf’s health had been in steady decline since 2010 when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease, which attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body. The illness, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, led Dierdorf to eventually require a full-time respirator to aid his breathing. The Dierdorfs reached out to the Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice of the Wabash Valley earlier this year to see if they could get a Bell UH-1 Iroquois “Huey” ride for the Dirty Half Dozen, a group of Vietnam War veterans comprised of Dierdorf and his friends. VNA Hospice Care arranged a flight with the Army Aviation Heritage Foundation’s Huey at the air show. Even though Dierdorf couldn’t ride in the Huey last weekend, reuniting with his fellow military friends and watching them experience the flight fulfilled his last wish, said Kim Dierdorf, Ken’s wife. “He talked about it nonstop since Saturday,” she said. “And even though I know it took a lot out of him, I think because it was his last hurrah that he really, really wanted to do, I think that once that was able to happen for him he knew he didn’t have to fight any longer.” Ken Dierdorf getting his last wish fulfilled is fitting for someone so kind and full of life, said Gil Edgington, one of the Dirty Half Dozen friends. “It was all in God’s plan,” said Edgington, 69. “It meant so much to us, in his passing, that while it’s a shock we know that he’s not suffering anymore.” ___ Information from: Tribune-Star,",true,"A Vietnam War veteran from western Indiana had his last wish fulfilled by his reunited Army comrades, who flew in the Terre Haute Air Show.","Ken Dierdorf, a Vietnam War veteran, passed away at the age of 68 after a long battle with Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

59,7685,China expands switch from polluting coal heating in 2018: environment minister.,"China’s winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal a year, and switching it to cleaner types of fuel was identified as a major part of the country’s war on pollution, now in its sixth year. The program to convert households to low-emission heating ran into difficulties last winter amid widespread natural gas shortages, but 4.8 million households still managed to make the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity last year, up from 4 million households switched in 2017, Li said. China has also installed ultra-low emissions technology at more than 80 percent of its total coal-fired power generation capacity, Li added. But, speaking to journalists at a press conference on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary meeting, Li warned that despite the strides made in 2018, China’s war on smog was getting harder. “In reality the pressures are huge and it isn’t easy to be optimistic about the trends,” he said. “The things that could easily be done have already mostly been done, and the things that need to be done afterwards are much harder.” While China cut the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent last year, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, it remained too high, he said. There were also still regional disparities in the way environmental protection was being enforced, he said. China said last week that it would implement special emissions restrictions for a third consecutive winter, after Premier Li Keqiang told parliament that the state would continue to strengthen pollution controls in 2019. China’s economy expanded at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry has been at pains to state that it would not relent in its efforts to curb pollution. However, though concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 fell overall last year, they rebounded over winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities up 13 percent over the October-February period.",true,"China expanded its coal-to-gas and coal-to-electricity projects to 35 cities in 2018 from 12 cities the previous year, China’s environment minister, Li Ganjie, said on Monday, as the world’s second-largest economy stepped up its fight against smog.","China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie. Last year, 4.8 million households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity, up from 4 million households in 2017. China's winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal annually, and converting to low-emission heating was seen as a key part of the country's fight against pollution. Additionally, China has implemented ultra-low emissions technology in over 80 percent of its coal-fired power generation capacity. 

However, Li Ganjie warned that despite the progress made in 2018, China's battle against smog is becoming more challenging. He stated that the easy tasks have already been completed, and the remaining tasks are more difficult. While China reduced the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent in 2018, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, Li Ganjie believes it is still too high. He also mentioned regional disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection measures.

China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry is determined to continue its efforts to curb pollution. However, concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 increased over the winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities rising by 13 percent from October to February.

In response to these challenges, China announced that it would implement special emissions restrictions for the third consecutive winter. Premier Li Keqiang also stated that the government would continue to strengthen pollution controls in 2019. Despite the difficulties, China remains committed to reducing pollution and improving air quality.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

61,2703,Consumer goods CEOs in Davos hot seat over plastic waste.,"At the annual World Economic Forum this week, the bosses of these and other firms like Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) and PepsiCo (PEP.O) have been on the defensive, in a way reminiscent of how coal and oil chiefs came under pressure over climate change in previous years. “I see parallels to coal,” Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan told Reuters after she and Procter & Gamble boss David Taylor had a feisty exchange at a joint news conference at the forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. “It’s clear they are trying to not be regulated,” she added. The CEOs at Davos have vowed to cut their use of plastic packaging through a range of initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme unveiled during the forum. But Greenpeace used that announcement to call for plastic packaging bans and a goal of “peak plastic”, saying recycling was not enough. About 8 million tonnes of plastic are dumped into oceans every year, killing marine life and entering the food chain, according to the U.N. Environment Program. Data like that, and TV shows such as documentary-maker David Attenborough’s Blue Planet, have taken the issue to the top of the summit agenda. Attenborough, 92, was honoured with a special award at the start of the annual event, where environmental concerns were a running theme alongside gloom and doom over the U.S.-China trade war and a slowdown in the global economy. “I sometimes wonder if we’re in the branded litter business, branded trash,” Unilever Chief Executive Alan Jope half-joked after he was asked during a panel debate if consumers were interested in the source of the company’s products. In 2017 at Davos, Dove soap maker Unilever promised to ensure all of its plastic packaging was recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. “Two years ago at Davos, Unilever was in front on plastics. At the moment it’s very high on our radar to do something about plastic waste above and beyond...the rest of the industry.” Dozens of big companies have made various pledges to reduce plastic packaging, including a plan by 40 firms to eliminate unnecessary single-use plastic packaging in Britain by 2025. “We will roll out new tech next year that will reduce the amount of packaging per kilo,” PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta said at Davos, adding that Pepsi was trying to move more toward reusable cans and glass. PepsiCo, Unilever and European supermarket chains Carrefour (CARR.PA) and Tesco (TSCO.L) are among firms that signed up to the pilot waste-reduction programme unveiled in Davos this week. It will deliver products such as orange juice in reusable bottles to shoppers and pick up the empties for cleaning and re-use. “We can learn about the business model, and the consumer reaction to this and find solutions that last,” P&G’s Taylor said at the announcement. At one Davos panel debate, human rights lawyer Vivek Maru, founder of legal advocacy group Namati, asked PepsiCo’s Laguarta and the head of The Dow Chemical Company, Jim Fitterling, if they could be hit with lawsuits for the damage their companies had done, similar to litigation against the tobacco industry. “It’s a difficult question to answer,” Fitterling said. “The plastic waste got there through consumer behavior and people putting it out into the environment.” The plastic debate has also caught the eye of the insurance industry, which has taken stands at times on environmental issues. Some major insurers refuse to provide cover for new coal-fired power stations due to climate-change concerns, for example. “It’s not a big reinsurance topic at this stage,” Christian Mumenthaler, who runs the world’s second-largest reinsurer Swiss Re (SRENH.S), told Reuters at Davos. “The mechanism where insurance would be involved would be on the liability policies of these companies. If the risk becomes very big and they get sued — not specifically plastic but any company — for their behavior, this would flow into our risk assessment and they could start to have trouble getting insurance,” he added. “It’s heating up very quickly and we are already seeing some action from companies, so let’s see. I would hope they would act quickly enough, radically enough to be a good case of change.” Unilever and PespiCo chief executives bristled at Greenpeace’s call at Davos for more bans on plastic packaging, saying that the problem called for multiple solutions, from recycling and re-use to new packaging technologies. Last month, the European Union passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items such as straws and polystyrene cups by 2021. Greenpeace welcomed the move but called at the time for an EU-wide target to reduce consumption of food containers and cups. Greenpeace’s Morgan said the issue could not be solved through industry initiatives alone. “Many of the businesses behind these initiatives and others are expanding production of single-use plastic and are looking to grow in markets that can’t take more plastic,” Morgan said. “There’s a real risk that products like this become a distracting side show to generate positive (public relations).” Brune Poirson, secretary of state for ecology, sustainable development and energy in France, also took a swipe at the companies, saying they should take the initiative. “Because you’re not doing that, we have to intervene,” Poirson said. “I think it’s a waste of time, a waste of resources and it’s not being a real responsible organization.”",true,"Consumer products companies including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) are emerging as new targets for global activism, with green groups blaming them for fouling the ocean with plastic and activists urging governments to regulate them.","At the World Economic Forum in Davos, CEOs of consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and PepsiCo have faced criticism and pressure over their handling of plastic waste, similar to how coal and oil chiefs were scrutinized over climate change in previous years. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan compared the situation to the coal industry, stating that these companies are trying to avoid regulation. The CEOs at Davos have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging through various initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme. However, Greenpeace argues that recycling is not enough and calls for plastic packaging bans and a goal of ""peak plastic."" The issue of plastic waste has gained prominence due to alarming statistics, such as 8 million tonnes of plastic being dumped into the oceans each year, causing harm to marine life and entering the food chain. The CEOs of Unilever and PepsiCo have acknowledged the urgency of the issue and have made commitments to reduce plastic packaging. Unilever, for example, promised in 2017 to ensure that all of its plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. Several companies, including Carrefour, Tesco, PepsiCo, and Unilever, have signed up for a pilot waste-reduction program unveiled at Davos, which involves delivering products in reusable bottles and collecting them for cleaning and re-use. The plastic debate has also caught the attention of the insurance industry, with Swiss Re's CEO stating that if companies face lawsuits for their plastic waste, it could impact their ability to obtain insurance coverage. Greenpeace's call for more bans on plastic packaging was met with resistance from Unilever and PepsiCo, who argue that the issue requires multiple solutions, including recycling, re-use, and new packaging technologies. The European Union recently passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items by 2021, but Greenpeace called for further reduction targets. Greenpeace and other critics argue that industry initiatives alone are not enough to solve the plastic waste problem, as many companies are expanding production of single-use plastic. French Secretary of State for Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy, Brune Poirson, criticized the companies for not taking enough initiative and stated that government intervention is necessary.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

63,31225,Women absorb and retain DNA from every man they have had sex with.,"On 23 June 2017, frequent purveyor of misinformation YourNewsWire.com posted an article (“Women Absorb and Retain DNA from Every Man They Have Sex With”) that made the claim that “a new study” demonstrates that cells transferred from a man to a woman during intercourse become integrated into that woman’s body after sex. Every single time. In actuality, however, that study (which was published in PLOS ONE in 2012, despite being billed as “new” in 2017) demonstrated for the first time the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brains of women (who had been examined in autopsy). The existence of male cells in the bodies of females, in general, is not news. As discussed in a PLOS ONE blog post describing that 2012 study, their presence is typically ascribed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy: The idea of two genetically distinct populations of cells, or their DNA, residing in one individual isn’t new. It’s called microchimerism. […] Medical chimerism arises after a transfusion or transplant, and it may follow pregnancy. Our microbiomes, the bacteria within us, are more like guests than body parts. [The research groups responsible for the 2012 study] found Y chromosome DNA sequences in several brain regions in autopsy slides from 37 out of 59 women. Such DNA liberated from fetal cells can come from several sources: children, fetuses that never made it to be born, older siblings, or twins. Both son and daughter DNA partake in this “feto-maternal trafficking,” but female DNA, at the chromosomal level, is harder to detect amid the maternal two X’s. The significance, in the case of that specific research paper, was that it demonstrated that these male cells — wherever they came from — were able to cross what is known as the blood-brain barrier — a semi-permeable membrane that prevents most chemicals in the blood from entering the brain. The linked study, in fact, does not once mention sexual intercourse as a proposed mechanism. This is as close as you will get from the PLOS ONE paper: The most likely source of male [microchimerism, Mc] in female brain is acquisition of fetal Mc from pregnancy with a male fetus. In women without sons, male DNA can also be acquired from an abortion or a miscarriage. The pregnancy history was unknown for all but a few subjects in the current studies, thus male Mc in female brain could not be evaluated according to specific prior pregnancy history. In addition to prior pregnancies, male Mc could be acquired by a female from a recognized or vanished male twin, an older male sibling, or through non-irradiated blood transfusion. At least that’s what they want you to think, according to YourNewsWire: Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial. Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain. At this point the scientists didn’t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from. In an odd chronologic twist that necessitates abandoning the notion that time progresses linearly in one direction, YourNewsWire then used text from a paper published in 2005 to support the argument that scientists buried this salacious truth, discovered in 2012, in other “sub studies”. That 2005 paper, which does indeed show the presence of male cells in women who had never given birth to males (or, in some cases, at all), makes only passing reference to the possibility that sexual intercourse alone could contribute male microchirality to women, noting that the issue has yet to be studied: Another possibility that has not been investigated is whether male DNA can be detected in a woman’s circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy. That explanation is the authors’ speculative fourth suggestion (out of four) after three more plausible, and actually researched, theories: One potential explanation for male microchimerism could be a nonrecognized (male) miscarriage. […] A second potential source is from a “vanished (male) twin.” A vanished twin is thought to be a relatively common phenomena resulting from spontaneous resorption of one sac or embryo in a twin pregnancy. […] A third possibility is from an older male sibling transferred by the maternal circulation to the fetus of a later pregnancy. [i.e. you are born with male DNA your older brother left behind in your mother’s body]. A paper published, fittingly, in the journal Chimerism in 2015 investigated this topic further, concluding that — potentially — all of those potential mechanisms may contribute. That paper, which was fairly limited in its dataset, makes it clear that the sexual intercourse transfer of male chimerism remains entirely speculative: A total of 154 girls were studied of which 21 (13.6%) tested positive for male microchimerism. There was a tendency that girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism if their mothers previously had received transfusion, had given birth to a son or had had a spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, the oldest girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism. However, less than half of microchimerism positivity was attributable to these factors. In conclusion, data suggest that male microchimerism in young girls may originate from an older brother either full born or from a discontinued pregnancy or from transfusion during pregnancy. We speculate that sexual intercourse may be important but other sources of male cells likely exist in young girls. Far from demonstrating that 100 percent of a woman’s male sexual partners have male cells that de facto become part of their body, the studies cobbled together by YourNewsWire show that even if sexual intercourse transferred cells from a male that later became incorporated into the female partner’s body (which science has only speculated about at this point), it clearly wouldn’t happen in all cases.",false,"We are also unsure, for the record, what motivation would exist for scientists to hide the truth about male microchimerism in the first place.","The claim that women absorb and retain DNA from every man they have had sex with is not supported by scientific evidence. The article states that a study published in 2012 demonstrated the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brains of women who had been examined in autopsy. This phenomenon is known as microchimerism and is typically attributed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy. The study did not mention sexual intercourse as a mechanism for the transfer of male cells.

The article also mentions a 2005 paper that showed the presence of male cells in women who had never given birth to males. However, this paper only speculates on the possibility of male DNA being detected in a woman's circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy, and it has not been studied further.

In conclusion, the studies mentioned in the article do not support the claim that women absorb and retain DNA from every man they have had sex with. While there is evidence of male microchimerism in women, it is typically attributed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy or other sources. The transfer of male cells through sexual intercourse remains speculative and has not been extensively studied.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

It also mentioned that this charge is covered by Medicare and most insurers. And it discussed the investment many medical centers have made in the machines – $125,000 – 175,000. The benefits of the technology discussed (or lack of benefit) was reported in absolute number of tumors detected. The harm of treatment – undergoing unecessary biopsy was mentioned. However – the increased number of biopsies was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute value. The story might have mentioned that the use of CAD increased the number of cases of ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS, for which progression to invasive cancer is less certain – meaning that it may not pose a health risk during the woman's lifetime. The benefit of cancer treatment for women with this diagnosis is therefore not clear. Thus enhanced ability to detect DCIS may not affect death from breast cancer. Nonetheless, we'll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. The evidence that breast cancer detection rates did not differ was presented in terms of the absolute number of breast tumors detected. The story included the source of the study it was reporting. The story did not engage in disease mongering. Multiple sources were used, some directly involved in the study and some not. The story described one option to computer-aided detection of mammograms used at one center. It mentioned one breast center in which every mammogram is read by two radiologists, which was described as more effective at finding cancers than a computer system.

66,644,Climate change endangers Scotland's archaeological treasures.,"The Orkney Islands, situated off the north coast of the Scottish mainland, are home to more than 3,000 historical sites. Evidence has been found of human habitation there going back 8,500 years. Some buildings on the islands date to the Iron Age, Viking rule and medieval times. But around 1,000 sites are situated on the coastline and are under threat. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay. Dating from between 600-400AD, the sea has taken much of the site’s western area. Now the broch wall itself is falling into the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, says it will eventually disappear. “What you can see just over here is the front door of the broch, exposed by the sea, taking away parts of the ruins and leaving a built wall still intact. And each year a little more falls as the sea batters it,” she said as she stood on the cliff’s edge. “What we have discovered in recent years, through the use of geophysics and other things, is that... on this stretch of the coastline, all the settlement archaeology is within 100 meters of the coast edge. And so as the sea takes this heritage of ours away it’s taking all that we have,” she said. A couple of hundred meters north of South Howe Broch is Midhowe Broch. This Iron Age building is well-preserved, courtesy of a sea wall built in the 1930s and well-maintained since. A spring-fed water tank, fireplace and room partitions are clearly visible. But even Midhowe Broch is at risk from climate change. A climate risk assessment of Orkney’s Neolithic sites, published by conservation public body Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July this year, described the potential impact of climate change on the sites as “extreme” and their vulnerability as “high”. According to HES, average precipitation (rain, sleet and snow) has increased by 27% in Scotland since the early 1960s. In the same period, winter precipitation has gone up by more than 70% in parts of northern Scotland. Wetter weather means buildings are wetter for longer, meaning water is more likely to penetrate masonry and decay it. It also leads to metal parts of buildings corroding and the ground becoming unstable. This can lead to structural collapse. Sea levels are also rising and beach erosion is a growing problem. Since 1970 some Orkney beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches (40 centimeters) per year since 1970. That is compared to an annual average loss of eight inches between 1890 and 1970, according to data from cross-governmental coastal change assessment partnership Dynamic Coast. Increased storminess also threatens damaging Orkney’s historical sites, HES says. Arguably the most famous site of Orkney is Skara Brae. This Neolithic settlement, occupied from roughly 3100-2500BC, features a network of stone buildings. When inhabited it was approximately one kilometer (0.6 miles) from the sea with a freshwater loch and sand dunes in between. Now it sits only a few meters from the North Atlantic. Visitors can see the settlement’s 5,000-year-old hearths, bed recesses, cupboards and dressers. Some 112,000 people visited it in 2018. “Climate change is a really real present risk. The climate has already changed because of the influence of humans. And it’s going to continue to change and that pace of change is going to speed up,” said HES climate change scientist, David Harkin. “So the risk to sites like Skara Brae and other sites around Orkney, it’s real, it’s here, it’s happening. But it shouldn’t all be doom and gloom and despair. There is an opportunity to still do something about it and to avoid the worst possible consequences of climate change,” he added.",true,"Ancient British structures older than the pyramids are being threatened by climate change, experts have warned, as rising sea levels, heavier rainfall and severe weather events endanger Scotland’s archaeological treasures.","Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change. With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change.

A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970.

Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers. In 2018, it attracted 112,000 visitors.

HES climate change scientist David Harkin emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and protect these archaeological treasures. He acknowledges that climate change is already happening and that the pace of change will accelerate. However, he also believes that there is an opportunity to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and avoid the destruction of sites like Skara Brae.

In conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to Scotland's archaeological treasures on the Orkney Islands. Erosion, increased precipitation, rising sea levels, beach erosion, and storminess are all contributing to the deterioration of these historical sites. Urgent action is needed to protect and preserve these valuable cultural heritage sites.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change.\n\nA climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney\'s Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney\'s beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970.\n\nSkara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers. In 2018, it attracted 112,000 visitors.\n\nHES climate change scientist David Harkin emphasizes the urgent need to address climate change and protect these archaeological treasures. He acknowledges that climate change is already happening and that the pace of change will accelerate. However, he also believes that there is an opportunity to mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and avoid the destruction of sites like Skara Brae.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change poses a significant threat to Scotland\'s archaeological treasures on the Orkney Islands.

67,10900,Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery,"The story rightly points out that the development of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery has significant financial implications: “Atrial fibrillation is also always associated with lengthened hospitalization and that means increased healthcare costs.” But we would have liked to have seen some attention paid to the cost of the intervention, namely multiple injections of botulinum toxin. We calculate the cost of one 4mls vial of Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA) to be approximately $1000. This cost is likely to be rather small in comparison to the cost of extended hospitalizations, antiarrhythmic therapies and lost productivity from atrial fibrillation. The story does a good job in detailing the results of the study and the apparent benefit of botulinum toxin injections in this small sample randomized study. Researchers found that: The story appropriately points out that there were no additional harms seen in the group injected with the botulinum toxin compared to those who received saline other than those associated with the surgery. “No complications from the Botox injections were reported,” according to the release. “But complications from the bypass surgery were similar in both groups, including time in intensive care and on a breathing machine, and infection rate.” The release satisfies this criterion but a few more details would have made the release even better. We are told that 60 subjects were enrolled and were randomly assigned to receive either botulinum toxin of saline. We are also told the study was blinded. Other important details about the study are omitted including baseline differences between the two groups, number of vessels engrafted, duration of bypass or number of off bypass procedures. All are important variables in the development of atrial fibrillation post operatively. Atrial fibrillation post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can dramatically impact the patient’s quality of life as well as potentially increase morbidity. The story does not over state the impact and provides statistics concerning its prevalence. The funding sources (The Russian State Research Institute of Circulation Pathology and the Siberian Division of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences) are noted in the release. Given the impact of post-operative atrial fibrillation, it is reasonable to assume that other attempts have been made to reduce its incidence in this population. A variety of antiarrhythmic drugs and beta adrenergic blockers have been studied with variable results. It would have been very helpful to add a few words about the alternative pharmalogical agents. Since the release makes no claim that this therapy is ready to be used outside of clinical trials we’ll give this a satisfactory. The story makes it clear that botulinum toxin is available and is routinely used in cosmetic dermatology. For that use it’s sold under the trade name Botox Cosmetic. However, there are four different FDA approved strains of the toxin. Various formulations of the toxin have received FDA approval for use in treating excessive sweating, migraines, dystonia, bladder control issues, and several other non-cosmetic conditions. Those formulations have been available for many years as well. Since this is the first time botulinum toxin has been tested in human hearts, it’s safe to say that it could be several years before it receives approval as a preventative for heart complications. The release is clear that larger studies are needed. Dr. Steinberg’s comments on the study being the “first in man” establishes the novelty of the approach. The release does not use unjustifiable language. Instead, the language is very measured and appropriate.",true,"This concise (393 word) news release from the American Heart Association on a trial that used botulinum toxin to prevent irregular heart rhythms after bypass surgery packs a lot of good information into a small frame. The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery.

68,27765,"Getting your hair washed at a beauty salon can, in rare cases, increase the chances of a stroke.","In January 2014, a woman in San Diego, California, went to a local salon to get her hair done. What happened next sounds like the most nightmarish of urban legends: the angle and degree she was tilted in the chair and the way her head tipped back over the sink while the stylist was washing her hair caused Elizabeth Smith to have a stroke two weeks later: “I vomited, my head became hot and I couldn’t stand. I had weakness in my arms and legs. They didn’t think I was going to live,” said Smith, choking back tears. Smith says she could hardly believe what nearly killed her. Her doctors pointed to her time in the shampoo chair. Beauty Parlor Stroke Syndrome is what they called it. It’s a rare but documented condition. Multiple doctors who saw Smith say when her neck was bent backwards, it hyperextended, her vertebrae slicing an artery. A clot began forming, later causing a stroke. “Several of Ms. Smith’s neurologists confirmed with her that the stroke was caused by the vertebra dissecting her artery during her hair wash,” said Smith’s attorney Carree Nahama. The danger is real, although the probability of it happening is low. A study that came out in 1993, subsequently covered by the New York Times, found that older people have a higher risk of a stroke during or after a visit to the beauty salon (Smith was in her late 40s at the time): The patients suffered from a variety of complaints attributable to poor blood flow in arteries leading through the neck to the back of the brain, including severe dizziness, imbalance and facial numbness. Four out of five suffered strokes leading to permanent neurologic damage. “In older people, neck motion beyond a certain degree can be extremely dangerous, particularly hyperextension and rotation,” said Dr. Weintraub, chief of neurology at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y., referring to backward arching and twisting. He and others have suggested that patients receiving anesthesia or undergoing prolonged dental work may also be vulnerable, since they too have their necks arched back abnormally for prolonged periods. A 2006 study also looked into the issue, saying while it probably occurred more than previously thought, the risk of stroke in these cases was easily alleviated: Taken together, hyperextension combined with hanging the head backwards in a hair washbasin can be seen as a risk factor for posterior circulation ischemia. It probably occurs more often than assumed and a number of patients may report about previous dizziness episodes under the same conditions when asked specifically. It can be prevented by changing the shampoo routine from the hanging head position to a flexed or neutral position. Dr. Scott Olson, a vascular neurologist at the University of California, San Diego, told us that while he hasn’t seen this specific case, he has seen this particular injury (more commonly called a “vertebral artery dissection,” which can lead to subsequent clotting and stroke) and it’s not unprecedented: It’s pretty much a fluke. I have seen people who’ve had this happen while surfing, they happen after dental visits. I had an auto mechanic who was working on a car for a day and had his head hanging over a creeper… I had a patient fall asleep in a movie theater and ended up having a dissection. [But] …It’s like a lot of things in life where it’s the same thing you’ve done. I think people should not be inordinately worried about it. I mean, tens of thousands of people across this country have their hair washed at salons every day. It’s very statistically uncommon. He says there are signs to watch for after a potential injury: Things people should pay attention to, should be concerned about? Pain on one side of the neck after extension, and obviously, any neurologic symptoms like vertigo. There’s some genetic disorders, like Marfan Syndrome, hyperextensible joints, or connective tissue disease that will make you more prone. Elizabeth Smith says she racked up $250,000 in medical bills and has permanently lost part of her vision and mobility. She is now suing the salon for damages. On 30 March 2016, we spoke to Smith. She told us: I had no idea that the story would go on, and I’m glad that it has. The two big skepticisms really are — people think that you feel something, but you feel nothing, because your artery has no nerves, so you feel nothing when it happens. So just because you’re like “oh, I’m comfortable,” doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened. The other thing is that the delay from injury to stroke is because you get a little bit of a bleed, and a little bleed won’t clog or occlude your artery. It takes your body time to build a clot big enough to do the damage, roughly two weeks. For me, it was 8 days, but that wasn’t the full stroke.",true,"Just don’t bend your neck back, literally, at all. It can be something as simple as saying, “put five or six towels down.” Don’t bend your neck back, no matter how comfortable you are, or what your stylist says.","In rare cases, getting your hair washed at a beauty salon can increase the chances of having a stroke.

69,27556,"The state of Michigan threatened local beavers with a $10,000 per day fine for failing to remove their dams.","In July 1997, one of Stephen Tvedten’s neighbors noticed flooding on his property and traced it back to a dam on Tvedten’s stream. The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on 28 July 1997, and five months later the agency responded with a letter to the offending land owner. The letter, from David Price, a local Michigan DEQ official, was blunt: The “construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond” was “unauthorized” because “a permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity.” The letter ordered Stephen Tvedten, the land owner, to “cease and desist” under penalty of “elevated enforcement action”: STATE OF MICHIGAN Reply to: GRAND RAPIDS DISTRICT OFFICE STATE OFFICE BUILDING 6TH FLOOR 350 OTTAWA NW GRAND RAPIDS MI 49503-2341 JOHN ENGLER, Governor DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HOLLISTER BUILDING, PO BOX 30473, LANSING MI 48909-7973 INTERNET: RUSSELL J. HARDING, Director December 17, 1997 CERTIFIED Mr. Ryan DeVries 2088 Dagget Pierson, MI 49339 Dear Mr. DeVries: SUBJECT: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023-1 T11N, R10W, Sec. 20, Montcalm County It has come to the attention of the Department of Environmental Quality that there has been recent unauthorized activity on the above referenced parcel of property. You have been certified as the legal landowner and/or contractor who did the following unauthorized activity: Construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond. A permit must be issued prior to the start of this type of activity. A review of the Department’s files show that no permits have been issued. Therefore, the Department has determined that this activity is in violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated. The Department has been informed that one or both of the dams partially failed during a recent rain event, causing debris dams and flooding at downstream locations. We find that dams of this nature are inherently hazardous and cannot be permitted. The Department therefore orders you to cease and desist all unauthorized activities at this location, and to restore the stream to a free-flow condition by removing all wood and brush forming the dams from the strewn channel. All restoration work shall be completed no later than January 31, 1998. Please notify this office when the restoration has been completed so that a follow-up site inspection may be scheduled by our staff. Failure to comply with this request, or any further unauthorized activity on the site, may result in this case being referred for elevated enforcement action. We anticipate and would appreciate your full cooperation in this matter. Please feel free to contact me at this office if you have any questions. Sincerely, David L. Price District Representative Land and Water Management Division Mr. Tvedten responded to the Michigan DEQ’s demand with the now widely-circulated “dam letter,” in which he pointed out that the “debris dams” he had been ordered to remove because they were constructed without permission from the state of Michigan were actually built by beavers: Dear Mr. Price: Re: DEQ File No. 97-59-0023; T11N, R10W, Sec 20; Montcalm County Your certified letter dated 12/17/97 has been handed to me to respond to. You sent out a great deal of carbon copies to a lot of people, but you neglected to include their addresses. You will, therefore, have to send them a copy of my response. First of all, Mr. Ryan DeVries is not the legal landowner and/or contractor at 2088 Dagget, Pierson, Michigan — I am the legal owner and a couple of beavers are in the (State unauthorized) process of constructing and maintaining two wood “debris” dams across the outlet stream of my Spring Pond. While I did not pay for, nor authorize, their dam project, I think they would be highly offended you call their skillful use of natural building materials “debris.” I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic. As to your dam request the beavers first must fill out a dam permit prior to the start of this type of dam activity, my first dam question to you is: are you trying to discriminate against my Spring Pond Beavers or do you require all dam beavers throughout this State to conform to said dam request? If you are not discriminating against these particular beavers, please send me completed copies of all those other applicable beaver dam permits. Perhaps we will see if there really is a dam violation of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resource and Environmental Protection Act, Act 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, being sections 324.30101 to 324.30113 of the Michigan Compiled Laws annotated. My first concern is — aren’t the dam beavers entitled to dam legal representation? The Spring Pond Beavers are financially destitute and are unable to pay for said dam representation — so the State will have to provide them with a dam lawyer. The Department’s dam concern that either one or both of the dams failed during a recent rain event causing dam flooding is proof we should leave the dam Spring Pond Beavers alone rather than harassing them and calling them dam names. If you want the dam stream “restored” to a dam free-flow condition — contact the dam beavers — but if you are going to arrest them (they obviously did not pay any dam attention to your dam letter-being unable to read English) — be sure you read them their dam Miranda rights first. As for me, I am not going to cause more dam flooding or dam debris jams by interfering with these dam builders. If you want to hurt these dam beavers — be aware I am sending a copy of your dam letter and this response to PETA. If your dam Department seriously finds all dams of this nature inherently hazardous and truly will not permit their existence in this dam State — I seriously hope you are not selectively enforcing this dam policy, or once again both I and the Spring Pond Beavers will scream prejudice! In my humble opinion, the Spring Pond Beavers have a right to build their dam unauthorized dams as long as the sky is blue, the grass is green, and water flows downstream. They have more dam right than I to live and enjoy Spring Pond. So, as far as I and the beavers are concerned, this dam case can be referred for more dam elevated enforcement action now. Why wait until 1/31/98? The Spring Pond Beavers may be under the dam ice then, and there will be no dam way for you or your dam staff to contact/harass them then. In conclusion, I would like to bring to your attention a real environmental quality (health) problem: bears are actually defecating in our woods. I definitely believe you should be persecuting the defecating bears and leave the dam beavers alone. If you are going to investigate the beaver dam, watch your step! (The bears are not careful where they dump!) Being unable to comply with your dam request, and being unable to contact you on your dam answering machine, I am sending this response to your dam office. Sincerely, Stephen L. Tvedten The DEQ later claimed they were fully aware the “debris dams” were beaver dams; the issue, they said, was that the beavers who built them had long since abandoned the dams, but Mr. Tvedten had been continuing to maintain and even build up the dams himself: The letter concerned an enforcement action directed to a tenant on property surrounding Spring Pond, which is located in Pierson Township, Montcalm County, Michigan. The tenant was observed by the downstream complainant, and has since admitted to the complainant, that he artificially built up, and maintained two abandoned beaver dams on the discharge end of the natural pond. Such an activity falls under the jurisdiction of Part 301, Inland Lakes and Streams, of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1194 PA 451, as amended. It is the Department’s position that in the absence of any threat to public welfare, beaver dams should be left in their natural state, that being either actively maintained or abandoned by beaver. The Department conducted an on-site inspection of the dams in August of 1997, accompanied by a Department of Natural Resources fisheries biologist, the Pierson Township Supervisor and the complainant. The tenant’s actions, and a threat to the welfare of the downstream complainant prompted our correspondence of December 1997, instructing the tenant to cease and desist all illegal activity and to restore the stream to its prior condition. The owner of the property took issue with our action, and responded with his own version of the situation. It was this correspondence that has been circulating in the internet. Luis Saldivia Grand Rapids District Supervisor Land and Water Management Division 616-356-0208 For his part, Mr. Tvedten claimed that the dams had been “abandoned” because a neighbor had killed the beavers (then filed a complaint with the state because he was concerned that the untended dams would break apart and enter his property) and that no one but the beavers had ever maintained them. And contemporaneous accounts of the brouhaha quoted a Michigan DEQ spokesman as saying the agency hadn’t performed an inspection before firing off their December 1997 letter to Mr. Tvedten: Ken Silfven, public information officer at the state Department of Environmental Quality, said that … the account was correct. He hastened to note, however, that the case was prompted by a complaint from a neighbor who was concerned about flooding caused by the dams. The department dropped its investigation after an inspection by a DEQ employee. “It probably would have been a good idea to do the inspection before we sent the notice,” Silfven said.",true,"After some wrangling the agency ultimately dropped the issue, but not before Stephen Tvedten found an inventive way of quickly pointing out both how ludicrous and humorous the situation was. In a way dusty legal language never could, such a letter serves to drive home the silliness of Michigan DEQ’s intractable posturing. The beavers are likely still ignorant of how close they came to being fined $10,000 a day for dam living expenses.","In July 1997, a neighbor of Stephen Tvedten noticed flooding on his property and traced it back to a dam on Tvedten's stream. The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and five months later, the agency responded with a letter to Tvedten, ordering him to cease and desist the construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond. The letter stated that a permit must be issued prior to this type of activity and failure to comply could result in elevated enforcement action.

Tvedten responded to the DEQ's demand with a letter explaining that the dams were actually built by beavers and not by him. He challenged the DEQ to try and emulate the beavers' dam project and questioned whether the beavers were entitled to legal representation. Tvedten argued that the beavers had the right to build their dams and that the DEQ should focus on other environmental issues, such as bears defecating in the woods.

The DEQ later claimed that they were aware the dams were beaver dams, but the issue was that the beavers had abandoned the dams and Tvedten had been maintaining and building them up himself. The DEQ stated that in the absence of any threat to public welfare, beaver dams should be left in their natural state.

Tvedten argued that the dams were abandoned because a neighbor had killed the beavers and that no one but the beavers had ever maintained them. The DEQ admitted that they had not performed an inspection before sending the letter to Tvedten.

The article summarizes the situation where the state of Michigan threatened local beavers with a $10,000 per day fine for failing to remove their dams. The issue arose when a neighbor complained about flooding caused by the dams, leading the DEQ to send a letter to Tvedten ordering him to cease and desist the construction and maintenance of the dams. Tvedten responded by explaining that the dams were built by beavers and not by him. The DEQ later admitted that they were aware the dams were beaver dams but claimed that Tvedten had been maintaining and building them up himself.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The report includes sufficient detail about the studies’ methodology and outcomes to help readers [eventually] understand the small numbers of children involved and the basic findings. The story states that ""most"" of the 33 patients in the first test appeared to have improved resistance to peanut allergens, that 5 could tolerate peanuts without reaction, and that 4 had to withdraw because they could not tolerate the treatment. The story reports that the second test split the 18 subjects into treatment and placebo groups, and described approximate outcomes for each group. In the last line, the story warns that the children in the studies, who were allergic to peanuts, were under close medical supervision and that ""parents should not try the approach at home."" This is a satisfactory warning about potential harms. But it should have appeared earlier. The author should also have mentioned whether those in the study who ""did not tolerate"" the exposure treatment needed epinephrine or some other intervention to quell the allergic reaction. The news story is based on two presentations of very early studies with small numbers of patients at a medical conference. This is a very low quality of evidence. The report should have made plain from the top that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and that the study groups were very small. It is not until paragraph 6 of a 10-paragraph story that we learn the study is a ""pilot"" and that the number of subjects in the two studies is just 33 and 18. It is not until paragraph 8 that we learn ""[f]ar more study is needed. . . ."" Given the story’s early discussion of a ""cure"" and a treatment within 2-3 years, the discussion of the quality of the evidence wasn’t strong enough nor early enough in the story. No disease-mongering about the seriousness or incidence of these food allergies. The only source quoted is Dr. Wesley Burks of Duke University Medical Center, one of the researchers who presented work at the meeting. The reporter fails to disclose that Burks has financial relationships with a number of drug, food and device companies with an interest in allergies. The reporter should have interviewed at least one additional source with deep knowledge of peanut allergies and no connection to the research. The article states, correctly, that there are no approved treatments for food allergies. The story makes clear that this experimental treatment for peanut allergy is in the early stages of human research, and not available. Ideally it would have made this plain earlier in the story. The report explains that previous British studies of similar treatments have shown similar results. It also states that a U.S. based consortium is conducting studies as well. The reader would not come away believing the treatment being tested is unique. The New York Times article states, ""'[N]early half of the 150 deaths attributed to food allergies in the United States each year are caused by peanut allergies,’ according to Duke University."" A Duke University press release includes this same sentence, with the exception of the words ""in the United States."" This is a minor matter, hardly evidence that the NYT reporter is rewriting a handout. But it’s unsettling nonetheless.",true,"This story on an experimental desensitization treatment for peanut allergies oversells the promise of the research and the importance of the studies. As the ratings below show, the story is poorly sourced and buries a key warning about the treatment. But its main problem is that the reporter lets the ""good news"" [that studies suggest a new regimen may be effective against a serious condition] linger far too long before getting to the ""bad news"" [the studies are unpublished, preliminary, small, brief and inconclusive]. The lede gets in trouble early when it says the treatment ""raises the possibility of a cure for this potentially life-threatening condition."" In the next paragraph it conveys a lead researcher’s assertion that a treatment ""may be developed in two or three years."" Only later come the reminders that these are small pilot studies. This is a common pattern in news reporting: Run with the promise, and let the caveats catch up by the end of the story. The result is that interested readers–in this case, parents of kids with peanut allergies–have their hopes raised and dashed within 350 words.","A recent article titled ""Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise"" discusses a new experimental treatment for peanut allergies that has shown positive results in early studies. The article mentions that the treatment has been tested on a small number of patients, with most of them showing improved resistance to peanut allergens. Five patients were able to tolerate peanuts without any reaction, while four had to withdraw from the study due to intolerance to the treatment. The article also mentions that the second test involved splitting the subjects into treatment and placebo groups, with approximate outcomes for each group described.

However, the article is criticized for not providing enough information about the methodology and outcomes of the studies. It is noted that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and the study groups were very small, consisting of only 33 and 18 subjects. The article should have made it clear from the beginning that the evidence is of low quality and that more study is needed.

The article also fails to provide a sufficient warning about potential harms and the need for close medical supervision. It is mentioned in the last line that parents should not try the approach at home, but this warning should have appeared earlier. Additionally, the article does not mention whether those who did not tolerate the treatment required any intervention to quell allergic reactions.

The only source quoted in the article is Dr. Wesley Burks of Duke University Medical Center, one of the researchers involved in the study. However, it is not disclosed that Burks has financial relationships with companies related to allergies. The article should have included an additional source with no connection to the research.

The article does mention that there are no approved treatments for food allergies and that the experimental treatment for peanut allergy is in the early stages of human research. However, it is suggested that this information should have been made clearer earlier in the story.

Lastly, the article states that nearly half of the deaths attributed to food allergies in the United States each year are caused by peanut allergies, according to Duke University. However, there is a minor discrepancy between the article and a Duke University press release regarding the inclusion of the words ""in the United States.""

Overall, the article highlights the promising results of the experimental treatment for peanut allergies but is criticized for its lack of detail, failure to provide sufficient warnings, and the need for more study.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

71,14192,"Cervical cancer in Africa is ""fully preventable with basic education, screening and vaccines.","Vice President Joe Biden has called for a ""moonshot"" to cure cancer. The disease took his son in 2015, and now it has become his mission to eliminate some cancers and turn the rest into treatable, chronic diseases. Biden took his campaign to the Vatican where he said that ""nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable."" ""Take cervical cancer -- 530,000 new cases are diagnosed each year,"" Biden said. ""270,000 people die each year; 87 percent in developing countries. In Africa, it’s the second-most common cancer after breast cancer. It’s a travesty. But it’s fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" Biden’s comment about cervical cancer in Africa caught our attention. Is cervical cancer fully preventable with the right interventions? A fact-sheet on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website tells us that Biden is almost but not quite right. ""Every year in the U.S., more than 12,000 women get cervical cancer, and 4,000 die from it. 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination."" Now, that is for the United States with a system of doctors, clinics and hospitals that far surpasses anything found in any African nation. If it’s not fully preventable here, it’s difficult to see why the results in Africa would be better. Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University is in the middle of a study on cervical cancer strategies in Africa. Meyerson told us ""Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention."" Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, said the vice president was trying to make a slightly different point. ""The vice president was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable,"" Dubyak said. To be sure, cervical cancer is highly preventable. The journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, says ""cervical cancer is a relatively rare disease in countries that have instituted and maintained national screening programs."" In this light, Biden’s statement draws attention to Africa’s unfortunate distinction. As this World Health Organization map shows, it is a hotspot worldwide for cervical cancer. In every dark blue country, the rate of new cases is over 30.2 per 100,000 women per year. By comparison, the rate in the United States is about 8.1 per 100,000 women per year. Of the 20 nations with the highest incidence of cervical cancer, 16 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Some researchers note there are vast gaps in this cancer data and say the true prevalence ""remains largely unknown."") A 2015 report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, a body of physicians, epidemiologists and cancer researchers, described the key reasons behind the reach of the disease. Screening is sorely lacking. The group found a ""lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, lack of the high-quality laboratories needed for cytology based screening and absence of adequate centres for the evaluation and treatment of identified patients."" Dealing with cervical cancer exposes the many cracks in the health care systems across the region. Richard Wamai, assistant professor of public health at Northeastern University, said the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa are ill equipped for this challenge. ""Detection will require expanding the health service system, which requires investments in infrastructure,"" Wamai said. ""That calls for prioritization which is difficult to do because of competing health demands. Cancer in general is, to me, the most worrying of all other diseases for the continent. There is very little preparation and in many cases policy makers are not yet awoken to this impending tsunami."" Public health experts also say vaccination programs are essential. Some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer and some of those strains can be blocked by vaccines. But just as Sub-Saharan countries lack the infrastructure for screening, they also lack a system for vaccinating young women. Speaking at a January 2016 event in Washington, Deborah Birx, U.S. Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy, gave a bleak summary of the status of health care in Sub-Saharan Africa. ""There is no systematic health care for girls between the time they turn 5 and the time they get pregnant,"" Birx said. That age range would be key for any vaccination program. On top of that core challenge, Meyerson said the price tag for vaccines puts them out of reach. ""Many African countries find that the HPV vaccination cost is too high to have broad coverage,"" Meyerson said. Our ruling Biden said cervical cancer in Africa is ""fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. We rate the claim .",true,"Biden said cervical cancer in Africa is ""fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines."" The experience of the developed countries shows that nearly all deaths from cervical cancer could be eliminated with widespread screening and vaccination programs. Neither currently exist in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.","The article discusses Vice President Joe Biden's call for a ""moonshot"" to cure cancer and his statement that nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable. Specifically, Biden mentions cervical cancer in Africa as being fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. However, the article argues that while cervical cancer is highly preventable, it is not fully preventable in Africa due to various challenges.

The article cites a fact-sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which states that in the United States, 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination. However, the article questions whether the same results can be achieved in Africa, given the differences in healthcare systems.

Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University, states that Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention of cervical cancer. Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, clarifies that Biden was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable, rather than claiming it is fully preventable.

The article highlights the high incidence of cervical cancer in Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It mentions a report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, which identifies a lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, and a lack of high-quality laboratories and treatment centers as key reasons behind the reach of the disease.

The article also emphasizes the need for vaccination programs in Sub-Saharan Africa, as some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer. However, the lack of infrastructure for screening and vaccinating young women, as well as the high cost of vaccines, pose significant challenges.

In conclusion, the article disputes Biden's claim that cervical cancer in Africa is fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. While cervical cancer is highly preventable, the lack of infrastructure and resources in Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, make it difficult to achieve the same level of prevention as in developed countries.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America.

72,4447,New genetic links to same-sex sexual behavior found.,"The genome-wide research on DNA from nearly half a million U.S. and U.K. adults identified five genetic variants not previously linked with gay or lesbian sexuality. The variants were more common in people who reported ever having had a same-sex sexual partner. That includes people whose partners were exclusively of the same sex and those who mostly reported heterosexual behavior. The researchers said thousands more genetic variants likely are involved and interact with factors that aren’t inherited, but that none of them cause the behavior nor can predict whether someone will be gay. The research “provides the clearest glimpse yet into the genetic underpinnings of same-sex sexual behavior,” said co-author Benjamin Neale, a psychiatric geneticist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “We also found that it’s effectively impossible to predict an individual’s sexual behavior from their genome. Genetics is less than half of this story for sexual behavior but it’s still a very important contributing factor,” Neale said. The study was released Thursday by the journal Science. Results are based on genetic testing and survey responses. Some of the genetic variants found were present in both men and women. Two in men were located near genes involved in male-pattern baldness and sense of smell, raising intriguing questions about how regulation of sex hormones and smell may influence same-sex behavior. Importantly, most participants were asked about frequency of same-sex sexual behavior but not if they self-identified as gay or lesbian. Fewer than 5% of U.K. participants and about 19% of U.S. participants reported ever having a same-sex sexual experience. The researchers acknowledged that limitation and emphasized that the study’s focus was on behavior, not sexual identity or orientation. They also note that the study only involved people of European ancestry and can’t answer whether similar results would be found in other groups. Origins of same-sex behavior are uncertain. Some of the strongest evidence of a genetic link comes from studies in identical twins. Many scientists believe that social, cultural, family and other biological factors are also involved, while some religious groups and skeptics consider it a choice or behavior that can be changed. A Science commentary notes that the five identified variants had such a weak effect on behavior that using the results “for prediction, intervention or a supposed ‘cure’ is wholly and unreservedly impossible.” “Future work should investigate how genetic predispositions are altered by environmental factors,” University of Oxford sociologist Melinda Mills said in the commentary. Other experts not involved in the study had varied reactions. Dr. Kenneth Kendler a specialist in psychiatric genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University, called it “a very important paper that advances the study of the genetics of human sexual preference substantially. The results are broadly consistent with those obtained from the earlier technologies of twin and family studies suggesting that sexual orientation runs in families and is moderately heritable.” Former National Institutes of Health geneticist Dean Hamer said the study confirms “that sexuality is complex and there are a lot of genes involved,” but it isn’t really about gay people. “Having just a single same sex experience is completely different than actually being gay or lesbian,” Hamer said. His research in the 1990s linked a marker on the X chromosome with male homosexuality. Some subsequent studies had similar results but the new one found no such link. Doug Vanderlaan, a University of Toronto psychologist who studies sexual orientation, said the absence of information on sexual orientation is a drawback and makes it unclear what the identified genetic links might signify. They “might be links to other traits, like openness to experience,” Vanderlaan said. The study is a collaboration among scientists including psychologists, sociologists and statisticians from the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and Australia. They did entire human genome scanning, using blood samples from the U.K. Biobank and saliva samples from customers of the U.S.-based ancestry and biotech company 23andMe who had agreed to participate in research. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner . ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives %href_on(file:",true,"The largest study of its kind found new evidence that genes contribute to same-sex sexual behavior, but it echoes research that says there are no specific genes that make people gay.","A genome-wide research study on DNA from nearly half a million U.S. and U.K. adults has identified five genetic variants that were more common in people who reported ever having had a same-sex sexual partner.

73,16261,"Scott Brown Says Jeanne Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax.","In an Oct. 21, 2014, debate in Concord, N.H., Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, tangled over energy policy. At one point, Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" We thought we’d take a closer look. This claim echoed, but did not precisely match, one made in a June press release by Brown’s campaign manager, Colin Reed -- that ""one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax."" This referred to the debate surrounding a ""carbon tax"" -- another term for taxes on oil, gas and coal usage. The logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources that have a smaller environmental impact. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen’s vote on an amendment to a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. The amendment stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form. Shaheen voted in favor of the amendment. However, nothing in that amendment would have actually enacted a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were ever enacted, would be put to use. ""I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are,"" Whitehouse told reporters in 2013. ""So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds."" Although Shaheen was one of 41 ""yea"" votes (all of them coming from Democrats or Democratic-caucusing Independents), the vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax. It would have been accurate to say Shaheen voted to ""pave the way"" for a carbon tax if she had cast a vote to -- for instance -- begin Senate debate on an actual carbon tax. But no carbon tax was waiting for a vote. The amendment she voted for wouldn’t have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition. (And don’t forget that the measure didn’t even pass, so it’s not as if it paved the way for a tax that’s now in place.) A second piece of evidence offered by Brown’s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate. In 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within a budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Shaheen ""paved the way"" for a carbon tax when no proposal was going anywhere in the Senate. Shripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen’s Senate office, told us in June that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. Shah said Shaheen supports ""market-driven solutions"" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it’s ""easier to sell to the population"" and ""puts the onus"" on the polluters. When it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen’s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency. Shaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. The bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote. Our ruling Brown said Shaheen ""voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."" That’s misleading.

74,16759,North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final.,"Germany may have won the 2014 World Cup, but the tournament featuring soccer’s best has left the anonymous producer of the YouTube channel Korea News Backup with good reason to pop the champagne. Its mock video of a North Korean news broadcast previewing the final match has garnered over 8 million views. The video’s charm? It appears to tell North Koreans that their team made it to the final and will face the powerhouse team from Portugal. We at PunditFact took an interest because bloggers, and maybe even some journalists, thought North Korea was actually trying to put one over on its citizens. We want to be clear: The video is a fake. But a writer for the blog Outside the Beltway posted, ""North Korea is telling its people that their men’s national team is in the World Cup final."" The bulk of the post is a copy and paste from an article on the British website, Metro: ""We’ve known for a long time now that supreme leader Kim Jong-un controls the flow of information to his people, with the television channels only reporting positive stuff about the country. ""But in a report posted on YouTube, the media have been caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup. ""The report says North Korea’s brave side crushed Japan 7-0, USA 4-0 and China 2-0 in the group stages, before going on to reach the final… against Portugal. ""Of course, the real final, which takes place this Sunday, is between Germany and Argentina."" The Outside the Beltway blogger observes at the end, ""This is yet another example of just how pervasive the Kim dictatorship is, and just how hard it will likely be to integrate this nation into the real world when that regime finally falls."" We emailed the blogger and didn’t hear back. Curiously, by the time other readers saw the Metro article he linked to, it said something quite different from the words he quoted. The second sentence was key. ""But in a brilliant spoof report posted on YouTube, the media appears to be caught broadcasting that North Korea are on course to win the biggest prize in football, despite not actually qualifying for the World Cup,"" the Metro article said. We emailed the Metro sports writer to see if the article had been changed from the original but again, no word back. So it’s possible that that sports writer had also been pulled in, but we can’t say. From the comments on the Outside the Beltway blog, it is clear that while most readers doubted the newscast’s authenticity, others were ready to believe that the North Korean propaganda machine was aiming for a personal best in the disinformation category. A dose of reality There are several reasons the North Korean government would be unlikely to try such a stunt. For one, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the games, although not live. Also, most North Koreans would likely know that about two years ago, their team failed to qualify for the World Cup. It ranks 137 in the FIFA world rankings; only 32 countries get to compete. Soccer stat maven and professor of government at Cornell University Chris Anderson said ""making it to the final is basically impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds."" Stephen Epstein, a specialist in Korean culture and society at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, noted several elements in the video would instantly tell a trained viewer that it was a joke. ""As soon as I saw it, I knew what it was,"" Epstein said. ""The way the women was speaking, her accent, sounded like a South Korean broadcaster. Also she used the word ‘fighting’ (an English word brought over to South Korea). It clearly was not from the north."" In fact, Epstein said he thinks only people outside South Korea ""were suckered."" But he said that’s understandable. ""If you don’t have a real familiarity with North Korea and just know what Western media generally provides, this would fit with a preconceived stereotype,"" Epstein said. A mountain birth and a golf score It’s not as though North Korea doesn’t exercise creative license. According to the official biography of its previous leader Kim Jong Il, he was born on Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture. In reality, historians place his birth on Russian soil near Vladivostok where his father lived in a camp for Korean exiles. There’s also another sports myth, and this one is interesting because it has morphed over time. In 1994, the Agence France Presse news service said the golf pro at the Pyongyang golf course told a reporter with the Australian Financial Review that Kim Jong Il had scored 5 holes-in-one on his very first time on the links. ""He is an excellent golfer,"" the pro told the reporter. What’s notable about this factoid is that it was first ascribed to the golf pro alone, with no witnesses, as told to a named Australian reporter. By 2003, the New York Post had it at 11 holes-in-one. In 2011, the golf website Cybergolf.com had the 11, plus that the feat was witnessed by 17 security guards and ""dutifully reported to the North Korean masses by the state news agency."" With golf as with soccer, stories about North Korea seem to have the ability to take on a life of their own. Our ruling Bloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final. The video was satire and bore unmistakable markings, for any Korean speaker, of having not come from the communist country. Plus, North Korea had been broadcasting the World Cup and any soccer fan there would know that their team failed to qualify. We rate the claim .",false,"Bloggers said that North Korea was telling its people that the national team was in the World Cup final. The video was satire and bore unmistakable markings, for any Korean speaker, of having not come from the communist country. Plus, North Korea had been broadcasting the World Cup and any soccer fan there would know that their team failed to qualify.","The article discusses a YouTube video that appears to be a North Korean news broadcast previewing the final match of the 2014 World Cup. The video suggests that North Korea's team made it to the final and will face Portugal. However, the video is actually a fake and was created by an anonymous producer of the YouTube channel Korea News Backup. The article mentions that some bloggers and journalists believed that North Korea was trying to deceive its citizens with this video. However, the video is clearly a spoof and not an actual news broadcast.

The article also addresses the reasons why the North Korean government would be unlikely to attempt such a stunt. Firstly, state-controlled media had been broadcasting the World Cup games, although not live. Additionally, most North Koreans would be aware that their team failed to qualify for the World Cup two years prior. The article quotes experts who explain that making it to the final would be impossible for North Korea on sporting grounds.

The article also highlights some examples of creative license exercised by the North Korean government. For instance, the official biography of the previous leader, Kim Jong Il, claimed that he was born on Mount Baekdu, a sacred place in Korean culture. However, historians believe he was actually born on Russian soil near Vladivostok. Another example is a sports myth that Kim Jong Il scored multiple holes-in-one during his first time playing golf. The details of this myth have changed over time, with different sources reporting different numbers of holes-in-one.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that North Korea was telling its people that their national team was in the World Cup final. The video in question is a satire and not an actual news broadcast. The article also provides reasons why the North Korean government would not attempt such a stunt and highlights other instances of creative license exercised by the government.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

75,1308,Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.,"In the short term, though, GSK faces a problem. While more than 1.5 million Americans have received Shingrix since the end of last year, others are having to wait, prompting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to warn of shortages. GSK said it had increased deliveries significantly and was vaccinating people against shingles far faster than in the past, when Merck & Co’s Zostavax was the only product available. But it acknowledged it was struggling to keep up. “The arrival of Shingrix has been met with an unprecedented level of demand from patients and healthcare professionals,” a spokesman said. “Healthcare professionals are vaccinating with Shingrix at a rate many times that of prior years, so ordering limits and intermittent shipping delays should be expected for Shingrix during 2018.” The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck’s older and less effective vaccine in adults 50 years and older, spurring the current strong demand. Consensus forecasts currently point to peak annual sales for Shingrix of around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion), according to Thomson Reuters data, with the U.S. market the main driver. But this number may prove to be too low, according Exane BNP analysts. The brokerage reckons sales could rise to 3 billion pounds if Shingrix can achieve market penetration rates of around 60 percent - double the level seen with Zostavax but similar to levels achieved by Pfizer’s pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. GSK said in April that Shingrix had got off to a flying start, with sales of 110 million pounds in its first full quarter on the market and 2018 sales expected to top 400 million. A company spokesman declined to give any update on that forecast ahead of second-quarter results next month. Shingrix is a key new product for GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley as she strives to improve the company’s commercial performance. It is also crucial for showing the profit potential of GSK’s large vaccines business, where GSK is looking to expand margins. GSK has already achieved its mid-term goal of getting vaccine margins to 30 percent and Exane BNP believes it could hit 35 percent by 2020, helped by the roll-out of Shingrix and other premium vaccines like Bexsero and Menveo against meningitis. Shingrix is given in two doses, separated by two to six months, while Zostavax is a single shot. Ensuring patients adhere to the two-shot regimen will be important in achieving the vaccine’s full sales potential. Shingles is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus that is also responsible for chickenpox. Nearly all adults over 50 have the virus dormant in their nervous system and are at risk of it being reactivated with advancing age.",true,"GlaxoSmithKline is facing “unprecedented” demand for its new shingles vaccine Shingrix, suggesting the product could be a bigger money-spinner than the company and analysts initially thought.","GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply.

76,5755,Senate OKs Coast Guard bill with ballast water compromise.,"The plan, part of a $10.6 billion Coast Guard budget authorization bill, includes provisions sought by environmentalists as well as the cargo shipping industry. They have battled for years over how to regulate disposal of water stored in tanks that is essential for steadying vessels in rough seas but has brought unwanted mussels, fish and even viruses to U.S. waters. Under the bill, approved 94-6 and sent to the House for consideration, the Environmental Protection Agency would set national rules for ballast and other water discharges while the Coast Guard would enforce them. An earlier version backed by industry would have put the Coast Guard in charge of regulation and exempted ballast from the Clean Water Act, which environmentalists feared would result in weaker requirements for treating the water before it’s released. But in a victory for shippers, states would be prohibited from imposing tougher treatment rules than EPA’s. Presently, 26 states have rules in addition to those on federal level, creating what the industry describes as a confusing regulatory patchwork. Environmentalists contend states should be able to exceed federal standards to safeguard their waterways. The bill creates an exception for the Great Lakes, where damages and control costs from quagga mussels and other exotic organisms reach $200 million annually. Regional requirements could be imposed there if enough of the eight states that border the lakes want them. Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, said EPA policy required under the bill “will help prevent pollution and ensure that that ballast water does not transport invasive species from one body of water to another along a vessel’s shipping route, while providing greater regulatory certainty for the shipping industry.” Debate will persist even if the measure is enacted. Federal policy currently limits numbers of live organisms in ballast water before it’s discharged, based on international standards that environmentalists contend are too weak. A federal court has ordered EPA to strengthen the standards, noting the availability of treatment tools such as chlorine, ultraviolet light and filtration. Shippers contend available technology can’t hit the cleanliness targets environmentalists want. EPA will grapple with such issues as it develops national rules. Still, both sides praised the bill. The Lake Carriers’ Association, representing Great Lakes cargo shippers, said it strikes a “good balance,” while an environmentalist coalition said it “upholds many core protections to prevent future invasions.” The bill authorizes $10.6 billion for the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2019, a roughly 16 percent increase from 2017 that would help modernize its aging fleet of cutters and aircraft. The Coast Guard is the primary federal authority for maritime safety and security on the U.S. coast and in ports and inland waterways. “Passing it will ensure the Coast Guard has the tools it needs to continue to carry out its many important missions,” said Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat. The measure also contains provisions to help the agency crack down on drug smuggling and enforce borders through use of informants and greater cooperation with other agencies. It also boost efforts to place and maintain navigational aids and enter less expensive contracts for acquiring the largest and most technologically advanced cutters. Other provisions would create a Coast Guard center to develop responses to oil spills in the Great Lakes and other freshwater environments and authorize funding to design and build a National Coast Guard Museum in New London, Connecticut. ___ AP reporter Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this story.",true,"The U.S. Senate approved a compromise policy Wednesday on dumping ship ballast water in coastal ports and the Great Lakes, a practice blamed for spreading invasive species that damage the environment and the economy.","The Senate has approved a Coast Guard budget authorization bill that includes provisions for regulating the disposal of ballast water, which is used to stabilize vessels in rough seas but can introduce unwanted organisms to US waters. The bill, which has been sent to the House for consideration, would see the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set national rules for ballast and other water discharges, with the Coast Guard responsible for enforcement. The bill also prohibits states from imposing stricter treatment rules than those set by the EPA, except in the Great Lakes region, where regional requirements could be imposed if enough of the eight states that border the lakes want them.

The current federal policy limits the number of live organisms in ballast water before it is discharged, but environmentalists argue that the international standards are too weak. The EPA has been ordered by a federal court to strengthen the standards, but shippers claim that the technology available cannot meet the cleanliness targets demanded by environmentalists.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.,"In a speech in Shenandoah, Iowa, Clinton made a campaign issue out of a ham and cheese sandwich. She said the federal government ""is not taking the steps necessary to protect us"" because of inadequate inspections of toys and food. She cited this example: ""A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects manufacturers daily. But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects manufacturers about once every five years."" To find out if her sandwich example was correct, we turned to government reports on food safety, interviewed the head of the USDA's food inspection service and studied the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, a fascinating manual that provides rules for Wiener schnitzel (""a veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour and bread crumbs, and frying to a golden brown"") and vinegar pickle (""sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5""). The manual also spells out which foods are under USDA jurisdiction. We found that Clinton is correct about the regulation of sandwiches and the big disparity in inspections by the two agencies. In an interview with PolitiFact last week, Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged that the sandwich rule is silly. ""There is no rationale or logic that I can explain to anybody,"" he said. ""It defies logic."" He said the rules don't affect the safety of the nation's food supply, but said, ""it's an issue that makes it look like we don't know what we're doing."" Raymond didn't know the origin of the sandwich rule, but others suggested that the volume of meat might have been the key factor in whether it was FDA or USDA jurisdiction. (The rule only applies to plants that assemble sandwiches for retail stores like 7-Elevens. Sandwiches made-to-order at a deli or a Subway store are not subject to the inspections, Raymond said.) To understand the strange bureaucratic turf of food inspections, you have to go back to the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle , which described horrific conditions at meat plants. That book, still required reading in many high school English classes, had such impact that it persuaded Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt to enact a law requiring meat inspections. Roosevelt had called for a law that would require oversight ""from the hoof to the can."" Since then, the government has put considerable emphasis on meat and poultry, which fall under the USDA. The agency's 7,500 inspectors and veterinarians conduct continuous daily inspections of the nation's meat and poultry plants. The law requires USDA inspections before the products can be sold. But other foods have not gotten the same scrutiny. Most are regulated by the FDA, but the law does not mandate inspection frequencies, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The report confirms that Clinton is correct that, on average, the FDA inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years. ""There is no rhyme or reason to how we regulate food today in the U.S.,"" said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""It's based on antiquated laws and bifurcated agencies. The current food safety system doesn't protect the public."" Without a mandate for regular inspections, the FDA hasn't gotten enough money to do them more frequently. Smith Dewaal said the agency is ""really starving for resources."" Her complaints are echoed in a new report from an FDA advisory panel. The November 2007 report for the agency's Science Board said the FDA is so overburdened and underfunded that it can't effectively conduct routine surveillance. ""The nation's food supply is at risk,"" the report said. And so we find that Sen. Clinton has a legitimate beef on ham and cheese. We find her claim to be .",true,A legitimate beef with ham sandwich regulations,"The article discusses a claim made by Hillary Clinton during a campaign speech in Shenandoah, Iowa. Clinton argued that the federal government is not adequately protecting the public due to insufficient inspections of toys and food. She used the example of a ham and cheese sandwich to illustrate her point, stating that a sandwich on one slice of bread falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which conducts daily inspections of manufacturers. However, a sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only inspects manufacturers about once every five years.

To verify Clinton's claim, the article refers to government reports on food safety, interviews with the head of the USDA's food inspection service, and the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. It confirms that Clinton's example is correct, highlighting the significant disparity in inspections conducted by the two agencies. Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged the absurdity of the sandwich rule and admitted that it defies logic. However, he stated that the rule does not impact the safety of the nation's food supply.

The article explains that the distinction between USDA and FDA jurisdiction over sandwiches can be traced back to Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, published in 1906. The book exposed horrific conditions in meat plants and led to the enactment of a law requiring meat inspections. Since then, the USDA has focused on meat and poultry inspections, while other foods fall under the FDA's purview. The FDA, however, does not have a mandate for regular inspections, and a report by the Government Accountability Office confirms that the agency inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years on average.

Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, criticizes the current food safety system, stating that it is based on antiquated laws and divided agencies. She argues that the lack of regular inspections and insufficient funding for the FDA puts the public at risk. These concerns are echoed in a report from an FDA advisory panel, which states that the agency is overburdened and underfunded, making it unable to effectively conduct routine surveillance of the nation's food supply.

In conclusion, the article confirms that Hillary Clinton's claim about the regulation of sandwiches and the disparity in inspections by the USDA and FDA is accurate. It highlights the historical background of the distinction between the two agencies and raises concerns about the current food safety system's ability to protect the public.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected.

80,18240,"The state GOP ticket ""says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control.","Members of the Democratic state ticket gathered recently in Richmond for their first campaign rally an immediately labeled their Republican opponents as extremists. ""The Tea Party ticket says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control,"" Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, told a crowd of about 150 at the Hippodrome Theater in Jackson Ward. The claim caught our attention. There’s no doubt that the members of the GOP slate -- gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, lieutenant governor candidate E.W. Jackson and attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain -- are strongly opposed to abortion. But have they really said their No. 1 goal is to ban abortion and some forms of contraception? We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for proof and spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to a comment Cuccinelli made at a February 2012 rally to support personhood legislation. The bill, which defined life as beginning at conception, had passed the House when Cuccinelli spoke but would subsequently die in the Senate. ""It’s hard to believe we actually have to come and advocate for something as basic as life, but we’ve had to do it for decades and we’re going to have to do it for the rest of our lives,"" The Washington Times quoted Cuccinelli as saying. ""The fight for life is going to last for all of our lives."" Schwerin cited various press reports and other materials saying the personhood measure would lead to a ban on all abortions and forms of birth control that prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. But this Truth-O-Meter is not about the consequences of personhood legislation. We are examining whether the GOP ticket has proclaimed that ending abortion and certain types of contraception is its top priority. So Cuccinelli’s comments at the rally are immaterial. There are plenty of instances when members of the GOP ticket opposed abortion. Cuccinelli helped muscle through controversial new regulations that require clinics performing abortions to comply with building code standards for hospitals -- an action that was criticized as a ruse to force clinics to close. In a May 18 speech at the Republican state convention accepting the gubernatorial nomination, Cuccinelli called for ""defending those at both ends of life -- protecting the elderly from abuse as well as the unborn."" Jackson, the lieutenant governor nominee, has called abortion ""genocide."" And Obenshain, running for attorney general, has consistently voted to restrict abortion rights during his nine years in the state Senate. But when it comes to identifying the most important issue facing voters this fall, Cuccinelli has said it’s the economy. He was asked in a Jan. 3 radio interview on The John Fredericks Show how a Cuccinelli administration would differ from current GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell. ""In some ways it would be very similar,"" Cuccinelli replied. ""Certainly the same top priority of focusing on economic opportunity would be the same in a Cuccinelli administration."" And in a May 7 news conference announcing his tax plan, Cuccinelli said ""as governor, job creation will be my top priority."" We asked McAuliffe’s spokesman if he had any other evidence that Cuccinelli and his running mates have stated that ending abortions and restricting birth control are their main reasons for running this year. Schwerin pointed to comments Cuccinelli made last September during a visit to Prison Fellowship, a Lansdowne-based ministry. ""Start with the priorities. Work your way down: life, family, community, world -- a lot of ways to affect the ones at the bottom,"" Cuccinelli said. ""It gets narrower and narrower as you get to the top. None of those other rights matter a whole lot if you don’t get born."" Schwerin provided another snippet of a clip, this one from Cuccinelli’s appearance at a June 2011 conference of homeschoolers in Herndon. ""And that’s where the candidate’s responsibility arises. You give a campaign purpose. My purpose was to fight abortion, to shrink government, to protect life and families,"" Cuccinelli said. That establishes once again that one of Cuccinelli’s key reasons for entering politics is to oppose abortion. But it falls short of a declaration by the GOP ticket of its No. 1 goal. Our ruling McAuliffe claimed the GOP ticket ""says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control."" A compelling argument can be made that members of the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and those actions could ban certain types of birth control. But McAuliffe went an extra step and put words in the mouths of his opponents. We rate McAuliffe’s statement .",false,"McAuliffe claimed the GOP ticket ""says their top priority is a career-long mission to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control."" A compelling argument can be made that members of the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and those actions could ban certain types of birth control. But McAuliffe went an extra step and put words in the mouths of his opponents.","Members of the Democratic state ticket in Virginia have labeled their Republican opponents as extremists, claiming that their top priority is to outlaw abortion in all cases and ban some common forms of birth control. The claim was made by Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, during a campaign rally in Richmond. McAuliffe's campaign pointed to a comment made by Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli at a rally in 2012, where he advocated for personhood legislation. However, the Truth-O-Meter fact-checking website argues that this comment is not relevant to the claim at hand. While it is clear that the GOP ticket opposes abortion, there is no evidence that they have proclaimed ending abortion and restricting birth control as their top priority. Cuccinelli has stated that his top priority is the economy and job creation. McAuliffe's campaign also provided snippets of other comments made by Cuccinelli, where he expressed his opposition to abortion, but again, these fall short of a declaration of their top priority. The article concludes that while it is likely that the GOP ticket will do everything possible to restrict abortions and potentially ban certain types of birth control, McAuliffe's claim goes beyond what has been stated by his opponents.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question.

81,27718,A man was arrested after sugar from his Krispy Kreme donuts tested positive for methamphetamine during a traffic stop.,"In December 2015, Daniel Frederick Rushing was arrested when he was leaving a 7-Eleven in Orlando, Florida. That particular convenience store is apparently a locus of illegal activity, and since Rushing had been in and out of it a few times that day, police were suspicious. They pulled him over, found a few flakes of a “rock like substance” that looked suspicious on his floorboard, and — according to the police report — arrested him for possession of methamphetamine after a field test: A silver 4-door Chevy pulled into the 7-11 and parked. A white male, later identified as Daniel Frederick Rushing entered the 7-11 for a very brief moment and then exited the store without making a purchase. Rushing drove away and then returned a few minutes later with a black female employee of the 7-11. Rushing went back into the store and then left with the female a short time later. As Rushing was leaving the parking lot of the 7-11, he made no attempt to stop before entering the roadway to travel East on Colonial Drive (in violation of Florida state statute). Rushing then traveling north onto Parramore Avenue where the speed limit was 30 miles per hour. I paced Rushing at 42 miles per hour (with my certified calibrated speedometer) in the 30 mile per hour zone. For those two infractions I conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle at Parramore and Robinson. When I made contact with Rushing I asked him for his driver license. When Rushing opened his wallet I observed a concealed weapons permit. I asked Rushing if he was armed and he stated that he was. For my safety, I asked Rushing to step out of the vehicle. When Rushing exited the vehicle, I observed in plain view a rock like substance on the floor board where his feet were. I recognized, through my eleven years of training and experience as a law enforcement officer, the substance to be some sort of narcotic. I removed the firearm (a loaded revolver) from Rushing and placed it in my vehicle for my safety. Additionally, I asked Rushing if he had anything illegal in his vehicle and he stated no. I asked Rushing if I could search his vehicle and he stated yes. Officer Vance (17448) and Officer Rolle (18874) arrived to assist me with the traffic stop. I retrieved the substance that I initially saw on the floor board and two other small pieces from the floor board of the driver side. Officer Vance found an additional piece of the same substance in between the driver seat and the door area. I field tested the substance and I received a positive indication for the presence of amphetamines. I conducted a separate test on the substance and received another positive indication for amphetamines. I provided Rushing his rights per Miranda. Rushing stated that he has never done any drugs in his life and he has no idea how the substance got in his vehicle. Rushing stated that the substance is sugar from a Krispy Kreme donut that he ate. Rushing was placed under arrest and charged with possession of amphetamine with a weapon. The “rock-like substance,” as it turned out, really was glaze from the Krispy Kreme donut that Rushing had been eating as he was driving one friend to the hospital for a chemotherapy appointment, before picking up another friend who needed a ride home. Rushing was jailed for ten hours. “It was incredible,” he told reporters: It feels scary when you haven’t done anything wrong and get arrested. … It’s just a terrible feeling. Several weeks after Rushing’s arrest, the lab reports came back showing no trace of methamphetamines or any other types of illegal substances. He has now hired a lawyer, and plans to sue the city because he was arrested for no reason at all. (Orlando police said that the arrest was lawful.) It’s not the first time field tests have mistaken sugary substances for methamphetamines or crack cocaine. In July 2016, investigative journalist outfit ProPublica found that up to half of the positive results from the $2 drug kits Florida police use for field testing are later invalidated: In one notable Florida episode, Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies produced 15 false positives for methamphetamine in the first seven months of 2014. When we examined the department’s records, they showed that officers, faced with somewhat ambiguous directions on the pouches, had simply misunderstood which colors indicated a positive result. According to a 2015 story published by The Marshall Project, a reporting initiative about the United States criminal justice system, the tests yield false positives at least five percent of the time: Sage has been mistaken for marijuana; motor oil for heroin; jolly ranchers for meth; and breath mints for crack. In February, a Minnesota man spent months in jail after his vitamin powder tested positive for amphetamines. Soon after the arrest in Tampa, a Hillsborough police lieutenant conducted his own experiment on the NARK II tests, which cost between $15 and $20 for a box of ten. He found that just opening the test bag to the air produced the same shade of purple as exposure to methamphetamine, according to an internal memo. In February, the Hillsborough sheriff’s department announced it had switched to a different field test, made by the same company, which tests for a wider variety of illegal drugs. A spokeswoman for the sheriff’s department declined interview requests. In Austin, Texas, the field tests law enforcement was using yielded so many false positives that they stopped relying on field tests for drug-related indictments in 2013, instead returning to far slower lab test results for suspected drug offenses. No central agency regulates what drug tests are used in police departments, and there are no centralized or comprehensive records about their use.",true,"In October 2016, Rushing sued the city of Orlando and The Safariland Group, which manufactures and distributes the drug testing kits used by Orlando police.

He was jailed for ten hours before lab reports came back showing no trace of illegal substances.

This incident is not an isolated case. Investigative journalists found that up to half of the positive results from the $2 drug kits used by Florida police for field testing are later invalidated. In one instance, Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies produced 15 false positives for methamphetamine in just seven months. The tests have been known to mistake harmless substances like sage, motor oil, jolly ranchers, and breath mints for illegal drugs. In another case, a Minnesota man spent months in jail after his vitamin powder tested positive for amphetamines.

The article also mentions that there is no central agency regulating the use of drug tests in police departments, and there are no comprehensive records about their use. In Austin, Texas, law enforcement stopped relying on field tests for drug-related indictments in 2013 due to the high number of false positives. Instead, they returned to slower lab test results for suspected drug offenses.

82,1972,Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.,"People line up to buy food at a fast food restaurant in Harlem in New York December 16, 2009. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly The number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults rose to 4.8 in 2006 from 3.8 in 1977, according to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researchers who examined surveys of daily eating habits over a 30-year period. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks rose to seven from five. The analysis also found that although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, but the number of total calories consumed is rising. By 2006, the end of the period studied, Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day than they did in the late 1970s. A chief culprit behind the calorie gain: Americans now consume 220 more calories daily from sugar-sweetened soft drinks than they did in the 1960s, the study found. The study is thought to be the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people’s total calorie consumption. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, and the findings appear in the June 2011 issue of the journal PLoS Medicine. Kiyah Duffey, a postdoctoral fellow at the UNC Interdisciplinary Obesity Center and one of the study’s authors, said large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. “Around the time people became aware of the portion sizes, we see a decline in the portion sizes they are consuming,” Duffey told Reuters. “It really seems that in the last couple of decades, it is the number of eating occasions that is driving this change.” A proliferation of food availability and a decline in regular mealtimes may be fueling the pattern, Duffey said. “People aren’t sitting down to three meals anymore,” she said. “We sort of think about eating all through the day.” Some sources of dieting and health advice say frequent eating in small doses revs up the metabolism and controls hunger, and is a healthier way of eating than three big meals. Duffey said what matters is what and how much you eat over the course of the day rather than how often you eat. “Don’t eat seven times a day if what you’re eating is a salty snack or a pizza,” she said. “If you’re going to do that, reach for an apple instead.”",true,"Americans may be cutting back on super-sized meals, but waistlines continue to expand from more frequent eating, according to a study released on Wednesday.","A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. 

Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s.

The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine.

According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption.

The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

83,7054,Legal pot sales begin in Uruguay under landmark 2013 law.,"Customers sniffed pungent green buds and grinned as they showed off blue-and-white envelopes containing the plant, which is now available as part a 2013 measure that made Uruguay the first nation to legalize a pot market covering the entire chain from plants to purchase. Santiago Pinatares, a 35-year-old construction worker, braved freezing temperatures in the capital, Montevideo, as he waited outside one of the 16 pharmacies authorized to sell marijuana. He said he has been smoking pot since age 14 but had no choice but to buy on the black market until now. “To be able to buy it legally is a huge breakthrough,” he told The Associated Press. “Uruguay is at the forefront of the world on this.” Some customers declined to comment saying they didn’t want their families or employers to know they were buying marijuana. Authorities say nearly 5,000 people have registered as consumers allowing them to buy up to 40 grams per month using fingerprint recognition. About two-thirds of them live in Montevideo. The price is set at the equivalent of $1.30 per gram, with 90 cents of that going to the two businesses chosen to cultivate marijuana. The rest is split between the pharmacies and the government, which will use its share to fund prevention programs. The marijuana comes in packages emblazoned with a seal of authenticity and warnings about the drug’s effects. Uruguay became the first country to regulate a national marijuana marketplace in an effort to fight rising homicide and crime rates associated with drug trafficking. The law also lets licensed individuals grow marijuana plants and form clubs. The country’s marijuana plan was widely applauded globally and seen as going beyond marijuana legislation in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington, but polls showed that most Uruguayans opposed it. Most of the country’s estimated 1,200 pharmacies also decided not to register to sell, stoking a debate over how the drug should be distributed. Experts attributed delays in the implementation of the pioneering plan to the fact that no other country had attempted such an ambitious endeavor. “There was a lot of hard work to finally come to this day,” Drug czar Diego Olivera said. “It is a challenging and complex project, and today we have taken a step forward.”",true,Marijuana aficionados lined up at pharmacies across Uruguay on Wednesday to be among the first in the South American nation to legally buy pot as a law regulating its sale took full effect.,"Customers in Uruguay are now able to legally purchase marijuana from authorized pharmacies, thanks to a 2013 law that made Uruguay the first country to legalize a pot market covering the entire chain from plants to purchase.

84,4252,Judge tosses $417M award against Johnson & Johnson.,"Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Maren Nelson granted the company’s request for a new trial, saying there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial that ended with the award two months ago. Nelson also ruled that there wasn’t convincing evidence that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice and the award for damages was excessive. The decision will be appealed even though Eva Echeverria has died, said her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr. “We will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product,” he said in a statement. Echeverria alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about talcum powder’s potential cancer risks. She used the company’s baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007, according to court papers. Echeverria developed ovarian cancer as a “proximate result of the unreasonably dangerous and defective nature of talcum powder,” she said in her lawsuit. Her attorney contended that documents showed that Johnson & Johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer for three decades. The company said it was pleased with the ruling. “Ovarian cancer is a devastating disease — but it is not caused by the cosmetic-grade talc we have used in Johnson’s Baby Powder for decades. The science is clear and we will continue to defend the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder as we prepare for additional trials in the U.S.,” spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said in a statement. Similar allegations have led to hundreds of lawsuits against the New Jersey-based company. Jury awards have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars. However, on Tuesday a Missouri appellate court threw out a $72 million award to the family of an Alabama woman who has died, ruling that the state wasn’t the proper jurisdiction for such a case.

The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision.

The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate.

The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries.

85,31114,Justin Bieber and Katy Perry made public statements warning that the music industry is run by pedophiles.,"In early August 2017, articles appeared on unreliable web sites reporting that two of the most popular entertainers in pop music, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, had made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles. (Note: We recognize that pedophilia, which is defined as a sexual attraction to children, is not the same as child sexual abuse, although the web sites under discussion do not observe that distinction.) A YourNewsWire story written by Dmitry Baxter (one of the promulgators of the thoroughly discredited “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory claiming in 2016 that Hillary Clinton and other “Washington elites” ran a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant in the nation’s capitol) intimated that the reason Bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour in July was his realization that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business: Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people — pedophiles.” Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour. Describing a party on tour — attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers — Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite. One day later, a similar article about Katy Perry was posted on the web site Neon Nettle (another hardcore purveyor of “Pizzagate” rumors, not to mention articles falsely attributing statements about show business pedophilia to actor Brad Pitt and implying connections between the deaths of alt-rockers Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington and music industry child abusers): In a shocking exposé from one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Katy Perry has dealt a devastating blow to the entertainment world elite by revealing that the entire industry is “controlled” by “sick pedophiles”. The “I Kissed a Girl” singer had left many concerned about her mental state following a series of public breakdowns earlier this year. She made headlines when she disclosed her suicidal tendencies and exhibited signs of a split personality disorder, saying “I don’t want to be Katy Perry anymore”. The article goes on to paint a picture virtually identical to that in the YourNewsWire article of industry pedophiles making up an “exclusive club”: Clearly troubled by the details, she told a group of close friends: “I can’t live this life any longer. They’re all pedophiles. What they do to these children is sick.” She continues to elaborate, visibly traumatized by the things she’s witnessed: “And they’re every where you go. It’s like they’re not even trying to hide it. They flaunt it like it’s a badge of honor” “The producers, the executives, the big names… They’re all in on it” “It’s like an exclusive club that you can only join if you do these evil things to innocent children… And it’s not just dirty old men, it’s all of them. Even the women.” “They say to me, ‘Katy, you need to take the next step in your career’, but there’s no way I would do those things to kids.” Despite the fact that both stories include elements of truth to shore up their credibility — Justin Bieber did cancel part of his 2017 tour, for example, and Katy Perry did say in a live-streamed therapy session that she doesn’t want to be “Katy Perry” anymore (i.e., in the sense of having to live up to fans’ expectations) — in neither case are the statements attributed to them about pedophilia sufficiently sourced or corroborated to earn readers’ credence. No such statements by Bieber and Perry have been quoted (or even mentioned) by any mainstream news outlets. On the contrary, these statements are lurid fabrications designed either to garner social media likes and shares (and advertising dollars), or spread disinformation intended to harm the reputations of so-called “Hollywood elites” (a favorite political target of both YourNewsWire and Neon Nettle), or both. Unfortunately, by disseminating these false stories, the web sites dilute and lend confusion to the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by the likes of former child actors Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood, who have separately gone on record saying the extent to which the sexual abuse of minors occurs in Hollywood is underreported. Worse, child abuse is one of those emotion-laden topics that can lead to violence, so there’s no room for false reporting. One would hope that lessons were learned from the Pizzagate debacle, which resulted in a credulous fake news reader firing an AR-15 rifle inside Washington DC’s Comet Ping Pong, a family restaurant; the shooter said he expected to rescue “child sex slaves” from a pedophile ring that does not exist, which was purportedly run out of the restaurant’s basement, which also does not exist.",false,"We reached out to representatives of Justin Bieber and Kate Perry for comment, but did not hear back before publication time.","The claim that Justin Bieber and Katy Perry made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles is not supported by credible sources.

86,2037,Quake amputees embody resilience in broken Haiti.,"A member of an amputee soccer team hits the ball during a training session for an upcoming exhibition match in Port-au-Prince January 8, 2011. REUTERS/Kena Betancur Playing a weekend warm-up match days before the anniversary of the devastating January 12 quake, the players control the ball artfully with their good legs, avoiding “illegal” contact with their crutches. The teams train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti’s largest slum on the outskirts of the wrecked capital Port-au-Prince. They faced off again on Monday in the National Stadium as part of a low-key yet poignant commemoration of the disaster that killed around a quarter of a million people. “Everything can’t get fixed after the earthquake but life goes on,” said Mackendy Francois, whose friends used a hacksaw to cut off his left leg below the knee when they freed him from the rubble of a shirt factory a year ago. Thousands of people lost limbs in the earthquake, which left more than 1 million Haitians homeless and living in misery in the already poor, calamity-prone Caribbean nation. “Life didn’t end when I lost a leg,” Francois, 23, told Reuters. He said he felt proud to represent his team against opposing side Zaryen, named after the Haitian Creole term for a tarantula because of the way the hardy spider keeps on going even after it loses a leg. The players got treatment, athletic training and prosthetic limbs thanks to a joint effort by Miami’s Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus, which committed more than $1 million to the prosthetics and therapy program. More than 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs in the program so far and hundreds more will begin treatment in the coming weeks and months, Knights of Columbus Senior Vice President Patrick Korten told Reuters in an email. The soccer teams include some players disabled by birth defects and amputees from accidents unrelated to the quake. Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, initial hopes that a new, more successful Haiti could somehow rise from the rubble with international help are becoming clouded by a sense of pessimism and despair. Even before the quake, about 70 percent of the 10 million people in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest state, lived on less than $2 a day. Conditions for many now seem worse. Zaryen midfielder Bernard Noubert, who lost both his parents in the quake in the same building where he lost a leg, said soccer has helped keep him going. “It’s the best distraction for me to lighten my heart,” he said. LOW-PROFILE COMMEMORATION Despite billions of dollars in pledged aid and a generous outpouring of world solidarity for Haiti after the quake, the anniversary promises little in the way of celebration. That may be due to a steady drumbeat of criticism from many quarters about how little has been achieved so far in trying to rebuild the capital city. Major streets in Port-au-Prince have been mostly cleared of rubble and tent cities that once held more than 1.3 million people made homeless by the quake have slowly started to thin out. But debris still covers vast tracts of the capital and bodies are still being pulled from collapsed buildings. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, the U.N. special envoy to Haiti who heads a reconstruction commission with outgoing Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, has also faced criticism over the lack of tangible results. Clinton is expected back in Port-au-Prince this week and is likely to call for patience in the grueling rebuilding task. Commemoration events this week include a ceremony on Tuesday marking the reopening of Port-au-Prince’s restored Iron Market, a cultural and architectural landmark in the city’s downtown area. Built by the French in the late 19th Century, the market with its ornate clock tower was badly damaged in the quake after a fire in 2008. Its restoration was funded by Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel, Haiti’s largest private investor. But such schemes are of little interest to Anise Sainee, a 54-year-old grandmother who lives with her husband and 11 children and grandchildren in a tent in a crowded camp in front of the wrecked presidential palace. She holds little hopes for a better future. “I can only count on God,” she said. A strong stench drifted from nearby latrines and from a sewer in front of Sainee’s tent, with its corrugated tin roof and dirty plastic sheeting stamped with the words “U.S. Aid from the American People.” “I’ve seen no government here. There is no government,” Sainee said. “I’ve seen no progress either. It seems like the situation just gets worse.” Nine months after the quake, a cholera epidemic hit Haiti and has since killed more than 3,600 people. Even the November 28 presidential and legislative elections failed to give greater credibility to the government, with the outcome of the vote mired in uncertainty after widespread fraud allegations and sporadic street violence. Screeds of Creole graffiti on Port-au-Prince’s walls chronicle Haiti’s chaotic politics. One reads “Aba Okipasyon (Down With the Occupation)” but it is not clear if it refers to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Haiti, the reconstruction commission co-chaired by Clinton or the army of foreigners involved in Haiti’s reconstruction. Given this instability, it is not surprising that some Haitians hark back with nostalgia to the rule of Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, who from 1971 continued the rule of his late despotic father Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier. Sainee’s 62-year-old husband, Fedor Cine, lost his job as a street sweeper four years ago and is one of those who believes things were better in the Duvalier era. “He was a real president,” Cine said of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who lives in France after being ousted by a popular uprising in 1986 — a rebellion that began Haiti’s still ongoing experiment with democracy.",true,"Sprinting on their crutches at breakneck speed, the young soccer players who lost legs in Haiti’s earthquake last year project a symbol of hope and resilience in a land where so much is broken.","The article discusses the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti, who have lost limbs as a result of the devastating earthquake that struck the country in 2010.

Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, there is a sense of pessimism and despair in Haiti. The country was already impoverished before the earthquake, with 70% of the population living on less than $2 a day. The rebuilding efforts have been slow, and major streets in the capital city of Port-au-Prince are still covered in debris.

The anniversary of the earthquake promises little in the way of celebration, with many people expressing disappointment in the lack of progress.

The article also mentions the reopening of Port-au-Prince's restored Iron Market as part of the commemoration events. The market, a cultural and architectural landmark, was badly damaged in the earthquake and has been restored with funding from Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel. However, for many Haitians living in crowded camps, such projects hold little interest. The country has also faced other challenges, including a cholera epidemic and a controversial presidential election.

The article ends by mentioning the nostalgia some Haitians have for the rule of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, who continued the rule of his father Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier. Despite the ongoing experiment with democracy in Haiti, some people believe that things were better under the Duvalier regime.

87,3724,Players’ mental health becoming major issue in cricket.,"Veteran allrounder Glenn Maxwell and ex-test batman Nic Maddinson made themselves unavailable for the series against Pakistan before 21-year-old Will Pucovksi informed selectors that he didn’t want to be considered for national duties. Pucovski was playing in an Australia A tour game against Pakistan in Perth when he made the call, and the decision was announced Thursday, hours before Australia’s chairman of selectors, Trevor Hohns, was due to announce the test squad. The mental health issue isn’t isolated or, seemingly, new in cricket. Senior England batsmen have left tours going back more than a decade because of mental health issues. And India captain Virat Kohli spoke openly this week about his own struggles. Kohli is one of the world’s premier batsmen and respected leaders, and is involved in a home series against Bangladesh. “I’ve gone through a phase in my career where I felt like it was the end of the world,” he told a news conference in India. “In England 2014, I didn’t know what to do, what to say to anyone, and how to speak and how to communicate. And to be honest, I couldn’t have said ‘I’m not feeling great mentally and I need to get away from the game.’ Because you never know how that’s taken.” That kind of statement is being taken seriously by the sport’s administrators now. Cricket Australia national teams manager Ben Oliver commended Pucovski “for having the courage to discuss his situation.” “Will’s decision not to nominate for test selection was the right one in the circumstances,” Oliver said. “By Will bravely taking this position, he will undoubtedly inspire others facing similar challenges to speak up and take positive steps toward improving their mental well-being. “The most important thing now is for Will to be given the time, space and expert support that he needs to return to full health as soon as possible.” The 31-year-old Maxwell, who has played seven tests, 110 one-day internationals and 61 Twenty20 internationals, has been in and out of the Australian team throughout his career. He withdrew from selection during a series against Sri Lanka last month. Maddinson, who was rushed into the Australian team against South Africa in 2016, has played three tests but didn’t appear comfortable at the highest level of the game. He ruled himself out of national selection not long after Maxwell’s announcement last month. Pucovski played the first of his 18 first-class games in 2017. He has a high-score of 243 and a first-class average of almost 41. He was set for a test debut in January but withdrew, citing mental health issues. He was back in calculations for this southern summer before making the same call. Cricket Australia’s sports medicine manager, Alex Kountouris, said player welfare was paramount. “There is much society still needs to learn in relation to mental health, but we know enough to say with great certainty that silence is not the answer,” Kountouris said. “Will has demonstrated great strength in being open about his situation. While no one wants to see a fine young man like Will confronting mental well-being issues, we are heartened by the fact he is surrounded by excellent people who will support him.” Kohli described the example set by Maxwell as “remarkable.” “He set the right example for cricketers all over the world — that if you’re not in the best frame of mind, you try and try and try, but as human beings you reach a tipping point and you need time away from the game,” Kolhi said. “These things should be respected and not taken in a negative way. “This is happening on a human level, it’s got nothing to do with what you do on the field. It’s not having the capacity anymore to deal with (everything), which I think can happen to any person in any walk of life.” Ex-England captain Marcus Trescothick quit a tour of India in 2006, initially cited a viral problem, but later said it was related to mental health. “I didn’t have a clue what was happening. I wasn’t aware of depression but whatever was going on, I didn’t want to have to say anything about it on TV,” Trescothick told Men’s Health magazine in 2016. “I was terrified. “There was a lot of naivety and ignorance. People would say ‘What do you have to be depressed about? You play cricket for England. You travel the world. You get paid well.’ To try and experience the dark place when you’ve never experienced it is very tough.” England opener Jonathan Trott left an Ashes series in Australia after one test in 2013, saying later he’d struggled in the previous series and didn’t know how to cope. So-called mental toughness has long been a part of cricket, where sledging — often nasty banter between players — was a fundamental part of the game. That has been changing over the last decade. Cricket Australia has had a full-time sports psychologist working with national teams and player development squads. Robert Craddock, a long-time cricket analysist and television host in Australia, said cricket was facing a mental health crisis. He said while it may not be a contact sport “its mental challenges, with so much waiting time, are much tougher than they look.” “Even though cricket is only starting to go public with its mental issues, it has always been a supremely demanding mental game,” Craddock wrote in a column for News Corp. “The victory of the current crisis is that at least players are talking. “If the current issues have taught us anything it is that success and failure can sometimes have little to do with it, and that the causes of the anguish are many and varied.” ___ More AP sports: and",true,A serious health concern is emerging in Australian cricket. The first test of the home summer starts in Brisbane next week and Australia has three players out of the selection frame because of mental health reasons.,"The article discusses the growing issue of mental health among cricket players. It highlights recent cases where players have made themselves unavailable for selection due to mental health concerns. Veteran allrounder Glenn Maxwell and ex-test batsman Nic Maddinson both withdrew from the series against Pakistan, while 21-year-old Will Pucovski informed selectors that he didn't want to be considered for national duties.

The article mentions that mental health issues are not isolated to cricket, with senior England batsmen and India captain Virat Kohli also speaking openly about their struggles.

Cricket Australia's national teams manager, Ben Oliver, commended Pucovski for his courage in discussing his situation and emphasized the importance of supporting players facing similar challenges. The article also mentions that player welfare is paramount, and silence is not the answer when it comes to mental health. Cricket Australia's sports medicine manager, Alex Kountouris, stated that there is still much society needs to learn about mental health, but it is clear that openness and support are crucial.

The article also highlights the cases of other cricketers who have struggled with mental health issues, such as ex-England captain Marcus Trescothick and England opener Jonathan Trott. It notes that cricket has traditionally placed a strong emphasis on mental toughness, but the sport is now recognizing the importance of addressing mental health concerns.

Overall, the article emphasizes the need for greater awareness and support for mental health in cricket. It commends players like Maxwell and Pucovski for speaking out and setting an example for others. The article concludes by stating that cricket is facing a mental health crisis and that the causes of mental anguish in the sport are many and varied.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The June 13, 2013, post by the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, which also has a web page highlighting political items, was accompanied by a message signed ""Veruca"": ""True. Google it."" Referring to the Republican governor’s possibly renewed presidential aspirations, the comment closed: ""Just think if he makes good on his threat to run again, he can do for the whole country what he's done for Texas."" Mindful that we’ve previously explored claims about each of these topics, we asked the Everlasting GOP Stoppers, whose posts play off of the novel and movie ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" how it reached its Texas rankings. Worker deaths ""Veruca Salt"" (who did not provide her real name), a co-founder of the group, replied via Facebook message and pointed out an April 1, 2013, commentary by a state legislator, a Sept. 15, 2012, Dallas Morning News news article and a Sept. 21, 2011, news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, each of them indicating that in 2010, Texas was tops in some kind of worker fatalities. The commentary by Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, said: ""Texas still leads the country in the rate of construction worker fatalities."" The Sept. 15, 2012, News’ story said that Texas led the nation with 461 total worker deaths in 2010, a tally attributed to the bureau, whose news release said Texas had 456 ""fatal work injuries"" in 2010, according to a preliminary count, which was down 26 from 2009. Some 134 of the deaths were highway-related, according to the release, with workplace homicides and falls accounting for 48 and 45 deaths, respectively. The release does not say Texas led the nation in workplace deaths. In May 2013, we rated a claim that Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents. Drawing on statistics compiled by the federal bureau, we found that according to preliminary figures for 2011, Texas ranked No. 1 in five of six types of event or exposure tabbed by Austin advocate Jim Marston as ""industrial accident categories"" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. Texas, the nation’s second-most populous state, had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. California had the second-most in each of the four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. Seeking a way to account for population differences among states, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the bureau. Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the ""worst"" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. ""Worst"" among the states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). ""Worst"" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). During our look into the Everlasting GOP Stoppers’ claim, a bureau spokeswoman, Cheryl Abbot, responded to our inquiry about worker deaths in general by emailing us a federal document showing 2011 workplace fatality rates state by state. That year, according to the document, Texas had a rate of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers. That tied the state for 22nd with Alabama. North Dakota ranked first with a fatality rate of 12.4, according to the document, with Wyoming second (11.6) followed by Montana (11.2), Alaska (11.1), Arkansas (8.0), South Dakota (6.7) and New Mexico (6.6). Among the 10 most populous states, Texas ranked second to Ohio, which had a 5.5 fatality rate, according to the document. Carbon emissions ""Salt"" pointed us toward a May 14, 2013, blog post in a trade publication, Environmental Leader, stating: ""Texas still led the U.S. states in CO2 emissions from energy with 663 million metric tons in 2010, followed by California and Pennsylvania."" The post, like a May 29, 2013, online post by the Environmental Defense Fund, attributed the conclusion to figures posted by the federal Energy Information Administration. The post said too, however, that Wyoming had the nation’s greatest per-resident emissions, 118.5 metric tons per capita. In February 2013, we found a similar contrast; by far, Texas topped other states in carbon emissions except when those emissions were adjusted for population. A Jan. 12, 2012, Houston Chronicle news article said that according to federal data released that day, Texas was releasing far more greenhouse gases into the air than any other state. The story continued: ""Texas' coal-fired power plants and oil refineries generated 294 million tons of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in 2010, more than the next two states – Pennsylvania and Florida – combined, the data show."" The story said the Environmental Protection Agency released the data from the largest industrial sources across the country for the first time as part of a broader effort to reduce emissions linked to global warming. It said the agency ""collected data from more than 6,700 industrial facilities that release at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases into the air a year. The threshold is comparable to the emissions from burning 131 railcars of coal, the EPA said."" To our inquiries at that time, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Sierra Club in Texas each guided us to even more recent EPA data on industrial emissions of greenhouse gases, the primary driver of climate change, the federal agency says. And on the agency’s website, it’s possible to check on each state’s industrial emissions of eight gases, among them carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. According to the posted information, Texas industrial facilities in 2011 emitted 391 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels. The database indicates that industrial CO2 emissions in other populous states were lower: California (95 million metric tons); New York (44); Florida (123); Illinois (41); Pennsylvania (141): Ohio (142); Michigan (89); Georgia (82); North Carolina (66); and New Jersey (23). Louisiana, on the Gulf Coast like Texas, had 132 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, according to the agency. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that Texas plants make the state No. 1 in industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Neil Carman, who directs the Clean Air program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, told us by email: ""Realize that Texas has more large oil refineries, major chemical and petrochemical plants, hundreds of natural gas processing plants, Portland cement kilns, carbon black plants, etc. than any other state because of the strength of the oil & gas industry and the large geographical size and population base as well."" Carman’s comment underscored a hitch in the federal information. The data does not reflect total gases emitted in each state--just those attributed to industrial facilities. Yet Al Armendariz of the Sierra Club guided us to a spreadsheet prepared by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, based on its analysis of emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, estimating that in 2010, Texas had 653 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. California placed a distant second, at 370 million metric tons, and Pennsylvania was third, at 257 million metric tons. So, Texas has been No. 1 in total CO2 emissions, though it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population.In per-capita emissions, less populous states led the nation, topped by Wyoming (108 metric tons per capita); North Dakota (76); Alaska (56); Louisiana (50); Montana (36); Kentucky (35); Indiana (34); Iowa (30); Alabama and New Mexico (28); Nebraska and Oklahoma (27). Kansas and Texas each had 26 metric tons of CO2 emissions per resident. High school graduates On Texas ranking last in high school graduates, ""Salt"" cited the March 2013 edition of a report by a Texas House caucus, the Legislative Study Group, on how Texas ranks compared to other states. ""Texas is dead last in percentage of high school graduates,"" the report said, a conclusion attributed to the ""Texas Fact Book"" published in 2012 by the Legislative Budget Board, which said that in 2009, 79.9 percent of Texans had graduated from high school, placing the state 50th. By email, a staff spokesman for the budget board, John Barton, told us that ranking was based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey, which indicates Texas trailed Mississippi, at 80.4 percent, and California, 80.6 percent. More up-to-date information was available before the group made its post about Perry. In the bureau’s 2011 survey, Texas, Mississippi and California tied for last among the states, with 81.1 percent of adults having high school degrees. Louisiana was fourth, at 82.5 percent. We suppose the group’s Facebook post could be read as saying Texas is last in current high school graduation rates. That was not what we found in January 2013 when we rated a Perry claim that Texas graduation rates were at an all-time high and third-highest in the nation. Texas had tied with five states for the third-highest graduation rate in 2011, of 86 percent, we found. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Mental health spending ""Salt"" offered news articles and blog posts from 2011 and 2012 indicating Texas ranked 50th in per-resident spending on mental health care. Most drew on an annual analysis by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. In February 2013, we rated a claim that Texas is ""last in mental health expenditures,"" after noting that the foundation’s latest review indicated that another state spent less per resident than Texas in fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. The state’s per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. In raw dollars, then, Texas spent more on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after trailing all other states for several years. Our ruling The Facebook post said: ""Texas ranks: 1 in worker deaths, 1 carbon emissions, 50 in high school graduates, 50 in funding for mental health patients."" This post takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures, in each case stressing the result that makes Texas look worst. Still, two of the declared ranks seem fairly solid. Texas tied with Mississippi in 2011 for the greatest share of adults lacking high school degrees and it was second to last in per-person mental health spending in 2010. In contrast, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its 2011 worker fatality rate and while the state had the most carbon emissions in 2010, it would have tied for 13th if each state’s emissions were adjusted for its population.

The article examines each of these claims individually. 

Regarding worker deaths, the article cites various sources that indicate Texas had the highest number of worker fatalities in 2010. However, when adjusting for population, Texas ranked 18th in worker deaths per 100,000 workers. Among states with more than 1 million employed, Texas ranked 10th. 

In terms of carbon emissions, Texas did have the highest amount of CO2 emissions in 2010. However, when adjusting for population, Texas would have tied for 13th place. The article also notes that Texas has a large number of industrial facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants, which contribute to its high emissions.

Regarding high school graduates, the article states that Texas ranked last in percentage of high school graduates in 2009, with 79.9% of Texans having graduated from high school. However, more recent data from 2011 shows that Texas tied with Mississippi and California for last place, with 81.1% of adults having high school degrees.

In terms of funding for mental health patients, the article cites a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation that shows Texas ranked last in per-resident spending on mental health care in 2009, 2008, and 2007. However, in fiscal 2010, Texas ranked 49th in per-person spending, with Idaho being the only state with lower spending.

Overall, the article concludes that while two of the claims (high school graduates and mental health funding) are fairly solid, the claim takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures to make Texas look worse.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

90,8879,U.S. says UCB cough medicine overdose can kill.,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on Tuesday saying it had received reports that indicate doctors may be over prescribing the cough medicine made by UCB. Some people also are taking the medicine, Tussionex Pennkinetic Extended-Release Suspension. more frequently than every 12 hours, the recommended time interval, or giving it to children under age 6, the FDA said. Tussionex is not approved for children younger than 6 years old. The FDA said it had received numerous reports of health problems and deaths among children and adults who took Tussionex, which contains the narcotic pain reliever hydrocodone. Too much hydrocodone can cause life-threatening breathing problems. Five deaths have been reported among children under 6 who took Tussionex since its approval in 1987, company spokesman Eric Miller said on Friday. He said then that UCB has proposed a stronger warning for the medicine following the reports of the deaths. Miller said on Tuesday the number of deaths reported to the company for that age group remained at five. The FDA urged doctors and patients to follow prescribing instructions and to only use a medical syringe or other device designed to measure liquid medications. Household spoons vary in size and should not be used, the FDA said. “There is a real and serious risk for overdosing if this medication is not used according to the labeling,” Dr. Curtis Rosebraugh, acting director of the FDA office that regulates prescription cough medicines, said in a statement. UCB, based in Belgium, will update the Tussionex label to address the concerns, the FDA’s statement said. “The FDA’s alert is fully in line with our efforts to make sure this product is properly used,” a spokeswoman for UCB told Reuters, adding the company had already taken steps to clarify the label of the product in 2007. The spokeswoman said she could not see any reason why UCB would withdraw the product as the FDA alert only addressed an improper use of the medicine.

91,27876,The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.,"In July 2013, many in the online world became aware of the hazard posed by the giant hogweed via forwardings of the full text of a 2010 Toronto National Post article reporting that the toxic plant had just been discovered growing wild in eastern Ontario: Is it a fact that there is a plant called a giant Hogweed that its toxic properties are on all parts of the plant and touching it causes burns that turn into blisters? It has been reported on 3 e-mails I received today. The plant overtakes fields and grows to over 10 feet. The plant is supposed to be indigenous to Europe. It was reported in the e-mail that it is in South western Ontario, Canada and finding its way everywhere and the warning is to report it and never touch it. Its flowers resemble a giant Queen Anne’s Lace weed. Both the plant and the description of the effects of contact with its sap are real. Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) is an invasive herb in the carrot family which was originally brought to North America from Asia and has since become established in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, and Northwest regions of the United States. Giant hogweed grows along streams and rivers and in fields, forests, yards and roadsides, and a giant hogweed plant can reach 14 feet or more in height with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width. Giant hogweed sap contains toxic chemicals known as furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis, a reddening of the skin often followed by severe blistering and burns. These injuries can last for several months, and even after they have subsided the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. The sap can also cause temporary (or even permanent) blindness if introduced into the eyes. If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, the following steps should be taken: If a reaction occurs, the early application of topical steroids may lessen the severity of the reaction and ease the discomfort. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so applying sun block and keeping the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible are sensible precautions. Hogweed is far from the only dangerous plant one might expect to encounter. Others we’ve written about include oleander (a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways to provide decorative screening) and sago palm (a decorative shrub found in gardens and kept in pots within some homes).

92,8845,Repeat blood clots more common with stents: study.,"One in six patients who suffer a potentially deadly clot inside a coronary stent risk developing another clot, especially if they had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot, the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study said. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein, the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago. Stents are wire mesh tubes inserted into the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. They help keep the vessels from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. Clots that form inside a stent, also known as stent thrombosis, can block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack or even death. Use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis, the researchers said. Patients in the study who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for their first clot were 4.2 times as likely as other patients to endure another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times as likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times as likely to suffer a repeat episode. The study looked at 437 patients with various kinds of stents who had stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. It found 16.9 percent of the patients had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis — 61 patients had two episodes, 12 had three episodes and one had four episodes.",true,"Treating a stent-related blood clot with an additional stent in an emergency procedure sharply raises the risk that a patient will get a second clot and should be avoided, Dutch researchers said on Saturday.","A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot.

93,1688,Amazonian tribe study shows how human bodily bacteria is changing.,"A study published on Friday looking at the gut, mouth and skin microbes in people from a small, isolated tribe in southern Venezuela’s Amazonian jungles shows just how much modern life may be altering humankind’s bodily bacteria. The Yanomami villagers, secluded from the outside world until 2009, possessed the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in people including some never before detected in humans, said scientists whose research appears in the journal Science Advances. The researchers were surprised to learn the Yanomami’s microbes harbored antibiotic-resistant genes including those conferring resistance to manmade antibiotics, considering they never had exposure to commercial antibiotics. Every person hosts trillions of microbes, collectively called the microbiota, that live in and on virtually every part of the body. They contribute to functions essential to human health including immune system development, processing food and confronting invading pathogens. “Our study suggests that the pre-modern human microbiota was composed of a greater diversity of bacteria and a greater diversity of bacterial functions when compared to populations impacted by modern practices, such as processed foods and antibiotics,” said pathology and immunology professor Gautam Dantas of Washington University in St. Louis. A microbiota diversity decline may be linked to the increase in the past several decades of immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes and obesity, said Maria Dominguez-Bello, a professor of medicine at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 of the 54 Yanomami villagers. They were compared to a United States group, another Venezuelan Amazonian indigenous people, the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. Yanomami were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties of the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the others offer beneficial effects like protecting against kidney stones. The Yanomami are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers in their remote mountainous region. “It really is a unique opportunity to contact communities with this ancient lifestyle,” said Oscar Noya, a researcher with the Amazonic Center for Research and Control of Tropical Diseases in Venezuela who visited the villagers.",true,"Everyone’s body is brimming with bacteria, and these microbes do plenty of good things like building the immune system and helping digestion.

94,17569,Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average.,"Rhode Island was treated to an interesting do-the-ends-justify-the-means debate last week when the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine criticized a research study by Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University that uses young pigs to study the effects of alcohol consumption on the heart. Besides objecting to the treatment of the animals involved, the committee argued that the money spent on such research could be better used elsewhere in the Ocean State. To drive that point home, the committee has begun an advertising campaign with posters on five Providence bus shelters, claiming ""Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average. But Brown researchers are not helping teens. Instead, they are wasting federal funds on experiments giving alcohol to piglets."" We’ll pass on whether getting pigs drunk is a waste of federal money. But we wondered whether Rhode Island’s rate of teen binge drinking is that high. Two federal agencies that track teenage alcohol use, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, define binge drinking as having five or more drinks at the same occasion, at the same time or within a couple of hours. Physicians Committee spokeswoman Jeanne S. McVey said the group came up with its statistic by using data from two federal agencies that track, among other things, alcohol use by the nation’s teenagers. She cited a 2012 survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that found that 7.2 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 nationwide reported at least one instance of binge drinking over the previous 30 days. But that study didn’t break down its findings by state. For a Rhode Island number, McVey said, the committee turned to a 2013 survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Study, a survey of a cross section of the nation’s high school students, done every two years. According to documents posted on the state Health Department website, that survey found that in Rhode Island, 15.1 percent of responding students in grades 9 through 12 said they had at least one binge-drinking experience in the previous 30 days. Rhode Island’s 15.1 percent, as reported in the CDC study, is more than twice the national average of 7.2 percent, as reported in the SAMHSA study, McVey said. But those are numbers from two different studies. Is it legitimate to compare them in that way? No, said statistician Jeffrey E. Jarrett, a professor of finance decision science at the University of Rhode Island. To be valid, Jarrett said, comparisons must be drawn from the same data -- in other words, surveys that ask the same questions to the same people. Even a slight difference in wording between questionnaires can make a difference. ""The only way to compare is to compare things within the same study,"" he said. To get an apples-to-apples comparison, we returned to the CDC study. The agency has not yet compiled national averages for its 2013 study. But in its 2011 survey, the Rhode Island teen binge-drinking rate was 18.3 percent, compared with 21.9 percent for the nation as a whole. So the Rhode Island rate was actually less than the national one, not double. When we pointed out the flaws in the committee’s methodology, McVey acknowledged that the organization could have been more careful. ""We now see that we should have had an expert in statistics double check, because we were comparing one set of national statistics to one set of local statistics,"" McVey said. "" … If we were to do it over again, we would certainly word it differently."" ""Our larger point is true,"" she added. ""Federal funds should go to helping people rather than to animal experiments that often do not result in treatment for human patients."" Our ruling Regardless of your opinion on the larger point, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine sought to make it with an incorrect comparison. It claimed ""Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average,"" deriving that claim by comparing numbers from two different surveys.

Officials hope the programs will give students and farmers a chance to earn a new certificate in the subject. Officials have been planning for the new programs for years, said Karen Midden, interim dean of agricultural sciences. “We’re getting this request and input from stakeholders, who are reaching out to us, telling us they need the science,” Midden said. “But we’re also getting it from students — current and potential students — that they would like to have programs to prepare them for work in these areas.” In joining the growing number of colleges around the country to offer courses related to marijuana, Southern Illinois University’s interdisciplinary program in cannabis science will be a mixture of agriculture and plant biology with courses in subjects ranging from chemistry to business to engineering. “Both of these crops — hemp and medicinal cannabis — show benefits in numerous areas, all the way from health and quality of life to having another natural fiber that can be used in so many ways,” Midden said. “We want a program to support this emerging industry. They need the science we can provide, and we are positioning ourselves to help.” Southern Illinois University researchers already have approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to grow hemp. School leaders said they hope to begin planting in the spring on a 5-acre parcel of land, which will be split into a series of individual test plots to study specific research questions, such as the crops’ optimal growing conditions and environmental impact. Illinois has permitted the sale of medical marijuana since 2015, but only to patients with a few dozen documented conditions. Gov. Bruce Rauner signed legislation in August that expands access to medical cannabis and permits its use as a painkiller. Rauner also lifted a state ban on planting hemp.",true,Southern Illinois University is creating new programs for students who want to know more about marijuana.,"Southern Illinois University (SIU) has announced the creation of programs at its Carbondale campus to study medical marijuana and industrial hemp.

97,27017,"If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms.","Even amid a torrent of campaign ads during the waning days of the 2014 midterm election cycle, a new television ad in Colorado’s tight Senate race certainly stands out. It addresses a topic -- abortion and birth control -- that have recurred often in the campaign between incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and Republican Rep. Cory Gardner. But the imagery, and the claim, make the ad unusual. The ad shows footage of a young, partially dressed couple in a bed, with the man reaching for a condom on the night table. ""Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys!"" the narration says. ""If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms."" In bold type, the ad offers a visual saying, ""Gardner: Ban birth control."" The ad’s sponsors -- the abortion-rights groups NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado -- frame the ad as an ""edgy"" attempt to reach young voters. (The ad also makes claims about climate change, but we won’t address those in this fact-check.) How accurate is the claim about condoms? We have previously addressed claims on Gardner and birth control, but this one is slightly different, so we’ll take a closer look. First, here’s what the Gardner campaign said when we asked about the ad. ""Cory does not want to ban condoms,"" said campaign spokesman Alex Siciliano. ""In fact, he believes in increased access to contraceptives. He has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter."" So where does the ad get its evidence from? Past claims about Gardner and birth control have stemmed from his support of efforts to support ""personhood"" measures that would define life beginning at fertilization to the Colorado Constitution. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Gardner co-sponsored H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a ""personhood"" bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would ""implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person"" and ""declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being."" It goes on to say that "" 'human person' and 'human being' include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being."" Opponents of personhood legislation say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of person could make illegal several FDA-approved contraceptives, such as the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Anti-abortion groups successfully petitioned to get personhood measures on the Colorado ballot in 2008 and 2010. Both times it was rejected by more than 70 percent of voters. As we have noted in the past, we can’t predict how the courts would interpret personhood legislation or their impacts on forms of birth control that are currently legal. Though even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, a lot of legal ambiguity remains. Because no state has passed a personhood measure, we don’t know how it could impact specific types of contraceptives. As we’ve noted in past articles about the debate over personhood, some legal scholars and the medical community have cautioned that it could potentially impact access to birth control. Gardner’s critics may have a point that some forms of birth control could be outlawed if personhood measures became law -- but that shouldn’t affect condoms. That’s because condoms prevent sperm from reaching the egg in the first place. No fertilization ever takes place. In a further twist, Gardner made a major about-face during the 2014 campaign, saying he no longer supports the personhood movement, partly because he now thinks it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. ""The fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position,"" Gardner told The Denver Post. ""I've learned to listen. I don't get everything right the first time."" Gardner has also said that if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed, he wants to allow the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Udall’s campaign said he supports allowing over-the-counter sales of the pill as long as insurance companies are still mandated to cover it without any cost sharing. Finally, Gardner’s campaign notes that in 2007, he was one of five to cosponsor an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specified that ""nothing in this section shall prohibit the sale, use, prescription or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug or chemical."" This bill, his campaign said, demonstrates that Gardner is not anti-contraceptive. The ad’s sponsors didn’t get back to PolitiFact, but Doug Gordon, a spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado, told our friends at FactCheck.org that ""we're not saying he is banning condoms. We are saying if Gardner starts limiting other forms of birth control, you better stock up on condoms because there will be so much demand for them — since Gardner wants to ban other forms of birth control."" While an affiliated radio ad does make that argument, the television ad doesn’t say that. It seems much more plausible to us that viewers of the TV ad would assume that Gardner wants to ban birth control, period. Our ruling The ad claims that ""if Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms."" The most obvious interpretation of this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms -- something that’s based on an incorrect interpretation of the measures Gardner has supported in the past (and which he has since distanced himself from). Gardner says he doesn’t support banning condoms, and in any case, condoms would not be at issue under the personhood measure he once supported.

The Gardner campaign denies the claim made in the ad and states that Gardner does not want to ban condoms. They clarify that Gardner believes in increased access to contraceptives and has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter.

He has also expressed support for allowing the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription.

Gardner's campaign notes that he cosponsored an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specifically stated it would not prohibit the sale, use, prescription, or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug, or chemical.

98,16259,"Darrell Issa Says Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States ""with an elevated temperature.","How much airport Ebola screening is too much? That was the big question on the Sunday talk shows Oct. 26. Over the weekend, New York, New Jersey and Illinois upped their Ebola screening guidelines, quarantining anyone passing through John F. Kennedy, Newark and Chicago-O'Hare international airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they’re not showing symptoms. The guidelines surpass federal regulations and have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, arguing that they are unnecessary. JFK, Newark and O'Hare already have screening processes, along with three other American airports, (more on that later) and people who aren’t showing symptoms aren’t contagious, experts say. On CNN’s State of the Union, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said New York and New Jersey’s quarantine might be unnecessary. But that doesn’t change the fact that the country’s Ebola screening hasn’t been adequate so far -- it missed Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed in the United States, who died Oct. 8. ""We had Mr. Duncan come in (to the United States) with an elevated temperature. We weren’t checking it, and now we’re playing catch-up,"" Issa said. The New York and New Jersey guidelines were put in place after a doctor in New York City tested positive for the disease Oct. 23. He arrived in New York Oct. 17 from Guinea, where he had been treating Ebola patients, and had been checking his temperature twice a day. It doesn’t appear that this patient, Dr. Craig Spencer, was showing symptoms when he first arrived in the United States. But what about Duncan -- is Issa right in saying that he came to the United States with a fever (Issa's office did not respond to our request for comment.) Duncan’s fever On Sept. 20, when Duncan arrived at Dulles International Airport in Washington from Liberia (via Belgium), American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola. But Duncan went through screening Sept. 19 in Monrovia, Liberia, where he presented a temperature of 97.3 degrees -- so he didn’t have a fever when he boarded the plane -- according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials who reviewed Duncan’s airport screening record. (According to the National Institutes of Health, the normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and a fever starts at a body temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.) We (and Issa) can’t know with certainty if Duncan had acquired a fever by the time he arrived at Dulles. But he did not report falling ill until several days later, when he went to the hospital Sept. 25 with a 100.1 degree fever. It was during this first visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that Duncan wasn’t examined appropriately. The nurse documented that Duncan had a temperature of 100.1 degrees. It was only after a physician examined him that she included in his record that he had recently arrived from Africa. He was discharged early the next morning. He returned to the hospital Sept. 28 and died there about 10 days later. We should note that Liberian authorities said Duncan lied on the airport Ebola screening questionnaire by answering ""no"" to questions about whether he had contact with an Ebola patient or cared for one or touched the body of someone who had died of Ebola. It was found out later that Duncan helped carry 19-year-old Marthalene Williams into a taxi to go to the hospital. She was seven months pregnant and was turned away at the hospital due to lack of space in the Ebola ward. She died several hours later. It is unclear whether Duncan knew of her diagnosis. Airport screenings Airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been going on since at least August. According to the CDC, exit screening might look different in each country but the basic elements are the same. All travelers must have their temperature taken, answer a questionnaire about their health and exposure history and are visually assessed for signs of potential illness. Travelers who show symptoms or signs of exposure are separated and assessed further which ultimately determines whether they are allowed to travel. Screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada and now the United States. The first week of October -- the week Duncan died -- the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines to supplement the screening already taking place in West Africa airports. Travelers from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports now have to go through an Ebola screening process. After passport review, they will have their temperature taken and answer questions about possible exposure. If they show possible signs of Ebola or exposure, they will be passed on to a public health authority. If not, the traveler will receive information about self-monitoring for symptoms. The five international airports -- John F. Kennedy, Newark, O’Hare, Dulles and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson -- already handled 94 percent of arrivals from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. On Oct. 21, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson announced that all travelers coming to America from those three countries would have to go through the five designated American airports.

These guidelines require anyone passing through the airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they are not showing symptoms, to be quarantined. The article mentions that these guidelines have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, who argue that they are unnecessary. The article also mentions that JFK, Newark, and O'Hare airports already have screening processes in place, along with three other American airports. Experts say that people who are not showing symptoms of Ebola are not contagious.

The article then discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It states that Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia, Liberia, where he had been screened for Ebola. However, he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving in the United States. The article notes that it is unclear whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States, as American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola at that time.

The article also mentions that airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been taking place since at least August. These screenings involve taking travelers' temperatures, answering health questionnaires, and visually assessing them for signs of illness. The article states that screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada, and now the United States.

The article concludes by stating that the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines in early October for travelers from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports. These guidelines require travelers to go through an Ebola screening process, including temperature checks and questions about possible exposure. The article notes that even with these screening measures in place, it is possible that Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms.

Overall, the article provides information about the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports and discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, who was the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States and mentions the existing airport screenings in West Africa and other countries.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

99,25096,The legislation ... that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity.,"The central German city of Ruesselsheim, home to carmaker Opel, wants to build 1,300 electric car charging points by 2020, plans that would make it a frontrunner on the continent. It has advantages enjoyed by few in Europe, including a powerful local car industry player and wealthy national economy. In Germany itself the city has an edge, having won a government grant of 12.8 million euros ($14.4 million) to fund the rollout. Yet, even here, red tape, shortages of qualified staff and the requisite hardware are likely to delay the installation by around two years, local officials told Reuters. The project will also need more money, said the officials who are running up against the complexity of civil engineering, potential power grid overloads and unwieldy payment processes, illustrating some of the difficulties facing cities and nations across Europe. “We are not doing this for profit,” said Marianne Floersheimer, Ruesselsheim council’s mobility chief. “But we cannot afford to top up the government money.” The number of electric cars on German roads grew fivefold between 2015 and 2018, and have risen strongly across Europe. However the growth in electric cars is outpacing the charging infrastructure. The ratio of electric cars to each charging point in Europe deteriorated to 7.0 from 6.1 in the same period, consultants AlixPartners found, although Europe is still better equipped than the United States at 19.7 per car, and China’s 7.6. Some analysts say a lag in infrastructure could drag on sales as customers hold off until electric becomes a convenient option. Any logjam could prove a problem for carmakers which, faced with emissions penalties, are pumping tens of billions of euros into electric technology in an industry-wide charge. German champion Volkswagen, for example, aims for electric vehicles to account for about a quarter of its sales by 2025. Obstacles to electrification could also strain the European Union’s plan to become “carbon neutral” by 2050 to combat climate change. A quarter of climate-harming emissions come from transport and, within that, most from passenger cars. However some campaigners, including Transport & Environment, a group that promotes clean transport, say good progress is being made in rolling out charging points in many countries of western and northern Europe, although central and eastern Europe are further behind. They say limited infrastructure is not having a significant effect on Europe’s electric car sales, which still represent a fraction of the vehicle market, and the ratio of cars to points is within the EU recommendation of 10. Given most charging will be done at home, they add, a lack of off-street parking in some areas could deter drivers from switching to electric. Like other German cities, Ruesselsheim is under pressure to roll out charging stations as environmental activists have started suing those municipalities that fail to comply with EU-wide rules for nitrogen dioxide emissions. With just 67,000 people, it has only a few charging points at the moment, some way behind the likes of wealthy and populous Hamburg on about 880 and Berlin with some 780. It is however aiming to provide one charging point per 72 people, the highest level in Europe, with the help of carmaker Opel, which will build around half of the points, plus the technical know-how of the local RheinMain University. Opel is owned by France’s PSA Group. Ruesselsheim’s electric plan won one of the highest grants under the German transport ministry’s clean air program. But local officials described some of the complications in implementation. The installation of every charging point needs to be agreed with authorities such as those in charge of water, monument protection and civil engineering, for example. Charging equipment makers, meanwhile, have long lead times. “We are chasing the same charging points, employees and supply technology as all the other cities,” said city spokesman Asswin Zabel. Hooking up inner-city charging points on low voltage lines will be relatively easy although some local people may object, said Matthias Schweitzer, head of technology at the local utility, Stadtwerke Ruesselsheim. But laying 2 km of medium voltage lines and ordering new transformer substations could take up to nine months, he said. The university aims to accompany the rollout with storage facilities to absorb green power and offer supply on demand. But it must measure whether inverters, which turn alternating current power from the grid into direct current used by car batteries, cause too much stress on the network. “We must ensure there is no overload,” Schweitzer added. Yet more snags await: There is still a hodge-podge of charging and paying processes across the country as vendors are not in sync with each other, meaning Ruesselsheimers may encounter payment difficulties on longer journeys. “There is no obligation to provide free roaming. People have to carry around far too many different customer cards,” said Hanns Koenig of research firm Aurora, which has studied commercial car charging opportunities. Germany is doing relatively well in Europe in terms of public charging points, with 17,400 countrywide, according to data from energy industry association BDEW. That would roughly equate to a point for every five of its 83,000 electric cars, about 1 percent of the vehicles on its roads. To keep up with sales, BDEW says thousands more public charging points are needed in coming years, as well as hundreds of thousands of private points at homes and workplaces. However funding could be a central problem in Germany, as well as in Europe and beyond, particularly along motorways which do not fall under any particular municipality. Carmakers are largely pouring much of their money into the development of electric vehicles, while energy providers hesitate to take on responsibility for the rollout as long as car sales remain too low to provide a profitable customer base. In Germany, many of the roughly 1,500 local utility players simply cannot shoulder huge infrastructure costs, especially while commercial success is not assured. The situation could become a vicious circle, some industry experts say, since without a large number of charging stations, customers may be reluctant to make the leap to electric. “Today it is still largely unclear who will make the necessary investment in the charging infrastructure in cities, housing and along the motorways in the short term, and how these can refinance themselves in the medium and long term,” said Jens Haas, managing director automotive at AlixPartners. “This results in lasting scepticism among German car customers and, in turn, hesitant buying.”",true,"Carmakers and policymakers in Europe are staking their futures on a race to electric vehicles. But the vast charging network needed to sustain their vision is patchy, and it’s not clear who’ll pay for it.","The article discusses the challenges faced by the central German city of Ruesselsheim in its plan to build 1,300 electric car charging points by 2020.

It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.\n\nThe dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.\n\nThe article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.\nClaim: A Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property.\nThe claim veracity: false.\nUsing only the context provided, explain why the claim veracity is false.\n""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""What's true: Minnesota man Jay Nygard was jailed in October 2015 after being found in contempt of court for refusing to comply with an order to remove a concrete base from his property.

The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.\nClaim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.\nThe claim veracity: unproven.\nUsing only the context provided, explain why the claim veracity is unproven.\n""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We contacted police in Hickory, North Carolina, to determine whether they’re aware of any incidents at Walmart (or elsewhere) matching the example above.

The city has received a government grant of 12.8 million euros to fund the project, but officials anticipate delays due to red tape, shortages of qualified staff, and the complexity of civil engineering and power grid overloads. The article highlights the growing number of electric cars in Germany and Europe, but notes that the charging infrastructure is not keeping pace with the demand. This could potentially hinder sales and the European Union\'s plan to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2050. The lack of off-street parking in some areas is also mentioned as a deterrent for drivers to switch to electric cars. Ruesselsheim aims to provide one charging point per 72 people, the highest level in Europe, with the help of carmaker Opel and the local RheinMain University. However, the installation of each charging point requires approval from various authorities and charging equipment makers have long lead times. The article also mentions the complications of different charging and payment processes across the country, as well as the funding challenges faced by Germany and other countries in expanding the charging infrastructure. The reluctance of energy providers to invest in the infrastructure while car sales remain low is highlighted as a potential obstacle. Without a sufficient number of charging stations, customers may be hesitant to switch to electric cars, creating a vicious circle.
