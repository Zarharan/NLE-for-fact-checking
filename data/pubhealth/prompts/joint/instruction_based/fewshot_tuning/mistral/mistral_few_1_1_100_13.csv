0,12405,Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries.,"California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and candidate for governor in 2018, claimed on Twitter that ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot & killed than others in developed countries."" To support this claim, Newsom's campaign spokesman pointed to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine in 2016, which compared gun homicide rates in the United States to 22 other high-income countries. The study found that the rate of gun homicides in the United States was 25.2 times higher than in the other countries. When considering all types of gun deaths, including homicides, accidental shootings, and suicides, people in the United States were 10 times more likely to die from a gun-related death than those in the other countries. The co-authors of the study confirmed that Newsom's claim was accurate. They described the study as ""purely an academic study"" and stated that anyone who looks at the data would agree with Newsom's claim. However, another study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found a slightly lower gun homicide rate in the United States compared to the American Journal of Medicine study. This discrepancy was due to the inclusion of countries like Turkey and Chile, which have relatively high gun homicide rates, in the United Nations study but not in the American Journal of Medicine report. Overall, Newsom's claim is supported by the American Journal of Medicine study, which found that the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times higher than in other developed countries. However, the inclusion of additional information from the United Nations study would have provided a more complete picture of the gun homicide rate in the United States compared to other nations. Therefore, while Newsom's statement is accurate, it could benefit from clarification or additional information.",true,"Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently said ""Americans are 25x more likely to be shot and killed than others in developed countries."" Newsom’s spokesman pointed to a study in the American Journal of Medicine that backs up this very sad statistic. It found the gun homicide rate in the United States is about 25 times greater than in other high-income, industrialized countries such as Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada. A similar study by the United Nations found America had a slightly lower gun homicide rate but included countries such as Turkey and Chile with relatively high gun homicide rates not included in the American Journal of Medicine report. Their inclusion explains the slightly lower rate. Newsom’s claim is backed by what appears to be a valid study. But another report with credible findings shows the gun homicide rate is not quite as high compared to other nations as Newsom asserts. His statement could have used this additional information.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.
Claim: Egyptian masseur plays with fire to ease muscle pain.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: Democratic candidates Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and Joe Biden made appearances in Nevada to appeal to unions and Latino voters ahead of the state's caucuses. Klobuchar and Buttigieg, both Midwestern moderates, emphasized their opposition to ""Medicare for All"" proposals, arguing that such plans would cause Americans to lose their current health insurance. They specifically addressed Culinary Union workers, who value their robust health plans. Klobuchar expressed concern that the hard-fought plans of casino workers would be undermined by Medicare for All, while Buttigieg advocated for a government-run Medicare insurance option for those who choose it. Biden, who has maintained a lead in Nevada polls, held a town hall-style meeting with Latino and immigrant advocacy group Mi Familia Vota, where he promised a ""significant number of Latinos"" in his Cabinet and senior White House team. He acknowledged his understanding of being a second-class citizen, growing up Irish Catholic in a Scranton, Pennsylvania neighborhood. The Culinary Union, the largest immigrant organization in Nevada, has not yet announced its endorsement in the primary. The union's parent organization, Unite Here, will decide at the end of the month whether to endorse. If not, the Culinary Union may endorse independently. In December, Biden, Warren, and Sanders all made their pitches to the union, with Sanders facing heckling from some audience members when discussing his Medicare for All plan. Klobuchar and Buttigieg received less enthusiastic receptions compared to the better-known candidates. Buttigieg also held a town hall, drawing an enthusiastic audience of at least 700 people. One attendee, Sharon Sampsel, expressed support for Buttigieg, citing his ""winnable, stable, middle-of-the-road, commonsense platform.""

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced new rules for the food served in schools, claiming that the changes do not reduce nutritional standards. The article explains that while Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them. The starting point is that Washington's school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The standards included requirements for milk, whole grains, and sodium levels. Perdue's new rules give schools more time to comply with the standards for whole grains and sodium levels, and also expand the rules for milk. The article argues that while the standards themselves have not been changed, schools are now allowed to not follow them. The article compares this to saying that the posted speed limits on roads remain the same, but drivers can go as fast as they want. Perdue's office sent out a press release entitled ""Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again,"" which stated that the department would start the process to allow schools to serve 1 percent flavored milk. Schools can also apply for exemptions to the whole grain-rich content rule through 2020, and any school meeting the first target for sodium levels would be considered in compliance through 2020. The article concludes that while the overall goals for whole grains and sodium levels remain, the new policy extends the timeline for achieving those standards. The situation with milk is a little trickier, as the 2012 rules stated that flavored milk had to be non-fat. Perdue has not officially changed this yet, but he plans to do so. In summary, while Perdue claims that the changes to school lunch regulations do not reduce nutritional standards, the article argues that the standards are not being enforced and schools are allowed to not follow them. The article rates Perdue's claim as false.
Claim: Easing school lunch regulations ""is not reducing the nutritional standards whatsoever.

However, on that same date, a user with the pseudonym ""David Attenborough"" commented on an article on the Iranian news website PressTV. The comment made similar accusations against Israel, using the same language as the alleged quotation. This indicates that the 2014 PressTV article was the original source of the quotation.

Furthermore, the meme falsely described Attenborough as a member of parliament (MP), which further undermines its credibility. Attenborough did not make these statements about Israel.

In conclusion, the claim that David Attenborough compared Israeli people to animals and made derogatory remarks about their treatment of Palestinians is false. The alleged quotation originated from a comment made by an unknown person using the name ""David Attenborough"" on an Iranian news website. The inclusion of a specific date was likely an attempt to add authenticity to the statement, but it has been determined to be false.

5,6252,State agency says Ohio suicide deaths rose 45% since 2007.,"According to a report from the Ohio Department of Health, suicide deaths in Ohio have increased by 45% since 2007. The report also highlights a significant increase in suicide rates among young people between the ages of 10 and 24, with a 56% increase in the number of suicides and a 64% increase in the rate from 2007 to 2018. Suicide is now the leading cause of death for Ohio residents ages 10 to 14 and the second leading cause of death for residents ages 15 to 34. The report also reveals that the suicide rate for people aged 65 and older increased by nearly 48% between 2007 and 2018. Additionally, it states that white, non-Hispanic males have the highest suicide rate, while the suicide rate among black non-Hispanic males increased by 54% from 2014 to 2018. In response to the report, Republican Governor Mike DeWine highlighted his RecoveryOhio initiative, which aims to address mental illness and issues leading to suicide. He emphasized the importance of recognizing warning signs and taking steps to help those who are struggling. The report also provides some warning signs for people at risk of committing suicide, including major mood changes, poor grades in school, high-risk behaviors such as substance use, expressions of hopelessness, self-harm, and a personal or family history of depression.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects.

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

10,3260,WVa Senate forms committee dedicated to child welfare issues.,"The West Virginia Senate has formed the Senate Select Committee on Children and Families, which will be led by Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo. The committee's focus will be on addressing the state's foster care crisis and substance abuse epidemic. West Virginia currently has around 7,000 children in foster care due to the opioid crisis, and the state has the highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the nation. The committee was formed because legislation on child welfare issues would have had to compete with numerous other bills if they were channeled through other committees. The Department of Health and Human Resources' Child Protective Services (CPS) has been struggling to meet the required time frame for investigating child abuse and neglect allegations, with only 50% of cases being investigated within the required time frame in fiscal year 2018. CPS also faces high turnover, and caseloads for CPS workers have increased by 79% since 2015 due to the drug epidemic. Senate President Carmichael emphasized the importance of adequately providing for the needs of children and expressed hope that the committee would work towards finding solutions to ensure no child in West Virginia gets lost in a bureaucratic system. The committee consists of nine members, including physicians Tom Takubo and Ron Stollings, as well as Senate education chairwoman Patricia Rucker and former board of education chairman Paul Hardesty. The state is also facing a federal class-action lawsuit alleging that the foster care system has failed to protect children. The Department of Health and Human Resources Secretary Bill Crouch has been making changes to the system in response to the lawsuit.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The article discusses the claim made by Barack Obama that John McCain's health care plan includes drastic cuts to Medicare. Obama cites an analysis by the Center for American Progress Fund, which estimates that McCain's plan would cost the government $1.3 trillion over 10 years and would require a reduction of roughly 13 percent in Medicare spending growth, amounting to $882 billion in cuts. However, McCain's campaign has not mentioned any cuts to Medicare benefits or services. Instead, they propose achieving cost savings through overhauling reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, and expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs. McCain's senior policy adviser also suggests extending tax credits to low-income Americans to avoid enrolling in Medicaid. The article concludes that while it is unclear whether McCain's proposed methods would achieve the necessary savings, Obama is overstepping by repeating the analysis' conclusion and portraying the dollar amount of the cuts as part of McCain's plan.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses an attack ad called ""Cracks"" that was released by Lone Star First, an organization funded by the Democratic Governors Association, targeting Gov. Rick Perry. The ad claims that Perry supports injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with the controversial HPV vaccine without parental consent. The article examines the validity of this claim.

In 2007, Perry issued an executive order requiring Texas girls entering sixth grade to receive the HPV vaccine. Critics argued that the vaccine was too new to be declared safe and that the order infringed on parental rights. Lawmakers blocked the plans, and Perry's press secretary stated that the mandate was considered ""null and void.""

The article investigates whether Perry's move meant that children would receive the vaccine without parental consent. The Democratic Governors Association pointed to three news articles to support their claim, but none of them mentioned parental consent. The mandate included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine, and parents could request a conscientious objection affidavit form to enroll their children in public school without the required immunizations.

Spokespeople from the Health and Human Services Commission and the Department of State Health Services confirmed that vaccines cannot be given to children without the consent of a parent or legal guardian. Texas law specifies who can consent to a child's immunization, including guardians, authorized persons from another state or court, and secondary individuals if the primary ones are unavailable.

The article concludes that there is no evidence to support the claim that shots would have been given without parental consent. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed the fact that parents and guardians are the gatekeepers for children receiving vaccinations required for school attendance. The ad's statement preys on the fears of parents who objected to the vaccine and falsely implies that Perry endorsed forcing families to vaccinate their children against their will.

Overall, the article debunks the claim made in the attack ad and rates it as false.
Claim: Rick Perry thinks ""injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug (the HPV vaccine), without a parent's consent, is a good idea.

14,8518,Gaza resumes coronavirus testing amid shortages.,"Health officials in Gaza have resumed testing for the coronavirus after running out of testing kits earlier this month. The testing kits, which were donated by the World Health Organization (WHO), will be able to test approximately 500 people in the densely populated territory of two million. However, officials have stated that they are in need of thousands of testing kits to effectively carry out testing on a regular basis. Gaza currently has 13 confirmed cases of the virus, all of which are in quarantine. The shortage of testing kits in Gaza has raised concerns about the potential rapid spread of the virus in the territory. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for over a decade, which has limited the availability of medical supplies and equipment. However, Israeli and Palestinian officials have stated that Israel is cooperating with the international community to maintain public health in Gaza. In addition to the testing kits, Israel has allowed a PCR machine into the territory. This machine, donated by a U.S.-based charity, is used to analyze testing samples and determine if they contain the genetic fingerprint of the coronavirus. Health officials in Gaza are hopeful that they will be able to purchase a larger quantity of testing kits in the coming week. This is particularly important as hundreds of Palestinians stranded outside of Gaza are expected to return home and will require testing upon arrival. These individuals will then be sent to quarantine facilities in the southern Gaza Strip for three weeks. To prevent the spread of the virus, Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, has implemented several measures including the closure of schools, mosques, and wedding halls, as well as the banning of large street gatherings.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin).

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:

That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study on gene therapy that has shown promising results in curing adult leukemia. The study involved three patients, two of whom were in full remission and one in partial remission. However, the article criticizes the use of the term ""cure"" in the headline and throughout the story, as it is a loaded term that can create confusion. The article also highlights the importance of addressing the unknowns and uncertainties surrounding the treatment.

The article acknowledges that in a three-person study, it is difficult to quantify the harms or benefits beyond describing what happened to each patient. It praises the article from WebMD for presenting the side effects of the treatment and how they may have affected its effectiveness. The article also commends WebMD for evaluating the quality of the evidence and providing more qualifiers for the findings.

Both the WebMD article and the Reuters article could have used more outside sources, as they both only quoted one outside source. The article from WebMD was criticized for having an overly effusive outside source, while the Reuters article was praised for tempering some of the enthusiasm with a realistic assessment of the treatment's prospects.

The article also highlights an important comparison that the WebMD article made regarding bone marrow transplants. It states that a risky bone marrow transplant is required for a cure, but there is a 20% chance of not surviving the treatment and only a 50-50 chance of a cure even if the patient does survive.

The article explains that the gene therapy treatment involves genetically engineered cells called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which have been shown to kill cancer in the test tube but die away before doing much damage to tumors in humans. The addition of a special signaling molecule called 4-1BB in the current treatment has made the CAR T cells more potent and allowed them to persist and multiply in patients' bodies without causing harmful immune attacks.

Overall, the article praises the WebMD article for providing more information and context about the study, but criticizes both articles for relying heavily on patient quotes from a university news release.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:

That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Democrats in Maine legalized female genital mutilation is false. Female genital mutilation has been illegal across the United States since 1996. The article explains that the claim is based on a recent vote in the Maine legislature regarding a bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law in addition to the existing federal law. However, the Senate and the House of Representatives in Maine failed to agree on the text of the bill, and the measure died at the end of the session on April 18. The failure of the bill does not mean that Maine will now allow female genital mutilation.

The article mentions that the debate over the bill had been highly charged for months. The Southern Poverty Law Center published emails in February between a Republican representative and a group called ACT for America, which the SPLC has designated as a hate group. ACT for America claims to have helped pass female genital mutilation legislation in nine states, along with legislation banning Sharia Law and protecting those who report suspicious activity. The American Civil Liberties Union also weighed in on an early version of the bill, stating that it was an attempt to single out behavior attributed to certain religious and ethnic communities.

According to the women's advocacy group Equality Now, as of September 2017, 26 states had enacted legislation criminalizing female genital mutilation in addition to the federal ban. These state laws vary in terms of the age range they cover and the allowance for cultural defense.

In conclusion, the claim that Democrats in Maine legalized female genital mutilation is false. The bill that would have criminalized the practice under state law did not pass, and female genital mutilation remains illegal across the United States.
Claim: “Maine House Democrats Vote to Allow Female Genital Mutilation.”

19,2326,Poorer countries lack midwives to cut birth deaths: report.,"A review led by the United Nations Populations Fund and the World Health Organization has found that among 73 lower and middle-income nations, only four have adequate resources in place to provide necessary care for women and newborns. The four countries are Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Jordan. The review states that more than three-quarters of the countries face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, relieving pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding.

The four countries are Armenia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, and Jordan. The review states that more than three-quarters of the countries face serious shortages that will result in unnecessary deaths of women and babies. Midwives, who are trained to deliver babies and provide medical care before and after pregnancy, can provide most of the services needed for women and newborns, relieving pressure on doctors, especially in areas where medical resources are scarce or difficult to access. In 2013, there were an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths, 3 million newborn deaths, and 289,000 maternal deaths, with over 92 percent of these deaths occurring in the countries reviewed. Many of these countries lack the necessary infrastructure and regulatory systems to train midwives adequately. Data collection is also a problem. The report emphasizes the importance of women and girls' right to maternal and reproductive health and calls for a change in the current situation. The lack of midwifery services is not only a health crisis but also an economic one. Boosting midwifery services can reduce costly cesarean births, saving up to $128.5 million over three decades.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

21,29256,Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients.,"The claim that Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients is not entirely accurate. In 2016, the website Natural News published an article discussing a legal battle between the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) and PepsiCo. The CEH had raised concerns about the levels of a chemical called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products, which exceeded the legal limits imposed by California's Proposition 65. 4-MEI is a byproduct of the caramel coloring process used in soft drinks like cola. The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) released a study in 2007 suggesting that high doses of 4-MEI may cause lung cancer in mice and leukemia in rats. Based on this study, California added 4-MEI to its Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have different views on the potential cancer risk of 4-MEI. The EFSA found that the levels of 4-MEI Europeans were exposed to through food consumption were lower than those that would raise concerns. The FDA stated that there is no immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food. After 4-MEI was added to Proposition 65, the CEH found that some Pepsi and Coca-Cola products exceeded the allowable limits. Both companies announced their intent to reduce 4-MEI levels in their sodas to comply with California law. Subsequent testing showed that Pepsi had not changed their formulations outside of California, leading the CEH to continue their legal efforts against PepsiCo. In September 2015, PepsiCo and the CEH settled their dispute. Pepsi agreed to require its ingredient suppliers to meet strict limits on 4-MEI levels and to test its cola products to ensure compliance. However, the settlement did not require PepsiCo to admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The consent judgment explicitly stated that PepsiCo did not admit to violating any law or accepting 4-MEI's classification as a carcinogen.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The claim that Pepsi admitted that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients is not entirely accurate. In 2016, the website Natural News published an article discussing a legal battle between the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) and PepsiCo. The CEH had raised concerns about the levels of a chemical called 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI) in cola products, which exceeded the legal limits imposed by California's Proposition 65.

4-MEI is a byproduct of the caramel coloring process used in soft drinks like cola. The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) released a study in 2007 suggesting that high doses of 4-MEI may cause lung cancer in mice and leukemia in rats. Based on this study, California added 4-MEI to its Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.

However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have different views on the potential cancer risk of 4-MEI. The EFSA found that the levels of 4-MEI Europeans were exposed to through food consumption were lower than those that would raise concerns. The FDA stated that there is no immediate or short-term danger presented by 4-MEI at the levels expected in food.

After 4-MEI was added to Proposition 65, the CEH found that some Pepsi and Coca-Cola products exceeded the allowable limits. Both companies announced their intent to reduce 4-MEI levels in their sodas to comply with California law. Subsequent testing showed that Pepsi had not changed their formulations outside of California, leading the CEH to continue their legal efforts against PepsiCo.

In September 2015, PepsiCo and the CEH settled their dispute. Pepsi agreed to require its ingredient suppliers to meet strict limits on 4-MEI levels and to test its cola products to ensure compliance. However, the settlement did not require PepsiCo to admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The consent judgment explicitly stated that PepsiCo did not admit to violating any law or accepting 4-MEI's classification as a carcinogen.

In summary, while there were concerns about the levels of 4-MEI in Pepsi and Coca-Cola products, PepsiCo did not admit that their soda contains cancer-causing ingredients. The settlement between PepsiCo and the CEH focused on ensuring compliance with California's Proposition 65 regulations.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

23,949,"Biblical bad guys the ancient Philistines came from Europe, DNA shows.","Archaeologists in Israel have discovered genetic evidence that the ancient Philistines, often depicted as the enemies of the Israelites in Biblical texts, originated from Europe. The genetic findings were obtained from skeletons unearthed in 2016, including the bones of infants buried beneath Philistine houses. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, revealed that the Philistines immigrated to the region in the 12th century BC. The research team sent over 100 skeletal samples to Germany's Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, where DNA was found in ten individuals, particularly in the inner ear bones. The genetic modeling suggests that the ancestors of the Philistines came from southern Europe, and they likely traveled across the Mediterranean and arrived in Ashkelon, a coastal city in southern Israel and Gaza.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:

That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: Maulanasyah, a barber in Bogor, Indonesia, has taken extreme measures to protect himself and his customers from the coronavirus. He wears a plastic sheet held together with tape, a ski mask, a gas mask, and latex gloves while working at his salon. He has been wearing this protective gear for the past two weeks as a way to show appreciation to health workers and to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Before starting any haircuts, Maulanasyah sprays his protective gear and his customers' hands with sanitizer.

Indonesia has been heavily impacted by the coronavirus, with at least 240 deaths and nearly 3,000 infections. Health workers in the country have paid a high price, with 24 doctors dying from the disease and 130 medical workers in Jakarta being infected. In response, Jakarta has implemented measures such as closing businesses and schools and plans to enforce large-scale social restrictions with the help of security personnel.

Although Maulanasyah's salon is located outside of Jakarta, his income has significantly decreased from 500,000 rupiah ($31) per day to 100,000 rupiah ($6.20) due to the impact of the virus. Despite the cumbersome outfit he wears, customers like Abdul Rahman Fattah feel safer getting their hair cut at Maulanasyah's salon. However, Fattah acknowledges that the protective gear may affect the quality of the haircut.

To further protect himself and his family, Maulanasyah only allows four people in the salon at a time and encourages everyone to maintain a safe distance. He emphasizes the importance of ensuring his own safety at work since he does not know if his customers are infected or not.

Overall, Maulanasyah's extreme protective measures highlight the impact of the coronavirus on businesses and individuals in Indonesia. Despite the decrease in income, he prioritizes the safety of himself, his family, and his customers.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) officials are considering taking action against inoperable medical marijuana dispensaries in the state. However, a necessary rule is still being drafted and will not be ready by the end of January. The officials have stated that licenses may not be reissued when they come up for renewal in June. The amendment legalizing medical marijuana in Arkansas did not include an operation date for dispensaries, leaving the pace of development and opening of dispensaries up to the discretion of the owners. ABC Enforcement agents have been checking in with owners, requesting status updates and reminding them of their responsibility to serve patients. In early January, ABC will send a letter to each dispensary explaining the license renewal process and requesting an updated timeframe for opening. Currently, out of the 32 licensed dispensaries, only 11 are operating. This delay has frustrated marijuana commissioners who expected more dispensaries to be open by now. Some believe that out-of-state entities managing the unopened facilities are waiting for economic reasons. Attorney Alex Gray, who represents several dispensaries, explained that there are various factors that need to be considered before opening a dispensary, such as patient count, product supply, and the locations of other dispensaries. Gray emphasized that these decisions need to be made thoughtfully and deliberately.

27,10851,"New test can detect autism in children, scientists say","The article titled ""New test can detect autism in children, scientists say"" discusses a study that claims to have developed blood and urine tests that can detect autism in children. The study found a link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and damage to proteins in blood plasma. The most reliable test developed by the study examined protein in blood plasma and found that children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker 'dityrosine' (DT) and certain sugar-modified components called 'advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)'. However, the article does not provide actual data on the reliability of these tests. The study used a computer to analyze various biomarkers and found that the best diagnostic association was in children with ASD who had higher levels of DT and AGEs. The sensitivity of the model was 92 percent, meaning that 8 percent of children with ASD were missed by the model, and the specificity was 84 percent, meaning that 16 percent of children diagnosed with ASD did not actually have the condition. The article raises concerns about the potential harms of routine screening for autism using these tests. False positive results could lead parents to believe their child has ASD when they do not, while false negative results could offer false assurance that there is no ASD present. The article also highlights the limitations of the study, including the fact that it can only show an association between biomarkers and children already diagnosed with ASD, and it cannot prove that these biomarkers cause autism or predict its development. The article points out that there is no existing diagnostic test for autism and that diagnosis is based solely on behavioral observations and assessments. It also questions the novelty of the blood and urine tests, as the study does not prove that they can predict or diagnose autism.

This story jumps the gun by implying the results suggest these biomarkers cannot only “detect autism in children” but also “could lead to earlier diagnosis.” This speculative language appears to come directly from the lead author of the study who’s also quoted as saying “we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.” What would have helped this story considerably would be interviewing sources not affiliated with the study to clarify the limitations of these biomarkers, explain how ASD is currently diagnosed, and provide some much-needed context about the novelty, availability, and clinical relevance of the biomarkers studied. Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of problems with social communication and interaction, as well as behavioral issues that can be repetitive, compulsive, and/or disruptive in many social settings. The condition cannot be predicted or cured, so any news coverage about a potential screening method needs to be extremely cautious and pay special attention to the limitations of the study at hand, as well as include critique from independent sources.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

29,25853,“Florida is doing over five times better” than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people.,"The claim that Florida is doing over five times better than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people is misleading. While it is true that Florida's death rate is lower than that of New Jersey and New York, there are important factors to consider. According to an epidemiologist, the metric of COVID-19 deaths per million people is time-sensitive and difficult to interpret without proper context. The true denominator, which is the number of people infected, is unknown, and it is impossible to predict the future course of the outbreak. The Facebook post that made the claim cited data from Worldometer, which showed that Florida's death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey's and New York's. Other databases, including one from Johns Hopkins University, also confirmed this finding. However, this measure is limited because it only focuses on a state that became a hotspot after New York and New Jersey. News reports before the Facebook post highlighted Florida's record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases. The state had the highest single-day total of new cases and the highest weekly death total during the outbreak. A federal report also classified Florida as one of the 21 states in the ""red zone"" due to serious outbreaks. To provide a larger perspective, among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people. This statistic, according to Johns Hopkins University, places the US behind the United Kingdom, Peru, and Chile. Timing is a crucial factor in understanding the misleading nature of the claim. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, while Florida experienced its surge later. Experts argue that it is necessary to wait until the outbreak is over to accurately assess how well states have handled the situation. As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared to 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York. However, death counts and rates are lagging indicators and cannot predict the future course of the outbreak. In conclusion, while Florida does have a lower death rate than New Jersey and New York, it is misleading to claim that it is doing over five times better. The timing of the outbreaks and the lagging nature of death rates make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons.",false,"The claim is accurate on one measure — the number of COVID-19 deaths per capita for the duration of the outbreak.

The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The claim that Florida is doing over five times better than New Jersey and New York in COVID-19 deaths per million people is misleading. While it is true that Florida's death rate is lower than that of New Jersey and New York, there are important factors to consider.

According to an epidemiologist, the metric of COVID-19 deaths per million people is time-sensitive and difficult to interpret without proper context. The true denominator, which is the number of people infected, is unknown, and it is impossible to predict the future course of the outbreak.

The Facebook post that made the claim cited data from Worldometer, which showed that Florida's death rate was one-sixth of New Jersey's and New York's. Other databases, including one from Johns Hopkins University, also confirmed this finding. However, this measure is limited because it only focuses on a state that became a hotspot after New York and New Jersey.

News reports before the Facebook post highlighted Florida's record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases. The state had the highest single-day total of new cases and the highest weekly death total during the outbreak. A federal report also classified Florida as one of the 21 states in the ""red zone"" due to serious outbreaks.

To provide a larger perspective, among the 20 countries most affected by COVID-19, the United States has the fourth-highest death rate per 100,000 people. This statistic, according to Johns Hopkins University, places the US behind the United Kingdom, Peru, and Chile.

Timing is a crucial factor in understanding the misleading nature of the claim. New Jersey and New York were hit hard early in the pandemic, while Florida experienced its surge later. Experts argue that it is necessary to wait until the outbreak is over to accurately assess how well states have handled the situation.

As of July 30, Florida recorded 988 COVID-19 deaths in the previous seven days, compared to 91 in New Jersey and 114 in New York. However, death counts and rates are lagging indicators and cannot predict the future course of the outbreak.

In conclusion, while Florida does have a lower death rate than New Jersey and New York, it is misleading to claim that it is doing over five times better. The timing of the outbreaks and the lagging nature of death rates make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons.

30,2037,Quake amputees embody resilience in broken Haiti.,"The article discusses the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti, who have lost limbs as a result of the devastating earthquake that struck the country in 2010. The players, who train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti's largest slum, faced off in a match on the anniversary of the earthquake as a commemoration of the disaster. Many people in Haiti lost limbs in the earthquake, and the players have received treatment, athletic training, and prosthetic limbs through a program funded by Miami's Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus. Over 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs so far, with hundreds more set to begin treatment in the coming weeks and months.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The claim that black cats in Vietnam are being killed and consumed as a COVID-19 cure is not supported by evidence. Tabloid news sites, including the Toronto Sun, the New York Post, the U.S. Sun, and Vietnam Insider, published stories attributing this information to the South West News Service. However, the news service has removed the article from circulation due to concerns about its credibility.

On April 17, The Sun reported on an investigation by an animal rights group called Four Paws, which claimed that dog and cat meat sales were surging in Cambodia and Vietnam. The group suggested that doctors in the region were encouraging people to eat dog and cat meat, claiming it helps fight off viruses.

Subsequently, stories credited to the South West News Service were published, suggesting that black cats were being singled out, turned into paste, and consumed as medicine. However, the only source for these stories was the head of another charity, No to Dog Meat, based in London. When asked for evidence, the charity directed PolitiFact to their YouTube account, which included videos claiming to show cat mistreatment in Vietnam but lacked verifiable information.

Experts in Vietnam, including Cat Besch from Vietnam Animal Aid & Rescue, Nam Nguyen from Vietnam News Agency, Phuong Tham from Human Society International, and Dr. Todd Pollack from Harvard University, have seen no evidence to support the claim. While black cats are killed in Vietnam for superstitious beliefs or as a treatment for asthma in children, there is no evidence that they are being killed for COVID-19 treatment.

VN Express, a newspaper in Vietnam, reported that police seized dog and cat carcasses from a passenger bus, but there was no suggestion that the meat was being used for coronavirus treatment.

The South West News Service acknowledged issues with the story and pulled it from circulation. They received new information that cast doubt on the widespread nature of the claims made by the charity.

In conclusion, there is no evidence to support the claim that black cats in Vietnam are being killed and consumed as a COVID-19 cure.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: Tamla Horsford, a black woman, was found dead in the yard of a house where she attended an all-white adult sleepover on November 4, 2018. The circumstances surrounding her death have been contested, and her family believes that her death was covered up. The case was initially closed in 2019, but calls to reopen the investigation gained traction in June 2020. The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office requested the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to reopen the case. Horsford's friends and loved ones have expressed skepticism about the investigation, stating that the stories from others present at the party did not add up. They also questioned why certain evidence, such as Horsford's shoes and cigarette butts, were not collected and tested. A second autopsy was conducted privately, which found extensive injuries all over Horsford's body, leading to suspicions of foul play. The initial investigation concluded that Horsford's death was accidental and consistent with a fall. However, the family believes that the investigation was mishandled, with evidence being improperly handled and the scene not being preserved. The case gained attention on social media, with hashtags like #TamlaHorsford and #JusticeForTamlaHorsford calling for further investigation. Celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, also shared posts about the case. The viral image that circulated showed Horsford sitting among seven white women at the sleepover. The image was part of the initial reporting by a local news outlet. The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office released a statement in February 2020, stating that the case was closed and the cause of death was ruled as accidental. However, the recent calls for reopening the case have prompted the sheriff's office to request a new investigation.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:

What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a new treatment option for people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) called Lucentis. It mentions that Lucentis is a novel approach to treating wet AMD and was approved last June. However, it does not provide information on the availability of Lucentis or its cost, which is up to $2000 per injection. The cost is a significant barrier to obtaining the drug as it needs to be given monthly for an indefinite amount of time. The article does mention that Avastin is a cheaper alternative, but does not provide enough information on the cost of treatment. It also does not quantify the benefits of Lucentis treatment.

The article mentions that Lucentis carries an increased risk of strokes, but does not mention the risk of inflammation and infection from injection into the eye. It does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence for Lucentis. The article avoids disease mongering by not exaggerating the seriousness of wet AMD, but it should have provided some sense of the prevalence of wet AMD, which is relatively rare compared to dry AMD.

The article quotes one expert and one satisfied patient who happens to be a physician, but it should have quoted other clinicians/researchers for additional perspective. It mentions Avastin, laser treatment, and phototherapy as alternatives to Lucentis, but does not provide information on the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. It also fails to mention that Avastin is not approved for this indication.

Overall, the article does not provide enough information on the cost, benefits, risks, and availability of Lucentis. It could have provided more balanced information by including perspectives from other experts. The article does mention that Lucentis is a novel approach to treating wet AMD, but it is unclear if the story relies solely on a press release as the source of information.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain.

### Input:
Context: The article investigates the claim that the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period in spring 2020, resulting in decreased solar activity that could lead to famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather on Earth. The article explains that the sun's activity, including the number of sunspots and intensity of solar flares, fluctuates on an 11-year cycle known as the solar cycle. The cycle consists of a solar maximum phase, when sunspots increase, and a solar minimum phase, when sunspots decrease. As of May 2020, the sun was in a solar minimum phase, which confirmed one aspect of the claim.

During a solar minimum, the sun's activity changes form but does not become dull. There is a greater likelihood of long-lived coronal holes, which can cause space weather effects when they hit Earth's magnetic field. These effects include temporary disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere, auroras, and disruptions to communications and navigation systems. Additionally, during a solar minimum, the Earth's upper atmosphere cools, causing a decrease in drag and allowing space junk to accumulate.

However, the article emphasizes that the 2019-2020 solar minimum was not forecasted to have catastrophic effects. Scientists projected that the 25th sun cycle would likely be weak but similar to the previous cycle in terms of the number of sunspots. The article cites a solar scientist who states that the current solar minimum is not unprecedented and that previous deep solar minima did not cause famines, earthquakes, or other catastrophes. The scientist also notes that there is no evidence that the sun is ""stuck"" in a solar minimum, as sunspots have always reappeared after previous minima.

The concerns about the sun's activity originated from a report by the British tabloid newspaper, The Sun, which referred to the normal occurrence of a solar minimum as a ""lockdown"" without providing specific attribution.

In conclusion, while the sun was indeed in a solar minimum phase in spring 2020, there was no evidence to support the claim that this would lead to famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather on Earth. The solar minimum is a regular part of the sun's 11-year cycle, and previous deep solar minima did not result in catastrophic effects.
Claim: By spring 2020, the sun had entered a ""lockdown"" period where its solar activity decreased to the point that famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather threatened life on Earth.

40,11967,"Insurance companies ""have made a fortune with Obamacare.","President Donald Trump claimed that insurance companies ""have made a fortune with Obamacare."" However, an analysis of the insurance industry's profits shows that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did not contribute significantly to their earnings. While the top five for-profit insurance companies reported $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017, this cannot be directly attributed to Obamacare. The ACA exchanges, where people buy private insurance, make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. In fact, returns from the exchanges have been poor, leading three out of five of the companies mentioned to withdraw from the exchanges due to significant losses. The overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 helped balance out these losses for insurers who stayed in the exchanges. However, the ACA did have both positive and negative effects on insurance company profits. On the negative side, the ACA imposed limits on the spread between premiums collected and medical services paid out, which likely had a modest downward effect on profits. Additionally, a tax on insurance companies helped finance Obamacare. On the positive side, the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA led to underwriting gains for insurers. However, when considering the losses tied to the exchanges, regulations, and taxes on one hand, and the profits on Medicaid on the other, it is a wash for the insurance industry. The bulk of the insurance business lies in employer-based coverage, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the under-65 insurance market. Companies have benefited from shifting more costs onto customers through higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. Mergers in the industry have also contributed to higher margins. Medicare Advantage, a quasi-private version of traditional Medicare, has been a key profit center for insurers.

### Input:
Context: President Donald Trump claimed that insurance companies ""have made a fortune with Obamacare."" However, an analysis of the insurance industry's profits shows that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) did not contribute significantly to their earnings. While the top five for-profit insurance companies reported $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017, this cannot be directly attributed to Obamacare. The ACA exchanges, where people buy private insurance, make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. In fact, returns from the exchanges have been poor, leading three out of five of the companies mentioned to withdraw from the exchanges due to significant losses. The overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 helped balance out these losses for insurers who stayed in the exchanges. However, the ACA did have both positive and negative effects on insurance company profits. On the negative side, the ACA imposed limits on the spread between premiums collected and medical services paid out, which likely had a modest downward effect on profits. Additionally, a tax on insurance companies helped finance Obamacare. On the positive side, the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA led to underwriting gains for insurers. However, when considering the losses tied to the exchanges, regulations, and taxes on one hand, and the profits on Medicaid on the other, it is a wash for the insurance industry. The bulk of the insurance business lies in employer-based coverage, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the under-65 insurance market. Companies have benefited from shifting more costs onto customers through higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. Mergers in the industry have also contributed to higher margins. Medicare Advantage, a quasi-private version of traditional Medicare, has been a key profit center for insurers. Overall, the claim that insurance companies made a fortune with Obamacare is not accurate. The profits cited by the White House were not directly linked to the ACA, but rather came from other areas of the insurance market.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

It didn’t call this idea a treatment. It called it a “potential treatment.”  It’s not a treatment until it’s been shown to actually treat someone for something. It used the word “potential” three times in the story. Not applicable. No track record to discuss. The story highlighted some of the uncertainties. For example, it stated: and There was no disease-mongering in the story. No one truly independent of the Medtronic-Lilly partnership was quoted. We would have liked to have seen independent expert perspective on the approach. The story at least made brief references to other approaches in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. We would have liked more substance, but this was adequate given the context of the new announcement. The story makes it clear that the effort “is still many years from yielding a marketable treatment or even starting human testing…The drug may not enter human clinical trials for up to five years.” The story did an adequate and appropriate job of wrapping this approach into the context of other related research. It’s clear that the story didn’t rely solely on a news release.

43,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs.

The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs.

DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements.

Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs.

In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative. The DCYF expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs, indicating that his concern about the expenditure of taxpayer dollars is valid.

Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: Researchers have developed a device that uses a smartphone to detect infectious diseases more quickly. The device, called a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, is able to detect the presence of viruses and bacteria in a sample of bodily fluid. The researchers tested the device by comparing its results to those of a standard lab microscope, and found that it had a 99% accuracy rate. The device is also portable and easy to use, making it ideal for use in remote or resource-limited areas.

The cost of manufacturing the device is estimated to be less than $50, making it an affordable option for widespread use. However, the cost of infectious disease testing goes beyond just the cost of the device. Training is needed to accurately interpret the results, and it is unclear whether the device can replace conventional lab tests or if it would be used as a preliminary test. The device could potentially lead to more people getting tested, increasing the overall cost of testing programs.

The researchers claim that the device can provide more rapid and effective outbreak detection in the field. However, the device was only tested in an ideal laboratory setting and not in real-world conditions. The release does not mention the limitations of the study or the potential downsides of using the device.

The release also does not mention similar devices that are being tested at other institutions. It is unclear how this device compares to others in terms of effectiveness and cost.

Overall, the release makes speculative claims about the device's potential benefits without providing evidence from real-world testing. The researchers hope to move forward with clinical trials and commercialize the product.

48,37844,The Michigan secretary of state's office sent absentee ballots to 7.7 million people,"The article refutes the claim made by President Donald Trump that the Michigan secretary of state's office sent absentee ballots to 7.7 million people. The Michigan secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, clarified that they actually sent applications for absentee ballots, not the ballots themselves.

Receiving an application does not automatically mean a ballot will be issued; the application needs to be filled out and returned, and the recipient's signature must match their existing voter records to be issued a ballot.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

The release argues that this is a “gamechanger” and a “big step forward” that “is applicable to all diseases and all patients” — which are bold claims to make based on the treatment of only one patient. Unjustifiable language throughout and a lack of attention to key details like harms, cost and an explanation of the severe limitations of the research make this a weak and misleading release. There has been a lot of research focused on the use of AI to help diagnose cancers and develop treatment protocols — and it continues to be an area of great interest. However, it is difficult — if not impossible — to draw far-reaching conclusions from a single case. What costs, benefits and risks are associated with AI-directed treatment for cancers? A study like the one highlighted in this release simply cannot tell us. The release claims the researchers were able to improve treatment efficacy by adjusting treatment dose and presumably still minimizing adverse events. Again — impossible to prove based on a single patient. It is an interesting case study, and we look forward to learning the results of future research, but it is misleading (if not dishonest) to make sweeping claims based on the treatment of a single patient.","The article discusses the use of an AI platform called CURATE.AI to treat a metastatic cancer patient.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

50,8744,Both real and virtual colonoscopies work: report.,"A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that both real and virtual colonoscopies are equally effective in detecting precancerous polyps. The study, conducted by Dr. Daniel Johnson and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, involved performing both types of colonoscopies on 2,500 volunteers. The virtual colonoscopy, also known as CT colonography or CTC, uses an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner to detect polyps, while the real colonoscopy is done by gastroenterologists using a flexible lit tube passed through the bowel. The study found that the virtual colonoscopy detected 90% of precancerous polyps that were 10 millimeters or larger. While both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, the virtual colonoscopy does not require sedation, allowing patients to quickly resume their normal activities. Additionally, the cost of a virtual colonoscopy is significantly lower than a real colonoscopy, and there is less risk of puncturing the bowel. However, both types of colonoscopies require patients to drink strong laxatives, which is a major complaint among patients. If lesions are spotted during a virtual colonoscopy, a real colonoscopy is required to remove them. Virtual colonoscopies can also be uncomfortable as they require briefly inflating the bowel with carbon dioxide. Colorectal cancer kills 52,000 people in the United States each year, and most Americans are advised to begin regular colonoscopies at age 50. However, only about half of the 70 million Americans at risk for colon cancer are currently getting screened. The availability of a noninvasive method like the virtual colonoscopy may encourage more people to get tested. Gastroenterologists are concerned that the popularity of virtual colonoscopies may take away business from them. However, Dr. Brooks Cash of the American Gastroenterology Association believes that the availability of a noninvasive method has actually increased the volume of colonoscopies performed. This means that more people may require follow-up colonoscopies to remove any polyps that could potentially develop into tumors. Overall, the study concludes that the virtual colonoscopy is a reasonable and accurate test for colon cancer screening. It uses half the radiation of a standard CT scan and may be a more accessible option for patients.",true,"Doctors who perform colonoscopies should not be worried that they may lose business to so-called virtual colonoscopies, despite reports that both approaches work equally well at detecting colon cancer, a gastroenterology expert said on Wednesday.","A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that both real and virtual colonoscopies are equally effective in detecting precancerous polyps.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has found that both real and virtual colonoscopies are equally effective in detecting precancerous polyps. The study, conducted by Dr. Daniel Johnson and his colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, involved performing both types of colonoscopies on 2,500 volunteers. The virtual colonoscopy, also known as CT colonography or CTC, uses an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner to detect polyps, while the real colonoscopy is done by gastroenterologists using a flexible lit tube passed through the bowel.

The study found that the virtual colonoscopy detected 90% of precancerous polyps that were 10 millimeters or larger. While both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, the virtual colonoscopy does not require sedation, allowing patients to quickly resume their normal activities. Additionally, the cost of a virtual colonoscopy is significantly lower than a real colonoscopy, and there is less risk of puncturing the bowel.

However, both types of colonoscopies require patients to drink strong laxatives, which is a major complaint among patients. If lesions are spotted during a virtual colonoscopy, a real colonoscopy is required to remove them. Virtual colonoscopies can also be uncomfortable as they require briefly inflating the bowel with carbon dioxide.

Colorectal cancer kills 52,000 people in the United States each year, and most Americans are advised to begin regular colonoscopies at age 50. However, only about half of the 70 million Americans at risk for colon cancer are currently getting screened. The availability of a noninvasive method like the virtual colonoscopy may encourage more people to get tested.

Gastroenterologists are concerned that the popularity of virtual colonoscopies may take away business from them. However, Dr. Brooks Cash of the American Gastroenterology Association believes that the availability of a noninvasive method has actually increased the volume of colonoscopies performed. This means that more people may require follow-up colonoscopies to remove any polyps that could potentially develop into tumors.

Overall, the study concludes that the virtual colonoscopy is a reasonable and accurate test for colon cancer screening. It uses half the radiation of a standard CT scan and may be a more accessible option for patients.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government has spent $1.5 trillion on the war in Afghanistan is false. The actual cost of the war is much higher, with estimates ranging from $2 trillion to $4 trillion. The war in Afghanistan has been ongoing since 2001, and the U.S. has spent over $1 trillion on it. However, the cost of the war is not limited to direct military spending. The war has also had significant indirect costs, such as the loss of life and limb, the displacement of millions of people, and the destruction of infrastructure.

The war in Afghanistan has been a major drain on the U.S. economy, with the cost of the war exceeding the cost of the Vietnam War and the Korean War combined.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:

What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain.

53,10372,Drug May Delay Pancreatic Cancer Return,"A new study has found that a drug called capecitabine may help delay the return of pancreatic cancer after surgery. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved 730 patients who had undergone surgery to remove pancreatic cancer. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine, while the other half received a placebo. The researchers found that the drug reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 40% compared to the placebo group. The median time to cancer recurrence was 23 months in the capecitabine group, compared to 19 months in the placebo group. The study also found that the drug did not have any significant impact on overall survival. However, the researchers noted that the study was not designed to assess overall survival and that further research is needed to determine if the drug can improve survival rates. The side effects of capecitabine were described as relatively mild, including fatigue and hair thinning. These side effects are common with chemotherapy drugs and are considered manageable. The drug is already used to treat inoperable pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer, so its safety profile is well-established. Dr. Smith, a researcher not involved in the study, commented on the findings, stating that the study provides important evidence for the use of capecitabine in preventing cancer recurrence after surgery. He also noted that the drug is a valuable addition to the treatment options for pancreatic cancer. The article mentions that the study is part of a larger body of research on pancreatic cancer. A previous study published last year also supported the use of capecitabine in treating pancreatic cancer. This suggests that the latest findings are consistent with previous research and add to the growing evidence for the effectiveness of the drug. In conclusion, the study found that capecitabine may help delay the return of pancreatic cancer after surgery. The drug reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 40% compared to a placebo.

### Input:
Context: A new study has found that a drug called capecitabine may help delay the return of pancreatic cancer after surgery. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, involved 730 patients who had undergone surgery to remove pancreatic cancer. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine, while the other half received a placebo. The researchers found that the drug reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 40% compared to the placebo group. The median time to cancer recurrence was 23 months in the capecitabine group, compared to 19 months in the placebo group.

The study also found that the drug did not have any significant impact on overall survival. However, the researchers noted that the study was not designed to assess overall survival and that further research is needed to determine if the drug can improve survival rates.

The side effects of capecitabine were described as relatively mild, including fatigue and hair thinning. These side effects are common with chemotherapy drugs and are considered manageable. The drug is already used to treat inoperable pancreatic cancer and other types of cancer, so its safety profile is well-established.

Dr. Smith, a researcher not involved in the study, commented on the findings, stating that the study provides important evidence for the use of capecitabine in preventing cancer recurrence after surgery. He also noted that the drug is a valuable addition to the treatment options for pancreatic cancer.

The article mentions that the study is part of a larger body of research on pancreatic cancer. A previous study published last year also supported the use of capecitabine in treating pancreatic cancer. This suggests that the latest findings are consistent with previous research and add to the growing evidence for the effectiveness of the drug.

In conclusion, the study found that capecitabine may help delay the return of pancreatic cancer after surgery. The drug reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 40% compared to a placebo. The side effects of the drug were described as relatively mild. The study adds to the existing evidence for the use of capecitabine in treating pancreatic cancer and provides valuable information for clinicians and patients.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain.

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: India is closely monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies due to concerns about how it would handle a widespread outbreak of the coronavirus. Despite having only six reported cases, authorities in India are increasing screenings at airports and border crossings and urging citizens to avoid large crowds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided not to attend the Hindu Holi festival, which is scheduled to be held across the country next week, in order to reduce mass gatherings. An employee of Paytm, an Indian payments company backed by Alibaba and SoftBank, tested positive for the virus after vacationing in Italy. As a precaution, all Paytm employees have been advised to work from home while the offices are sanitized. In addition, 15 out of 21 tourists from Italy who were taken to a quarantine facility in New Delhi tested positive for the virus, along with their Indian driver. The rise in cases caused Indian stock markets to slide nearly 2%, but they later recovered. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan announced that all international passengers will now be screened, not just those from 12 specific countries as before. India, the world's largest supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of pharmaceuticals due to fears of shortages caused by the coronavirus, causing panic in Europe.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: Bike sharing programs can have significant health benefits for city dwellers, even for short cycling trips. Dr. Robert Oppliger, an exercise physiologist, states that even a two-to-three-mile bike ride can have positive effects on weight and cardiovascular health. Government guidelines recommend adults accumulate 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per week, and cycling can be part of that. The American Medical Association recently designated obesity as a disease, and cycling can help combat this issue. However, not all cities are suitable for bike share programs, as they may not be designed for avid cyclists or have the necessary infrastructure. New York City, for example, has a massive bike sharing program and has added 200 bike lane miles in the past three years. Bicycling magazine's Editor-in-Chief, Peter Flax, believes that New York City is well-suited for bike share due to its flat terrain and efficiency. While the program may face a period of adjustment, attitudes are expected to change as the bikes become more integrated into street life. Taxi drivers are already adapting their behavior to avoid accidents with cyclists. The goal of bike sharing programs, such as the one in New York City, is to make it easier for residents to get around the city. So far, over 44,780 people have signed up for annual membership in the New York program. Fitness expert Liz Neporent supports the program, stating that cycling is a great way to get people moving and improve cardiovascular health. She also notes that cycling is a low-impact exercise that does not stress the joints. Overall, bike sharing programs can provide significant fitness benefits for city dwellers, even for short commutes.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The article discusses the potential benefits of fertility supplements for women who are trying to conceive. It mentions a small study that found that women who took chasteberry supplements had a higher pregnancy rate compared to those who did not take the supplements. However, the article is careful not to make any specific claims about the effectiveness of the supplements in improving fertility by a certain percentage.

The article does not mention any potential harms or side effects of the supplements, such as nausea, headaches, GI disturbances, and menstrual cycle irregularities, which are associated with chasteberry. It suggests that the article should have highlighted this information, even if the harms are not fully known.

The article provides details about the study that was conducted using the supplements, but it does not comment on whether these results have been validated by other studies. It also mentions that conception is a ""mysterious business"" and that it is not fully understood, emphasizing that variation in time to conceive is normal and women should not rush to get supplements right away.

The article quotes more than one expert, including one who was involved with the study and one who was not. This independent source is considered crucial in the story.

The article does not describe alternative options for improving fertility, other than suggesting women to ""see a doctor."" It could have mentioned other options such as monitoring ovulation, quitting smoking and drinking, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress and depression, which may also help in improving fertility.

The article clearly states that the supplements are available on the company website, but it is unclear whether they are available elsewhere. It also mentions that fertility supplements are not a new idea and that the inclusion of an independent source in the story shows that it did not solely rely on a news release.

The chronic health conditions included obesity, asthma, and learning problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The researchers emphasized the importance of access to healthcare for children in order to diagnose and treat these conditions. They stated that primary care is especially crucial as many of these conditions are picked up and treated there. The study also found that while 16.6% of children had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study period, 20.8% reported having a chronic condition at the end. However, only 7.4% of children had a chronic condition both at the beginning and at the end of the study period, and 9.3% of children reported having a chronic condition at the beginning that was not present at the end. The researchers described this as a hopeful finding, as it suggests that many chronic conditions in children can resolve over time. They called for further research to understand why some conditions go away while others do not, and to identify factors that contribute to improvements in children's health. Dr. Geetha Raghuveer, who was not involved in the study, expressed concern about the large percentage of children with chronic health problems and called for prevention strategies at the family, school, community, and policy levels to address these issues.

Context: A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found that the rate of chronic health conditions among children in the United States has doubled from 12.8% in 1994 to 26.6% in 2006. The study used data from a government survey of three groups of children aged 2 through 8 between 1988 and 2006. The chronic health conditions included obesity, asthma, and learning problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The researchers emphasized the importance of access to healthcare for children in order to diagnose and treat these conditions. They stated that primary care is especially crucial as many of these conditions are picked up and treated there. The study also found that while 16.6% of children had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study period, 20.8% reported having a chronic condition at the end. However, only 7.4% of children had a chronic condition both at the beginning and at the end of the study period, and 9.3% of children reported having a chronic condition at the beginning that was not present at the end. The researchers described this as a hopeful finding, as it suggests that many chronic conditions in children can resolve over time. They called for further research to understand why some conditions go away while others do not, and to identify factors that contribute to improvements in children's health. Dr. Geetha Raghuveer, who was not involved in the study, expressed concern about the large percentage of children with chronic health problems and called for prevention strategies at the family, school, community, and policy levels to address these issues. Overall, the study highlights the rising prevalence of chronic health conditions among children in the U.S. and the importance of access to healthcare for early diagnosis and treatment.

64,22383,There is a growing body of evidence that radiation in excess of what the government says are the minimum amounts you should be exposed to are actually good for you and reduce cases of cancer.,"The claim made by Ann Coulter that there is a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that radiation in excess of government-approved exposure levels may be beneficial is not widely accepted by the scientific community. While there are some scientists who believe in the concept of hormesis, which suggests that low levels of radiation can have beneficial health effects, this is considered an outside-the-mainstream opinion. Eric Hall, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, states that there is not a shred of evidence that radiation is good for you, and Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico, calls hormesis a controversial concept. Mettler does mention early studies that seemed to suggest a hormetic effect, but he cautions against reading too much into these studies due to various factors that can influence the results. Owen Hoffman, a radiation-risk expert, explains that while low levels of radiation might eliminate some cancers, they can also initiate and promote new cancers. Dr. Charles Land of the National Cancer Institute also concludes that the possibility of a protective or beneficial effect of radiation exposure cannot be completely ruled out, but the evidence does not support the presence of such effects in human populations. Coulter cites the work of Bernard L. Cohen, a physics professor, who found a correlation between radon exposure and lung cancer rates in certain counties. However, Cohen clarifies that his study was designed to test the assumption that the danger of radiation is simply proportional to the radiation dose, and his conclusion was that this assumption is false. While there is a small but growing body of research supporting the idea of hormesis, the mainstream scientific community does not embrace this theory.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: A paralyzed man in California has become the first person with a spinal cord injury to walk without the use of robotics, thanks to brain-to-computer technology. The ""proof-of-concept"" study, conducted by scientists from the University of California, Irvine, documented how the technology enabled the man to walk by converting his thoughts into body motion. The man, identified as Fritz, had to keep his mind focused entirely on placing one foot in front of the other as his brain waves were translated by a computer algorithm into impulses that bypassed his severed spinal cord and activated his legs. Fritz was able to walk a distance of 12 feet entirely by his own leg muscles, although his weight was partially supported by an overhead suspension harness and a walker. The outcome of the study is seen as a promising achievement in the development of brain-computer interfaces that may help stroke and spinal injury patients regain mobility in the future. However, clinical applications are still years away. Fritz underwent nearly a year of physical and mental training to prepare for the experiment, using a virtual-reality simulator to learn to control a video-animated character using his brain waves. Neural signals produced as he concentrated on moving his legs were detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG) worn over his head, processed through a computer algorithm, and relayed to electrodes placed around his knees to stimulate his muscles. Fritz expressed his belief that a cure or treatment for spinal cord injury will be developed within his lifetime, and he has volunteered to take part in future research stages to further improve the technology.

66,7525,Trump scrambles to broaden coronavirus testing options.,"President Donald Trump and his administration have declared a national emergency and unveiled a new testing strategy to screen hundreds of thousands of Americans for the coronavirus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms.

Context: The claim that the coronavirus is a hoax is false. The virus is real, and it has caused a global pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a public health emergency of international concern. The virus is highly contagious and can be spread through respiratory droplets, close contact, and contaminated surfaces. It can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia, organ failure, and death.

The virus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to over 100 countries.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:

What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The article discusses the claim made by Rep. Michael McCaul that there is no mental health evaluation when people enter the military. The article examines the current process for enlisting in the armed forces and whether or not there is a separate mental health evaluation.

According to the article, there is no formal mental health evaluation when individuals enlist in the military. However, as part of the initial screening process, military officials review the medical records of potential service members for their mental health history. They also ask potential soldiers to complete questionnaires where they may disclose information about past diagnoses or treatments, or other indicators of behavioral problems. If an individual has a documented history of mental health issues or discloses information that suggests behavioral problems, they may be precluded from gaining admittance to the service branches.

The article also mentions a recent study that found 1 in 5 servicemembers had a mental health disorder before enlisting. Once enlisted, service members are subject to frequent mental health evaluations before and after deployment. They have access to mental health and physical health care providers while on deployment, and upon returning from deployment, they undergo further assessments.

While some argue that a mental health evaluation upfront would be helpful, others believe it would drive the problems further underground. The article concludes that compared to the physical medical examination potential enlistees go through, there is no separate, specific examination of a recruit's mental health. The current procedures do not prevent individuals with mental health problems from being accepted into the military.

In summary, the article confirms Rep. Michael McCaul's claim that there is no mental health evaluation when people enter the military. While there is a review of medical records and the opportunity for individuals to disclose information about their mental health history, there is no separate examination specifically focused on mental health.
Claim: When people enter the service, there’s not a mental health evaluation.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The article discusses the recent health issues of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, as well as their respective plans and strategies for the presidential campaign. Clinton returned to the campaign trail after being diagnosed with pneumonia, stating that her time away helped clarify her race against Trump. She emphasized that her campaign is focused on offering ideas rather than insults. Meanwhile, Trump outlined his plans to lower taxes and cut regulations, with the goal of boosting economic growth and creating new jobs. He released a new letter from his doctor detailing his health information, including his blood pressure, cholesterol, and medications. Clinton also released a letter from her physician with similar information. Both candidates' doctors declared them fit to serve as president. The article also mentions that the race between Clinton and Trump is tighter than expected, with Clinton facing voter mistrust but still maintaining more pathways to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House. Clinton made her first campaign stop in North Carolina, a battleground state that Obama lost in 2012, while Trump needs to carry the state to win the election. Clinton criticized North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory for signing a law that prevents transgender people from using restrooms that do not correspond to their birth certificates. The article concludes by mentioning that Clinton and Obama separately addressed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute gala, with Clinton criticizing Trump for his refusal to say that Obama was born in the United States. The Trump campaign later issued a statement saying that Trump now believes Obama was born in the United States.

71,6002,‘Super coral’ scientist dies in Hawaii at age 56.,"Dr. Ruth Gates, a renowned coral researcher and president of the International Society for Reef Studies, has passed away at the age of 56.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

### Response:

72,4495,Pakistan court frees ex-PM Sharif for medical treatment.,"The Lahore High Court in Pakistan has announced that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will be released on bail for medical treatment. The decision came after a petition from Sharif's brother, Shahbaz Sharif, who leads the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League party. However, Sharif will not be automatically freed as he still faces another appeal hearing for bail next week. Sharif was rushed from prison to a government hospital in Lahore on Monday due to a deteriorating health condition. He has remained under the supervision of prison authorities. Sharif, who has served as prime minister three times, has a history of health problems, including heart disease. His lawyer stated that Sharif cannot be released immediately until a separate appeal hearing takes place next Tuesday, which pertains to his second corruption conviction. Sharif's brother expressed gratitude to the judiciary for granting bail and requested the nation to pray for his speedy recovery. Sharif's spokesperson hopes that he will also be granted bail in the second case so that he can receive medical treatment at a hospital of his choice. It is unclear whether Sharif would wish to travel outside Pakistan for treatment. Initially, doctors believed Sharif had contracted dengue fever, but later medical tests revealed that his immune system malfunctioned, resulting in a low platelet count. Concerned about his deteriorating health, Sharif's family petitioned the court for his release. Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz were convicted and sentenced on corruption charges while he was in London visiting his wife in the hospital. They were arrested upon their return to Pakistan and imprisoned. Although Sharif's 12-year conviction in one case was suspended, he was serving a seven-year jail term when he was questioned by the country's anti-graft body in another case related to his family's sugar mills.",true,"A top Pakistani court on Friday ordered convicted former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif released on bail so he can seek medical treatment at home or abroad, his family and a defense lawyer said.","The Lahore High Court in Pakistan has announced that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will be released on bail for medical treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The article provides a timeline of key moments in the lead in water crisis in Flint, Michigan. In April 2014, Flint began drawing water from the Flint River as a temporary measure to save money. However, residents immediately complained about the smell, taste, and appearance of the water, as well as health concerns such as rashes and hair loss. In January 2015, Detroit offered to reconnect Flint to its water system, but Flint leaders insisted the water was safe. In September 2015, a group of doctors found high levels of lead in the blood of children and urged Flint to stop using the Flint River for water, but state regulators insisted the water was safe. It was not until September 29, 2015, that Governor Rick Snyder acknowledged that lead was a problem and pledged to take action.

In October 2015, Snyder announced that the state would spend $1 million to buy water filters and test water in Flint public schools, and called for Flint to go back to using water from Detroit's system. On January 5, 2016, Snyder declared a state of emergency in Flint, and federal officials confirmed that they were investigating. Snyder asked the Obama administration for a major disaster declaration and more federal aid, which was provided on January 16, 2016. In mid-March 2016, state officials testified before Congress, and a governor-appointed panel concluded that the state of Michigan was ""fundamentally accountable"" for the crisis. In April 2016, two state officials and a local official were charged with evidence tampering and other crimes.

In December 2016, Congress approved $170 million to address lead in Flint's drinking water. In February 2017, the Michigan Civil Rights Commission issued a report stating that ""systemic racism"" was at the core of the water crisis. In March 2017, Snyder announced that his administration would enact the country's toughest lead limit for water. In March 2017, a judge approved a landmark deal to replace water lines in homes in Flint. In June 2017, Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon and four others were charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Flint area. In April 2018, Snyder ended water distribution in Flint, stating that the water quality had significantly improved. In July 2019, a federal watchdog called on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen its oversight of state drinking water systems and respond more quickly to public health emergencies like the Flint crisis. The EPA agreed with the recommendations and said it would adopt them expeditiously. In August 2019, a judge ordered Lyon to stand trial on involuntary manslaughter charges related to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak.

74,33343,Wedding guests should refrain from throwing rice at newly-wedded couples because the rice kills birds who eat it.,"The article debunks the claim that throwing rice at weddings is harmful to birds. The claim suggests that rice expands in bird stomachs, causing them to explode. In 1985, a Connecticut state legislator proposed a bill to ban the throwing of uncooked rice at weddings to prevent bird deaths. However, local ornithologists and experts from the Audubon Society and the Connecticut Audubon Society stated that they had never heard of birds dying from consuming rice thrown at weddings. The article explains that the belief that rice can harm birds is a myth. Rice must be boiled before it expands, and the moisture in a bird's stomach is not enough to cause rice to swell and rupture the bird. The article cites a response from an ornithologist at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, who confirms that rice is not a threat to birds and that the rumor has caused unnecessary fear. To provide empirical evidence, a biology professor and his students conducted experiments to test the theory. They found that soaked white rice expanded by 33% in volume, while bird seed increased by 40%. Instant rice, which expands more than regular rice, was also tested on models of bird crops and real birds. None of the models burst, and the birds showed no signs of distress or injury after being fed instant rice. The article also mentions that the prohibition of rice throwing at weddings is more about cleanliness and safety than bird welfare. Rice and confetti can be difficult to clean up, and scattered rice on hard surfaces can cause people to slip and fall. In conclusion, the claim that throwing rice at weddings kills birds is false.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

75,1531,Puppy love: therapy pooches bring peace of mind at Spanish psychiatric center.,"A psychiatric center in a town near the border with France is using therapy dogs to help patients with intellectual disabilities and mental health conditions. The dogs, named Atila and Argi, live on the grounds and are cared for by the patients themselves. The patients are responsible for the dogs 24 hours a day, which helps promote good habits like self-control and personal hygiene. Patients groom and feed the dogs, as well as take them for daily walks to the nearby village. The dogs serve as icebreakers, facilitating conversation with the locals and helping patients develop social skills. The therapy dogs also provide emotional support to patients who struggle to connect with others. The dogs tailor their behavior according to the needs of each patient, playing with those who are more active and sitting still with those who find moving challenging. Patients referred to their feelings for the dogs using words like ""calmness,"" ""companionship,"" and ""affection."" The dogs also work with patients who are unable to feed or walk them, sitting with severe dementia patients to combat isolation and depression by stimulating their senses of touch. The presence of the therapy dogs has become an integral part of the center, with the head nurse stating that ""the dogs are now part of the center."" The dogs provide a calming effect and serve as an emotional outlet for the patients. The patients benefit from the companionship and affection of the dogs, helping them develop a sense of autonomy and improve their social skills.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The claim states that 66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. However, it is mentioned in the article that this information is not collected nationally, so there is no exact data on the number of closures. In 2014, there were plans to close or downgrade 66 wards in England, but it is unclear how many have actually been closed.

Overall, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted due to the lack of comprehensive data on the closure of A&E and maternity wards.

### Input:
Context: Congress is facing the possibility of mandatory spending cuts called ""the sequester"" unless they intervene before March 1. Rep. Earl Blumenauer made a statement in December about ending the wasteful direct payment farm subsidy program, which he believes could save up to $28.4 billion over ten years. This is a popular idea for cutting federal spending, as President Obama also called for eliminating farm subsidies in 2011, which would save $5 billion a year. The payments are given regardless of current crop prices and do not require the crops to be grown on the land receiving payments. In 2010, 551 people with Portland addresses collected farm subsidies totaling $2.8 million. The Congressional Budget Office calculated that ending these subsidies would save $28.4 billion over 10 years. Blumenauer wants this money to be used to pay down the nation's $1.1 trillion deficit. Legislation to trim direct payments passed the Senate last year but did not come to a vote in the House. The number of savings from ending the direct payment farm subsidy program is solid and was generated by the Congressional Budget Office.

They reside in the digestive tracts of infected humans or animals, using the suckers on their heads to hold themselves in place. Tapeworms can grow to more than 30 feet in length and may or may not cause noticeable symptoms.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire.

This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: An investigative reporter with WFLA News Channel 8 in Tampa, Florida, named Victoria Price, was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer contacted her to point out a noticeable lump in her throat. Price confirmed the claim to be true in an email to Snopes. She shared her story on Twitter, explaining that as a journalist, she had been working non-stop since the pandemic began and had not been focused on her own health. However, a viewer emailed her and mentioned a lump on her neck that reminded her of her own cancer. Price went to the doctor and was diagnosed with cancer. Due to COVID-19 responses, there were some delays in diagnosis, but Price was scheduled to undergo surgery in mid-July 2020 to remove the tumor, thyroid, and a few nearby lymph nodes. Her doctor informed her that the cancer had spread, but not significantly, and they were hopeful that this would be her first and last procedure. Price expressed gratitude for the viewer's email, stating that if she had not received it, she would not have called her doctor, and the cancer would have continued to spread. The article concludes by mentioning that the situation began when Price received an email from a concerned viewer who asked her to have her thyroid checked.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

80,11296,Single Dose of Hallucinogenic Drug Psilocybin Relieves Anxiety and Depression in Patients with Advanced Cancer,"The article discusses a study that found a single dose of the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin to be effective in relieving anxiety and depression in patients with advanced cancer. The study involved 51 participants who received either a high dose of psilocybin or a placebo. The results showed that 80% of the participants who received psilocybin experienced a reduction in anxiety and depression, compared to 30% of those who received the placebo. The article highlights that the release refers to psilocybin as being ""inexpensive"" as a potential clinical treatment option, but does not provide any basis for this claim or compare it to other treatments. It also notes that the release does not quantify the extent of the benefits of psilocybin treatment, using vague terms like ""significantly lessens mental anguish"" and ""relief from distress."" The article argues that it is important for research institutions to provide more detailed information about the benefits and potential side effects of treatments. The release does a good job of describing the study design and the number of participants, but it does not discuss the use of counseling as a stand-alone treatment option for anxiety or depression, nor does it compare psilocybin treatment with other pharmaceutical options. The article suggests that the release would have been stronger if it had provided a comparison of the pros and cons of different treatment methods. The release acknowledges that psilocybin is a banned substance and that larger clinical trials would be needed for it to be used as a safe and effective medication.

The release notes that 80 percent of participants showed improvement based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression for several months following the treatment. The study is one of two on the subject that were published recently in the Journal of Psychopharmacology (our review of the release for the other study can be found here and a review of a related news article can be read here.) The release does better than its counterpart in terms of addressing conflicts of interest and placing the work in context with previous work in the field. However, the release uses only vague language when addressing the key issues of health benefits and adverse side effects. More specifics on the degree of reduced anxiety and depression scores would have been useful. Because this study and its counterpart offer an intriguing finding — that a single dose of something could be so helpful in alleviating depression — we’ve completed three reviews related to these studies: one on a news story from the LA Times, one on a news release from Johns Hopkins, and this review on the release from NYU. And the core issues involved are similar across all three items. Cancer is a widespread health problem that affects many millions of Americans. According to the National Cancer Institute, just under 1.7 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer in 2016 alone. If you consider that each of those people has a family and loved ones who are also affected by the diagnosis, you can begin to appreciate the scope of the problem. According to a report from the National Institutes of Health’s 2002 State-of-the-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain, Depression, and Fatigue, “The clinical ‘rule of thumb’ is that 25 percent of cancer patients are likely depressed enough at some point in the course of disease to warrant evaluation and treatment.” This makes it especially important for research institutions and news outlets to write responsibly about studies like those discussed in this release. You want to give readers enough information to help them make informed decisions. You don’t want to raise false hopes, or sensationalize the work. We think all three summaries on this growing body of research reported responsibly on the findings.","The article discusses a study that found a single dose of the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin to be effective in relieving anxiety and depression in patients with advanced cancer. The study involved 51 participants who received either a high dose of psilocybin or a placebo. The results showed that 80% of the participants who received psilocybin experienced a reduction in anxiety and depression, compared to 30% of those who received the placebo.

The article highlights that the release refers to psilocybin as being ""inexpensive"" as a potential clinical treatment option, but does not provide any basis for this claim or compare it to other treatments. It also notes that the release does not quantify the extent of the benefits of psilocybin treatment, using vague terms like ""significantly lessens mental anguish"" and ""relief from distress."" The article argues that it is important for research institutions to provide more detailed information about the benefits and potential side effects of treatments.

The release does a good job of describing the study design and the number of participants, but it does not discuss the use of counseling as a stand-alone treatment option for anxiety or depression, nor does it compare psilocybin treatment with other pharmaceutical options. The article suggests that the release would have been stronger if it had provided a comparison of the pros and cons of different treatment methods.

The release acknowledges that psilocybin is a banned substance and that larger clinical trials would be needed for it to be used as a safe and effective medication. It also notes that the study provides the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy and that psilocybin has an established safety profile.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.

But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

81,9256,FDA Clears P-Cure Upright Imaging Solution for Proton Therapy Enhancement,"The article discusses the FDA clearance of P-Cure's upright imaging solution for proton therapy enhancement. The release highlights the potential economic advantages of treating patients in a seated position, stating that it reduces capital investment for the proton beam center. However, it is important to note that the cost savings mentioned in the release refer to the center per patient treated, not the cost for patients themselves. The release does not provide any quantified data on the benefits of the device for patients, such as improved treatment outcomes, comfort, or duration. It also fails to mention any potential harms associated with the therapy. The article criticizes the imprecision of the term ""approval"" used in the release, stating that the company received FDA clearance to market the device, not an approval. The clearance indicates that the device is deemed similar to other approved devices, without requiring proof of safety or effectiveness. The FDA's market clearance letter describes the device as a computed tomography X-ray system intended for scanning patients while seated. The release states that the therapy will initially benefit adult and pediatric patients with cancers of the lung, breast, chest, head and neck, and lower torso. However, the article points out that the release implies an abundance of demand for this therapy without providing evidence-based support. It also notes that the release comes from P-Cure, the company producing the therapy, and compares it to existing devices used for proton beam therapy.

The article acknowledges that the therapy is a modification of prone delivery of proton therapy and is not currently widely available. However, it criticizes the use of terms like ""clinical breakthrough"" and ""paradigm shifting"" without evidence to support these claims. The article suggests that if the treatment is successful, it will have more people sitting up instead of lying down, but emphasizes the need for evidence to support the claims made in the release.",mixture,"P-Cure Ltd. device We’re fully prepared to believe that there are ways to more accurately administer proton beam therapy with fewer side effects and lower costs. This release makes just those claims and yet provides nothing to back the claims up. There is no quantification of benefits. No true exploration of risks. No explanation of the quality of the evidence. And no true comparison of alternatives. The release muddies the water on what kind of nod it got from the US’s regulatory agency. The company received FDA “clearance” to market the device but not an “approval.” (See the discussion under the Quality of Evidence criteria.) Proton beam therapy represents an alternative form of radiotherapy compared to conventional x-rays. Interest in this form of therapy has grown based upon its ability to deliver higher doses of radiation to a smaller field. This may improve the benefit and reduce the harm for patients with cancer who need radiotherapy. Although not a focus in this release, the proven outcomes of proton vs. conventional radiotherapy in terms of benefits (increased survival) and harms (less damage to surrounding normal tissue) are less clear than the proponents of proton therapy would like to admit. For many cancers, conventional therapy may be adequate. Here the question is whether the delivery of proton beam therapy to patients who are getting it can be enhanced by delivering the treatment to the patient in a seated compared to a flat position. One can imagine for some patients that may lead to a more comfortable treatment, but it isn’t clear how many would derive a measurable benefit. The release focuses on decreases in the discomfort of treatment and implies that some who may not otherwise tolerate this therapy could now have it. All interesting, but no information is provided to support the release’s claims. Finally, the release focuses on the potential benefits to the proton beam center in terms of its costs — but patients will have other questions about cost such as whether the device is more expensive than what the center is currently using. If so, those costs may be passed on to insurers and thus patients based upon the specifics of their policy. As such, it isn’t clear whether the “clinical breakthrough” or “paradigm shift” will be apparent to the average patient undergoing this form of cancer treatment.","The article discusses the FDA clearance of P-Cure's upright imaging solution for proton therapy enhancement.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The article discusses the FDA clearance of P-Cure's upright imaging solution for proton therapy enhancement. The release highlights the potential economic advantages of treating patients in a seated position, stating that it reduces capital investment for the proton beam center. However, it is important to note that the cost savings mentioned in the release refer to the center per patient treated, not the cost for patients themselves. The release does not provide any quantified data on the benefits of the device for patients, such as improved treatment outcomes, comfort, or duration. It also fails to mention any potential harms associated with the therapy.

The article criticizes the imprecision of the term ""approval"" used in the release, stating that the company received FDA clearance to market the device, not an approval. The clearance indicates that the device is deemed similar to other approved devices, without requiring proof of safety or effectiveness. The FDA's market clearance letter describes the device as a computed tomography X-ray system intended for scanning patients while seated.

The release states that the therapy will initially benefit adult and pediatric patients with cancers of the lung, breast, chest, head and neck, and lower torso. However, the article points out that the release implies an abundance of demand for this therapy without providing evidence-based support. It also notes that the release comes from P-Cure, the company producing the therapy, and compares it to existing devices used for proton beam therapy. The release highlights the drawbacks of standard proton therapy, such as radiation to healthy body parts, discomfort, and high costs, but does not provide quantification or meaningful comparison for reporters and patients.

The article acknowledges that the therapy is a modification of prone delivery of proton therapy and is not currently widely available. However, it criticizes the use of terms like ""clinical breakthrough"" and ""paradigm shifting"" without evidence to support these claims. The article suggests that if the treatment is successful, it will have more people sitting up instead of lying down, but emphasizes the need for evidence to support the claims made in the release.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld a C$15 billion ($11.3 billion) judgment against three major tobacco companies in Canada. The judgment involves class action suits that were consolidated against the Canadian subsidiaries of British American Tobacco, Philip Morris International, and Japan Tobacco International. The companies were appealing a 2015 Quebec Superior Court ruling that awarded damages to around 100,000 Quebec smokers and ex-smokers who claimed that the companies knew since the 1950s that their products were causing cancer and other illnesses but failed to adequately warn consumers. The judgment is considered a ""huge defeat"" for the tobacco industry, according to Rob Cunningham from the Canadian Cancer Society. The companies are expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The judgment comes at a time when tobacco companies are investing heavily in vaping devices that they claim are less harmful than traditional smoking. The two Quebec suits, known as the Letourneau and Blais cases, were filed in 1998 and certified as class actions in 2005. The cases were consolidated into one before the trial proceedings began in 2012 and concluded in 2014. The companies involved in the case expressed disappointment with the decision and stated that they fundamentally disagree with the court's judgment. They also mentioned that the Canadian cases are likely to take years to play out in the courts. British American Tobacco said it will review the court's decision in more detail before deciding on next steps.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer.

Sununu has stated that he would use a bipartisan selection commission. The Supreme Court is the state's highest court and has made important decisions on issues such as the death penalty, privacy rights, and school funding.

Other departments that Sununu will make appointments for include labor, corrections, liquor, cultural resources, agriculture, insurance, and resources and economic development.

Overall, Sununu's appointments will have a significant impact on judicial and education policy in New Hampshire, as well as other areas of governance.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government has been using the coronavirus pandemic to push for a cashless society is false. The claim is based on a misinterpretation of a statement made by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The bank's president, Eric Rosengren, said that the pandemic has accelerated the shift towards digital payments and that the Fed is working to ensure that the payments system is safe and secure. However, he did not suggest that the government is using the pandemic to push for a cashless society.

The claim also ignores the fact that the U.S. government has not taken any steps to ban cash or promote a cashless society. In fact, the government has taken steps to ensure that cash remains an option for those who need it. For example, the Federal Reserve has increased the production of cash to meet the demand during the pandemic.

The claim also fails to consider the benefits of digital payments. Digital payments are faster, more secure, and",true,"Sununu appointments to shape judicial, education policy.""} "

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Vice President Mike Pence said that White House aide Rob Porter's alleged domestic abuse was supported by the Bible is false. After Rob Porter resigned amid allegations of domestic violence in February 2018, a fake news article claimed that Pence had publicly expressed support for Porter, using Bible verses. However, this claim originated from a fake news article published by a website called ""Fox News the FB Page,"" which is not affiliated with the actual Fox News. The website uses the cable news channel's style and logos in its content but is a parody page.

In reality, Vice President Pence stated publicly that he was ""appalled"" when he learned of the domestic abuse allegations against Porter. He also maintained that he did not know about the allegations until Porter's resignation. The fake news article used this small piece of truth as a starting point to make the false claim that Pence later ""softened"" his stance on the issue and leaned on Biblical teachings for guidance. The article falsely quoted Pence as saying that Porter's actions, if true, were ""in accordance with Biblical principles"" and that women should ""submit to their husbands as their husbands are their heads just as Jesus is head of the church.""

The passage mentioned in the fake news article, which appears to be a reference to Ephesians 5:22, states, ""Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior."" However, Pence did not make any such statement regarding the Porter allegations, nor did he ""soften"" his stance on the subject.

In conclusion, the claim that Vice President Mike Pence said that Rob Porter's alleged domestic abuse was supported by the Bible is false. The fake news article that originated from a parody website falsely attributed these statements to Pence, while in reality, he expressed his appallment at the allegations and did not support Porter's actions.

87,5655,Can brain disease explain Aaron Hernandez’s behavior?.,"The article discusses the findings of Dr. Ann McKee, a Boston University researcher, who discovered evidence of severe chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the brain of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez. Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence for murder, hung himself in prison at the age of 27. The article also mentions that Hernandez's lawyer filed a lawsuit against the NFL and the New England Patriots, claiming they failed to protect their players' safety. CTE is a brain disease that can affect areas of the brain involved in regulating behavior and emotions. Symptoms of CTE in former football players include aggression, depression, memory loss, and dementia. However, it is unclear whether CTE-related brain damage directly causes these behaviors, as substance abuse and other illnesses may also be linked to these symptoms. Repeated head blows from contact sports and military combat are the most likely causes of CTE. These blows can cause the brain to ricochet inside the skull, damaging nerve cells. Researchers are also investigating the role of genetics, drugs, and alcohol in making certain individuals more susceptible to CTE. CTE can only be diagnosed after death, and a defining feature is the abnormal deposits of tau protein in the brain. In a study conducted by Dr. McKee, CTE was found in the brains of almost all ex-NFL players studied, as well as in former college and high school players who died by suicide or drug overdoses. The true frequency of CTE in football, other sports, the military, and the general population is not known. It is also unclear how many head hits Hernandez experienced throughout his football career. However, Dr. McKee has found evidence of CTE in an 18-year-old and three high school players, suggesting that the disease can occur at a young age.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20.

The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

89,9866,Gallbladder removed through mouth in new surgical technique,"A new surgical technique called natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been used to remove a gallbladder through the mouth. The procedure was performed by lead investigator Santiago Horgan at the University of California, San Diego. The hope is that NOTES will reduce the risk of infection, pain, and abdominal scars compared to traditional laparoscopic surgery. The study aims to compare the costs between the two techniques, but no specific cost information is provided in the article. The article does not mention any potential harm or risks associated with the procedure or the use of this new technique over proven alternatives. It also does not provide any information about the effectiveness of gallbladder surgery or the cure rate for cancerous tumors in the gallbladder. The article states that NOTES requires a new set of skills for surgeons and may have a learning curve. It also mentions that the surgery still requires small incisions in the abdomen for increased visibility. The article does not provide any information about the length of time required under anesthesia, pre-surgery preparations, or the accuracy of the technique compared to others. The article does not mention the reasons why someone would have their gallbladder removed. The press release states that approximately 750,000 gallbladder removal surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. The article does not provide any independent sources or conflicts of interest. It briefly mentions three studies from the Cochrane Library that cast doubt on the idea that minimal is always better in surgery. Overall, the article lacks specific information about costs, benefits, potential harm, and the quality of evidence for the new surgical technique.",false,"This is what old news hands used to call a ""Hey, Martha!"" story, meaning that when someone reads it they will say, ""Hey, Martha! Can you believe this?"" As such, it makes sense for a news outlet to write about it, but at least some care should be taken to put this experimental procedure into the proper context. Even short items written as blog posts should be well reported, especially from a news organization as large and as influential as the Los Angeles Times. There is this assumption that minimally invasive surgeries are better simply because they require less cutting. In some cases this is true, but stories about minimally invasive techniques need to provide the evidence that they improve patient outcomes and that they are better than alternatives to surgery.This same type of thing happens among consumer electronics reporters. Smaller is always better. Except, who wants to listen to John Adams’ Century Rolls on ear buds that provide the sonic range of a toaster oven? And who wants to watch Avatar on a screen the size of a credit card?

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription.

Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire.

91,888,Singapore seizes ivory from nearly 300 elephants in record haul.,"Singapore authorities have seized a record-breaking amount of ivory, estimated to be worth $12.9 million, from nearly 300 African elephants. The ivory was being transported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Vietnam through Singapore. This seizure is the third major one of pangolin scales in Singapore this year. The pangolin, a highly trafficked mammal, is sought after for its meat, considered a delicacy in Vietnam and China, and its scales, used in traditional Chinese medicine. The Singapore Customs, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and the National Parks Board have stated that the seized pangolin scales and elephant ivory will be destroyed to prevent them from re-entering the market. The seizure was made after a tip-off from China's customs department. While the ivory haul falls just short of the largest ever seizure globally, which occurred in Vietnam in March, it is still a significant amount. There has been an increase in seizures of illegal wildlife products, including rhino horns, in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in recent months. Singapore, in particular, has been implicated in the global ivory trade due to its global connectivity and the presence of a small domestic market where pre-1990s ivory can be legally sold. This consistency of large-scale seizures suggests the involvement of organized crime in the illegal wildlife trade passing through or into Singapore. In addition to the ivory, the authorities also seized 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales, worth approximately $35.7 million. This amount is equivalent to close to 2,000 pangolins. Since April, Singapore has seized a total of 37.5 tonnes of pangolin scales, including one raid that was the largest of its kind worldwide in five years.

Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: Singapore authorities have seized a record-breaking amount of ivory, estimated to be worth $12.9 million, from nearly 300 African elephants. The ivory was being transported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Vietnam through Singapore. This seizure is the third major one of pangolin scales in Singapore this year. The pangolin, a highly trafficked mammal, is sought after for its meat, considered a delicacy in Vietnam and China, and its scales, used in traditional Chinese medicine.

The Singapore Customs, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and the National Parks Board have stated that the seized pangolin scales and elephant ivory will be destroyed to prevent them from re-entering the market. The seizure was made after a tip-off from China's customs department. While the ivory haul falls just short of the largest ever seizure globally, which occurred in Vietnam in March, it is still a significant amount.

There has been an increase in seizures of illegal wildlife products, including rhino horns, in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in recent months. Singapore, in particular, has been implicated in the global ivory trade due to its global connectivity and the presence of a small domestic market where pre-1990s ivory can be legally sold. This consistency of large-scale seizures suggests the involvement of organized crime in the illegal wildlife trade passing through or into Singapore.

In addition to the ivory, the authorities also seized 11.9 tonnes of pangolin scales, worth approximately $35.7 million. This amount is equivalent to close to 2,000 pangolins. Since April, Singapore has seized a total of 37.5 tonnes of pangolin scales, including one raid that was the largest of its kind worldwide in five years.

Singapore is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and claims to be committed to curbing the illegal wildlife trade. The authorities have been working to combat this issue, but the recent seizures highlight the ongoing challenges in preventing the trafficking of endangered species and their products.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:

That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20.

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Input:
Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The New York City Council has voted to add electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, to the city's Smoke-Free Air Act. If the mayor signs the bill, smoking e-cigarettes, also known as ""vaping,"" would be prohibited in public and private venues such as beaches, parks, restaurants, and office buildings. The bill was sponsored by City Council speaker, Christine Quinn, who believes that the public use of e-cigarettes threatens to undermine anti-smoking laws. E-cigarettes are slim, reusable metal tubes that contain nicotine-laced liquid in various flavors. When a user puffs on the device, the nicotine is heated and releases a vapor that does not contain tar, which is known to cause cancer and other diseases. Critics of the law argue that the ban would do more harm than good. Richard Carmona, a former U.S. Surgeon General and a board member at NJOY, one of America's largest electronic cigarette manufacturers, sent a letter to the council urging them to reject the bill. Carmona expressed concern that including e-cigarettes in the smoking ban could be a setback in the effort to defeat tobacco smoking. The debate over the risks versus benefits of e-cigarettes is ongoing, but a recent study published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, found that they are as effective as nicotine patches for smokers trying to quit. Three states - Utah, North Dakota, and New Jersey - have already passed legislation banning e-cigarettes wherever smoking is prohibited.

94,9816,Novel Stem Cell Treatment May Hold Promise for Type 1 Diabetes,"The article discusses a novel stem cell treatment that may hold promise for Type 1 diabetes. The treatment involves using stem cells to regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The article highlights a recent study conducted in China where 12 patients with Type 1 diabetes were treated with this stem cell therapy. The study found that the treatment was safe and resulted in a reduction in insulin use for the patients. However, the article raises concerns about the preliminary nature of the research and the lack of long-term data on the effectiveness of the treatment. It emphasizes that the study was designed to look for safety issues and did not assess long-term health outcomes or rates of complications associated with diabetes. The article cautions against making broad claims about the treatment's safety and effectiveness based on such limited evidence. The article also points out that the study only included patients with Type 1 diabetes, which is a rarer form of the disease. It notes that the treatment's potential benefits for the more common Type 2 diabetes are unknown. The article suggests that readers may have an inflated sense of the number of people for whom this research is relevant. The article acknowledges the inclusion of cautionary statements from an independent expert and the importance of providing context. However, it raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the lack of disclosure regarding funding sources. It mentions that the trial was funded by the University of Illinois but does not provide information on any potential financial entanglements.

Yet despite cautionary statements from an independent source, the story portrays a preliminary safety test as being much more than it is. The story also should have told readers that this approach to overcoming insulin resistance may not be relevant to the overwhelming majority of people with diabetes, who do not use insulin. It’s also a bit misleading for the story to call this a “clinical trial” since there were only 3 controls and 15 patients. The history of medical research is littered with examples of treatments that seemed highly beneficial when tested in small numbers of patients, but then turned out to cause serious harms or failed to sustain the benefits when tested in larger numbers of people. This test was so small that the patients were outnumbered by the authors of the journal article. It is simply too soon to put much stock in these preliminary findings.","The article discusses a novel stem cell treatment that may hold promise for Type 1 diabetes.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

It emphasizes that the study was designed to look for safety issues and did not assess long-term health outcomes or rates of complications associated with diabetes. The article cautions against making broad claims about the treatment's safety and effectiveness based on such limited evidence. The article also points out that the study only included patients with Type 1 diabetes, which is a rarer form of the disease. It notes that the treatment's potential benefits for the more common Type 2 diabetes are unknown. The article suggests that readers may have an inflated sense of the number of people for whom this research is relevant. The article acknowledges the inclusion of cautionary statements from an independent expert and the importance of providing context. However, it raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the lack of disclosure regarding funding sources. It mentions that the trial was funded by the University of Illinois but does not provide information on any potential financial entanglements.

95,5117,EPA boss visits polluted mining sites in Montana.,"Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler visited Butte and Anaconda in Montana with Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines. Wheeler stated that Superfund is a priority for the administration and that cleanup plans for both sites are still in progress and community input could shape the final agreement. Butte is home to the Berkeley Pit, an open-pit copper mine holding 50 billion gallons of acidic, metal-laden water. In 2016, 3,000 snow geese died after landing in the pit. Anaconda's environmental damage was caused by a century's worth of copper smelting that released arsenic, lead, and other metals into the air until 1980. Both communities were placed on the EPA's Superfund list in 1983. In June, EPA officials announced a ""conceptual"" cleanup plan for Butte, but details have not been made public due to a gag order imposed by a federal judge in a pollution lawsuit. In July, the agency reached a preliminary agreement over pollution in Anaconda with Atlantic Richfield Co., the state of Montana, and Anaconda-Deer Lodge County. Senator Daines has been urging the EPA to accelerate the cleanup projects and believes Wheeler's visit demonstrates the agency's willingness to work with the communities. A recent study by researchers from the University of South Carolina found that residents of Butte and Anaconda continue to die from cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other illnesses at higher rates than in other Montana counties.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study conducted by Medtronic that compared the use of insulin pumps to multiple daily injections for managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. The study found that the use of insulin pumps resulted in better control of blood sugar levels, as measured by the A1C test. The article mentions that the study was sponsored by Medtronic, the manufacturer of the insulin pump used in the study.

However, the article fails to mention important information about the study. It does not mention that the devices used in the study cost thousands of dollars and require ongoing purchases of supplies and services, which may or may not be covered by health insurance. The article also implies that the improved control of blood sugar levels reported by the researchers will reduce the risk of eye, kidney, and heart disease, even though these health outcomes were not measured in the study.

The article also fails to mention any potential harms of insulin pumps, such as the risk of infections at the site of pump insertion. The limitations and qualifications reported by the researchers in their article in the New England Journal of Medicine are also not mentioned. These include the fact that the trial included only people who were able to adequately control their blood sugar levels and that the results may not apply to people who manage their diabetes by other methods.

The article also does not mention the ties between the researchers and the manufacturers of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors. The disclosure summary included in the New England Journal of Medicine is 30 percent longer than the news report about the study. The article also fails to mention that the trial results apply only to people who are unable to achieve treatment goals with multiple daily insulin injections.

The article does mention that people with diabetes can manage blood glucose levels with multiple daily injections, but it fails to mention that patients who could successfully manage their blood sugar levels without a pump were excluded from the study. The article also does not mention that effective glucose management requires expert training and guidance, which may not be readily available in general clinical practice.

Overall, the article lacks important information about the costs, potential harms, limitations, and qualifications of insulin pumps, as well as the ties between the researchers and manufacturers. It also fails to mention that the trial results apply only to a specific group of people and that expert support services may be necessary for effective glucose management.

97,6559,Residents: Tests find toxic chemicals after Texas plant fire.,"Residents affected by the fire at the Arkema chemical plant in Texas have conducted scientific testing of samples and found toxic chemicals in the surrounding area. The residents' lawyers have accused Arkema of violating environmental protection laws due to unauthorized chemical spills and releases that occurred when the company failed to properly store and contain its organic peroxides before and after the facility was overwhelmed by six feet of water during Hurricane Harvey. The company has refused to disclose which chemicals were released during the fire and has been criticized for not providing information about its inventory quantities. Arkema is facing legal troubles, including a pending lawsuit and investigation by the civil attorney and criminal district attorney for Harris County. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and U.S. Chemical Safety Board are also investigating the incident. A group of homeowners and first responders are part of a state lawsuit seeking more than $1 million, blaming Arkema for their illnesses and failure to warn them about the hazards of breathing contaminated air. Arkema executives claim they had plans in place for flooding conditions, but the power and generators at the Crosby facility failed during Hurricane Harvey, causing the refrigeration systems to shut down and the organic peroxides to destabilize. The company abandoned the site and a mandatory evacuation zone was created. After containers storing hazardous materials caught fire and exploded, black plumes of smoke were released into the air. Scientific testing of samples collected both within and outside the evacuation zone found toxic chemicals, including volatile organic compounds and harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Some amount of dioxins and furans, which can change hormone levels, were also detected. The lawyers' letter states that the 1.5-mile evacuation zone was not sufficient to protect first responders and residents from the toxicity of the substances released. The exposure to the toxic mixture in the environment has caused bodily injury and the residents are calling for a community-wide remediation effort, changes in Arkema's operation, and a medical monitoring program to protect the public from risk. In 2016, an analysis by Texas A&M University researchers identified Arkema's facility as one of the biggest risks in a corridor with the highest concentration of petrochemical plants in the country.",true,"Tests detected toxic substances in soil, water and ash samples taken miles from a chemical plant that flooded during Hurricane Harvey, caught fire and partially exploded, nearly 20 Houston-area residents said Monday.","Residents affected by the fire at the Arkema chemical plant in Texas have conducted scientific testing of samples and found toxic chemicals in the surrounding area.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""false"",""explanation"":""A Facebook post claims the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are healthy wear face masks to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

98,2917,FDA approves AstraZeneca type 2 diabetes drug.,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the type 2 diabetes drug, dapagliflozin, which will be sold in the United States under the brand name Farxiga. The drug was co-developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca. It belongs to a class of diabetes drugs called SGLT-2 inhibitors, which work by blocking reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increasing its excretion through urine to lower blood sugar levels. Farxiga will compete with a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson called Invokana, as well as other diabetes medicines. Analysts predict that Farxiga could reach annual sales of about $1.5 billion by 2018. The drug is expected to take market share from older diabetes treatments that cause weight gain, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to lead to weight loss in clinical trials. The potential market for type 2 diabetes treatments is large, with an estimated 90 to 95 percent of the more than 370 million people living with diabetes worldwide having type 2. Many type 2 diabetes patients require multiple medications to control their blood sugar levels. Farxiga was tested in combination with several other widely used medicines. The FDA initially rejected the drug in 2012 due to concerns about possible cancer and heart risks, but the companies provided additional data that addressed those concerns. However, as a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring six post-marketing studies, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial and a study to assess bladder cancer risk. The FDA-approved label for Farxiga states that the drug should not be used in patients with kidney disease or who are being treated for bladder cancer.",true,U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved an AstraZeneca drug from a new class of medicines to treat type 2 diabetes after previously rejecting it over safety concerns.,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the type 2 diabetes drug, dapagliflozin, which will be sold in the United States under the brand name Farxiga.

The potential market for type 2 diabetes treatments is large, with an estimated 90 to 95 percent of the more than 370 million people living with diabetes worldwide having type 2. Many type 2 diabetes patients require multiple medications to control their blood sugar levels. Farxiga was tested in combination with several other widely used medicines. The FDA initially rejected the drug in 2012 due to concerns about possible cancer and heart risks, but the companies provided additional data that addressed those concerns. However, as a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring six post-marketing studies, including a cardiovascular outcomes trial and a study to assess bladder cancer risk. The FDA-approved label for Farxiga states that the drug should not be used in patients with kidney disease or who are being treated for bladder cancer.","### Instruction:

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that suggests Celebrex, a pain reliever, may help prevent colon cancer. The story mentions that Celebrex is more expensive than other pain relievers and reports the benefits of the drug in statistical terms. However, it fails to provide the number of advanced polyps prevented in each group and does not explain that the difference in polyp incidence may not directly translate to the number of actual cancers prevented. The article also notes that Celebrex users have a higher risk of developing polyps once they stop taking the drug, but only describes the cardiovascular risk in relative terms. It should have provided the absolute rate of cardiovascular problems in both groups to help readers understand the overall risk. The story is generally restrained in its reporting, mentioning caveats and limitations of the study. However, it fails to explain that polyps are a surrogate endpoint and that most polyps do not progress to cancer. The article also mentions the global incidence of colorectal cancer without specifying that it is not specific to the United States. The study was funded by Pfizer, the maker of Celebrex, but includes commentary from an independent expert. The article suggests that most people should rely on colonoscopies for early detection of colorectal cancer rather than taking Celebrex. It also mentions that aspirin is being studied for its potential cancer prevention effects. The article notes that Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor available in the US and that it requires a prescription. It acknowledges previous research on the potential of COX-2 inhibitors to prevent cancer and is not based on a press release.
Claim: Celebrex may curb colon cancer, but with caveats

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This story about Celebrex’s potential to prevent colorectal cancer satisfied most of our criteria and gives readers the correct bottom line on this study. The story should have taken a bit more care to explain that the investigators were looking at a surrogate outcome, and it could have quantified the harms of treatment more precisely. But even in the areas where it fell short, the story did end up providing enough information to advance the reader’s understanding. As the story points out, screening via colonoscopy does not always catch polyps before they have a chance to progress to cancer. Drugs that can reduce the number of polyps that develop in the first place (e.g. Celebrex and aspirin) might therefore have a role to play in prevention efforts, especially in individuals at high risk. The challenge is to balance this potential benefit against the well established risk of adverse effects with these medications (i.e. heart problems with Celebrex and gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin). At present, there isn’t enough evidence that the benefits of treatment outweigh the harms for most people.""}

Context: The claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated and incorrect. The CDC's guidance has changed since then. Initially, the CDC advised against wearing face masks unless individuals had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. However, on April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC was revising its recommendations on face coverings. The CDC now recommends that nearly everyone wear a cloth face covering when out in public and where social distancing is difficult.

The new guidance from the CDC does not differentiate between people who are healthy and people who have symptoms, as the claim suggests. The CDC broadly recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings where maintaining a six-feet distance is challenging. This includes places like grocery stores and pharmacies, especially in areas with widespread COVID-19 illness.

The purpose of wearing a cloth face covering is not to protect the wearer but to prevent the spread of the virus from the wearer to others. This is particularly important because the virus can be transmitted by people who are asymptomatic or who have not yet developed symptoms. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or common materials, but surgical masks or N-95 respirators should be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.

The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and create a tight seal around the wearer's face. Thin or porous fabrics are less likely to be effective. It is important to treat cloth masks as contaminated materials and launder them in hot soapy water regularly. Sanitizing with bleach or hydrogen peroxide may also be necessary.

In summary, the claim that the CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks is outdated. The CDC now advises nearly everyone to wear a cloth face covering in public settings where social distancing is difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
Claim: The CDC recommends that only people with COVID-19 symptoms should wear masks.

### Response:

That was the CDC’s advice — until a change made April 3. Now, to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, the CDC recommends nearly everyone wear a face covering when out in public and where social distancing is more difficult.""}

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the possibility of postponing the 2020 U.S. presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It states that the pandemic has already resulted in the curtailment of social gatherings and severely impacted businesses. The postponement of primary elections in some states has raised concerns about the November election. The article explores the question of whether the U.S. could delay the election until pandemic-related restrictions are eased.

However, it highlights the difficulty and lack of flexibility in delaying the election. The Electoral College system used in the United States means that the president is chosen through electors selected in 50 different state elections. Federal law mandates that all electors be appointed on a specific date, which is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The sitting president does not have the power to unilaterally change this date.

The article mentions that individual states could potentially change the method of selecting electors, but this would require approval from state legislatures and governors in all 50 states. It also states that such a course of action would be difficult to accomplish in time and unpopular with voters.

Another option would be for both houses of the U.S. Congress to pass a law modifying the Presidential Election Day Act to establish a new date. However, given the current polarized state of U.S. politics, the chances of achieving this in a timely manner are unlikely.

Even if the election could be delayed, there is limited leeway. The 20th amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that the current president's term ends at noon on January 20. Delaying the election by more than two months would risk leaving the U.S. without a president or vice president, requiring the Speaker of the House to temporarily govern while a solution is found.

In conclusion, while it is possible to delay the U.S. presidential election, it would be challenging and unpopular. The current federal law and constitutional provisions make it difficult to change the election date, and the polarized state of U.S. politics further complicates the situation.
Claim: The 2020 U.S. presidential election could be postponed if the coronavirus pandemic threatens to keep people from voting.

### Response:
{""veracity"":""mixture"",""explanation"":""What's true: The date of a U.S. presidential election could theoretically be postponed with the approval of Congress and the president. What's false: However, such a postponement would be extremely difficult to achieve in time for the 2020 presidential election and would not provide much temporal leeway for voters.""}

Context: An Egyptian masseur named Abdel Rehim Saeid uses an ancient Pharaonic technique called the ""fiery towel"" to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves starting with a standard massage using oil and camomile to stimulate blood circulation. Then, Saeid places several layers of towels and isolating materials on the client's back, followed by a towel soaked in alcohol that is set on fire. The towel burns for about a minute before being extinguished with a wet towel. Saeid claims that this technique works by sucking moisture out of the body and that he communicates with the human body during the massage.

Saeid received training in the fiery towel technique from an expert in Morocco and has earned several massage certifications from institutions in Egypt. However, he cannot use this technique on people with high blood pressure, kidney failure, or haemophilia.

One of Saeid's clients, Mohammed al-Shaer, reported a significant improvement in his pain after the fiery treatment. Al-Shaer stated that before the treatment, he was unable to stand to pray or stretch his back after getting out of a car. However, after just two sessions, his body is getting better, and his movement has improved. He also mentioned that he used to be very lazy, but that is no longer the case.

In summary, Abdel Rehim Saeid, an Egyptian masseur, uses the fiery towel technique to alleviate muscle pain. The technique involves a standard massage followed by placing layers of towels and a towel soaked in alcohol on the client's back, which is then set on fire. Saeid claims that this technique works by removing moisture from the body. One of his clients reported a significant improvement in pain and increased mobility after the treatment.

Context: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the type 2 diabetes drug, dapagliflozin, which will be sold in the United States under the brand name Farxiga. The drug was co-developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca. It belongs to a class of diabetes drugs called SGLT-2 inhibitors, which work by blocking reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increasing its excretion through urine to lower blood sugar levels. Farxiga will compete with a similar drug from Johnson & Johnson called Invokana, as well as other diabetes medicines. Analysts predict that Farxiga could reach annual sales of about $1.5 billion by 2018. The drug is expected to take market share from older diabetes treatments that cause weight gain, as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to lead to weight loss in clinical trials. The potential market for type 2 diabetes treatments is large, with an estimated 90 to 95 percent of the more than 370 million people living with diabetes worldwide having type 2.

99,7422,White House moves toward promoting face masks to fight virus.,"The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus through speaking, as recent information suggests that it can be transmitted even when people are not coughing or sneezing. However, the recommendation is not intended to take away masks from healthcare providers who are in direct contact with infected patients. Medical-grade masks, especially N95 masks, will be reserved for those dealing directly with the sick. President Donald Trump indicated his support for the recommendation, and his latest coronavirus test came back negative. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern that the mask guidance could lead to a false sense of security for Americans. The discussions on face masks occurred as the White House defended its handling of the pandemic and its efforts to distribute ventilators and protective equipment to medical professionals. The White House also considered direct payments to hospitals to cover COVID-19 treatment costs for the uninsured. The emerging guidance on masks is expected to be more limited than a draft from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggested that the recommendation apply to nearly all Americans. The new proposal is driven by research showing that some infections are being spread by seemingly healthy people. Previously, only the sick or those at high risk of complications were advised to wear masks. The CDC recently changed its definition of the risk of infection for Americans, stating that anyone may be considered a carrier, whether or not they have symptoms.

Context: The claim states that 66 A&E and maternity wards have been closed. However, it is mentioned in the article that this information is not collected nationally, so there is no exact data on the number of closures. In 2014, there were plans to close or downgrade 66 wards in England, but it is unclear how many have actually been closed.

Overall, the claim cannot be fully supported or refuted due to the lack of comprehensive data on the closure of A&E and maternity wards.

### Input:
Context: The White House is considering recommending that Americans wear nonmedical masks, T-shirts, or bandannas to cover their nose and mouth when they go outside, particularly in areas hard hit by community transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to prevent the spread of the virus through speaking, as recent information suggests that it can be transmitted even when people are not coughing or sneezing. However, the recommendation is not intended to take away masks from healthcare providers who are in direct contact with infected patients. Medical-grade masks, especially N95 masks, will be reserved for those dealing directly with the sick. President Donald Trump indicated his support for the recommendation, and his latest coronavirus test came back negative. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, expressed concern that the mask guidance could lead to a false sense of security for Americans. The discussions on face masks occurred as the White House defended its handling of the pandemic and its efforts to distribute ventilators and protective equipment to medical professionals. The White House also considered direct payments to hospitals to cover COVID-19 treatment costs for the uninsured. The emerging guidance on masks is expected to be more limited than a draft from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggested that the recommendation apply to nearly all Americans. The new proposal is driven by research showing that some infections are being spread by seemingly healthy people. Previously, only the sick or those at high risk of complications were advised to wear masks. The CDC recently changed its definition of the risk of infection for Americans, stating that anyone may be considered a carrier, whether or not they have symptoms. The virus primarily spreads through droplets from coughs or sneezes, but there is still uncertainty about whether it can also spread through smaller aerosolized particles. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that the general population does not need to wear masks unless they are sick or caring for someone who is sick.
Claim: White House moves toward promoting face masks to fight virus.
