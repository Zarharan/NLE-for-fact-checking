0,295,WHO recommends one-hour maximum screen time per day for under-5s.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life. The WHO advises that children between the ages of one and four should spend at least three hours participating in various physical activities throughout the day. Infants under one should engage in floor-based play and avoid all screens. The organization warns against excessive use of electronic screens with young children. The WHO emphasizes that preventing obesity and related diseases should start in early life, as being inactive contributes to the rising numbers of overweight and obese individuals worldwide. Currently, 40 million children under the age of five are overweight, with 50 percent of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. This translates to 5.9 percent of children globally. The WHO guidelines are based on evidence from numerous studies, many of which were conducted in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. The organization highlights that sedentary behaviors, such as using motorized transport instead of walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, and playing inactive screen-based games, are associated with poor health outcomes. Chronic insufficient sleep in children has also been linked to increased fat accumulation. Shorter sleep duration is often associated with more screen time and playing computer games.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.
Claim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.

### Response:

According to the department, no reports of attempted abductions or unwanted solicitations in local parking lots had been received.""}

Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines recommending that children under the age of five should have limited screen time and engage in physical activity and adequate sleep to prevent obesity and other diseases later in life. The WHO advises that children between the ages of one and four should spend at least three hours participating in various physical activities throughout the day. Infants under one should engage in floor-based play and avoid all screens. The organization warns against excessive use of electronic screens with young children. The WHO emphasizes that preventing obesity and related diseases should start in early life, as being inactive contributes to the rising numbers of overweight and obese individuals worldwide. Currently, 40 million children under the age of five are overweight, with 50 percent of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. This translates to 5.9 percent of children globally. The WHO guidelines are based on evidence from numerous studies, many of which were conducted in Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. The organization highlights that sedentary behaviors, such as using motorized transport instead of walking or cycling, sitting at a desk in school, and playing inactive screen-based games, are associated with poor health outcomes. Chronic insufficient sleep in children has also been linked to increased fat accumulation. Shorter sleep duration is often associated with more screen time and playing computer games. The WHO's guidelines aim to promote healthy habits and lifestyle routines during early childhood, a period of rapid physical and cognitive development. The organization stresses the importance of addressing these issues early on to prevent premature death from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain forms of cancer.

1,11286,Stem cell experiment lets diabetics forgo insulin,"A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years. The main finding of the research is that the experimental treatment seems to cure diabetes in these patients. However, the broadcast fails to mention the cost of the procedure or project any potential costs. It does highlight the potential dangers of the procedure, such as infections resulting from the suppression of the immune system. The broadcast does not mention the possibility that the remarkable findings could be due to chance or bias, as pointed out by the researchers themselves. The findings will need to be validated through randomized studies that compare the new treatment to standard care or a placebo, and follow patients for a longer period of time. The broadcast does not explain this. There is no evidence of disease-mongering in the broadcast, as it presents a balanced view from cautious researchers, an academic ethicist, and a mother of a child with Type I diabetes. The broadcast also highlights the current standard of care for Type I diabetes, which involves insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It shows a young girl managing her disease through this routine, illustrating the hardships and discipline required. The broadcast emphasizes that the stem cell therapy is experimental and not widely available. While the broadcast suggests that this form of stem cell therapy is new, similar treatments for Type I diabetes have been experimented with since the 1990s. There is no obvious use of text from a press release in the broadcast.",true,"The NBC broadcast nicely contrasts the demands that glucose monitoring and insulin shots impose on Type I diabetes patients with the tremendous uncertainty associated with experimental stem cell treatments that might free patients from these daily routines. It summarizes the treatment’s apparent benefits and potential harms, as well as ethical concerns about exporting research on dangerous treatments to countries such as Brazil where patients may not fully understand the risks. If the broadcast has a weakness, it is that it fails to mention the limitations inherent in any small, nonrandomized, nonblinded study with short follow-up that investigates a new treatment in patients with a chronic disease requiring lifelong care. (See “Evidence” above.)

It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A recent broadcast discusses a stem cell experiment that has allowed 14 out of 15 patients with Type I diabetes to no longer require insulin shots for up to three years. The main finding of the research is that the experimental treatment seems to cure diabetes in these patients. However, the broadcast fails to mention the cost of the procedure or project any potential costs. It does highlight the potential dangers of the procedure, such as infections resulting from the suppression of the immune system. The broadcast does not mention the possibility that the remarkable findings could be due to chance or bias, as pointed out by the researchers themselves. The findings will need to be validated through randomized studies that compare the new treatment to standard care or a placebo, and follow patients for a longer period of time. The broadcast does not explain this. There is no evidence of disease-mongering in the broadcast, as it presents a balanced view from cautious researchers, an academic ethicist, and a mother of a child with Type I diabetes. The broadcast also highlights the current standard of care for Type I diabetes, which involves insulin injections and daily glucose monitoring. It shows a young girl managing her disease through this routine, illustrating the hardships and discipline required. The broadcast emphasizes that the stem cell therapy is experimental and not widely available. While the broadcast suggests that this form of stem cell therapy is new, similar treatments for Type I diabetes have been experimented with since the 1990s. There is no obvious use of text from a press release in the broadcast.

The article then focuses on two entrepreneurs who have capitalized on the demand for fresh air. Moses Lam, the founder of Vitality Air, sells cans of fresh air collected from Banff National Park in Canada. He has customers in China, India, South Korea, and Vietnam.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the issue of air pollution in China and how it has led to the sale of fresh air in various forms. It mentions that in February 2016, bottles of fresh air were being sold to Chinese customers as a relief from air pollution. The New York Times reported that Beijing officials listed smog as a natural disaster, causing controversy and concerns that it would reduce pressure on officials to fix the problem. The article also highlights the high levels of fine particulate air pollution, known as PM2.5, in Beijing and the surrounding region, which far exceed the World Health Organization's guidelines. 

The article then focuses on two entrepreneurs who have capitalized on the demand for fresh air. Moses Lam, the founder of Vitality Air, sells cans of fresh air collected from Banff National Park in Canada. He has customers in China, India, South Korea, and Vietnam. Lam mentions that pollution and sales of his product go hand in hand, with a spike in sales during the winter months when pollution worsens due to heating and coal burning. 

Leo De Watts, the founder of AethAer, sells empty-looking jars filled with air from pristine parts of Great Britain. The article notes that these products may be bought more as novelty or collector's items rather than practical sources of clean air. 

The article also mentions a Chinese philanthropist, Chen Guangbiao, who handed out cans of fresh air as a political statement about the environment. He emphasized the need to prioritize the ecological environment over GDP growth and profits.

Overall, the article highlights the severity of air pollution in China and how it has led to the sale of fresh air in various forms. It also mentions the concerns and controversies surrounding the classification of smog as a natural disaster and the impact it may have on efforts to address the problem.
Claim: Chinese people are selling each other bags of fresh air because of air pollution.

3,10054,Study Suggests Special MRI Might Help Diagnose Autism,"A recent study suggests that a special type of MRI could potentially be used to diagnose autism. The study found that there were differences in brain activity between typical children and children with autism in the language comprehension area. However, the article notes that these differences may not be exclusive to autism and that a larger study group may have included subjects with similar brain activity who were not diagnosed as autistic. The article also mentions that there are no quantified or mentioned harms associated with an inaccurate diagnosis of autism. The limitations of the study are acknowledged, such as the fact that it was conducted on school-aged children and that it is unknown if the same differences in neuroimaging would be found in younger patients. The article emphasizes that the technique of using MRIs to diagnose autism is unproven and not widely applicable. The expertise of the radiologist is also mentioned as a factor in the validity of the testing. The article concludes that there is still much work to be done before MRIs can be used as a screening device for autism.",true,"If it had spent a little more time quantifying the potential benefits of this screening, and if it had discussed any of the potential harms, it would have earned a higher rating. MRIs are being touted as a breakthrough screening for a range of conditions, with promises that “early intervention” will save lives and eliminate suffering. For this to be true, studies have to be properly designed and have to target the right population of patients. The study in question here does neither well, and the story does a decent job capturing the uncertainty around the study’s findings.","A recent study suggests that a special type of MRI could potentially be used to diagnose autism.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The video in question, which shows the aftermath of a school prank involving spiked lemonade, is not real. It was uploaded to the website LiveLeak in mid-September 2018 and gained millions of views on Facebook. However, the footage is actually taken from the Netflix mockumentary television series American Vandal. The show is a satirical take on true crime documentaries and focuses on juvenile pranks and acts of vandalism in a high school setting.

The second season of American Vandal, which premiered shortly before the viral video, features an episode called ""Brown Out."" In this episode, students at the fictional St. Bernardine prep school in Bellevue, Washington, are poisoned by laxative-tainted lemonade and suffer from mass defecation. The opening sequence of this episode, which shows the students soiling themselves, was described as disgusting by The New Yorker.

Some of the footage from the viral hoax video can also be seen in a trailer for the second season of American Vandal. This confirms that the video is not a real incident but a staged scene from the show.

In summary, the claim that the video captures real students suffering from diarrhea after a prank involving spiked lemonade is false. The video is actually a scene from the Netflix mockumentary series American Vandal, which depicts fictional events in a high school setting.
Claim: A video shows the aftermath of a school prank in which a student spiked lemonade with laxatives.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The article discusses a study on the drug iloprost and its potential to prevent lung cancer. The study found that iloprost showed significant improvement in ""endobronchial dysplasia,"" which is a change in lung tissue. However, the study did not assess whether the subjects ultimately developed lung cancer or not. The article also mentions that the study enrolled individuals at increased risk of lung cancer due to abnormal cells in their sputum, not just smokers and ex-smokers.

The article then moves on to discuss a study on the drug erlotinib, which is sold as Tarceva. The study found that erlotinib maintenance therapy showed promising results for patients with advanced lung cancer. However, the article does not provide any caveats or context for the studies discussed, leading readers to believe that all three studies mentioned are of equal high quality.

The article also fails to mention that the erlotinib study was funded by a drug company and that the FDA approved Tarceva for maintenance therapy based on the results of the study, despite controversy and a negative recommendation from the FDA's advisory panel.

The article does not provide any independent sources or voices to add context or evaluate the studies. It also does not mention any conflicts of interest. The story gets a marginal satisfactory rating as it does mention that iloprost is not currently approved for the prevention of lung cancer and that erlotinib is sold as Tarceva.

Overall, the article lacks important information and context, and does not provide a comprehensive and unbiased view of the studies discussed.

6,8780,New antibody drug helps cells kill blood cancer.,"A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer. In a Phase I trial, all seven patients who received the highest dose of blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The drug works by binding cancer cells to cytotoxic T-cells, allowing them to effectively kill the tumor without causing uncontrolled T-cell activity. This is a significant breakthrough as scientists have struggled to find a way to trigger a T-cell attack against tumors. Micromet Inc, the company developing blinatumomab, hopes to conduct a pivotal clinical trial next year to gain regulatory approval. The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL. Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue. Overall, the results of the Phase I trial for blinatumomab in NHL are promising and provide hope for patients with previously incurable blood cancer.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A new antibody drug called blinatumomab has shown promising results in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), a previously incurable form of blood cancer. In a Phase I trial, all seven patients who received the highest dose of blinatumomab showed either complete or partial responses. The drug works by binding cancer cells to cytotoxic T-cells, allowing them to effectively kill the tumor without causing uncontrolled T-cell activity. This is a significant breakthrough as scientists have struggled to find a way to trigger a T-cell attack against tumors. Micromet Inc, the company developing blinatumomab, hopes to conduct a pivotal clinical trial next year to gain regulatory approval.

The Phase I trial for NHL involved 38 patients who were given varying doses of blinatumomab. Of those, 11 patients who received higher dosages showed major responses and tumor regression, even without additional chemotherapy. The drug targets a protein called CD19 and has shown to be effective in activating T-cells only in contact with tumor cells, making it a conditional and controlled response. The side effects of blinatumomab were mostly observed in the first week of treatment and usually normalized. The amount of drug needed for treatment was much lower compared to existing antibody treatments for NHL.

Blinatumomab is also being tested in mid-stage Phase II clinical trials for acute lymphocytic leukemia. AstraZeneca has marketing rights for the drug in North America. Micromet Inc is optimistic about the potential of blinatumomab and believes that the low doses required for treatment will not pose a significant cost issue.

Overall, the results of the Phase I trial for blinatumomab in NHL are promising and provide hope for patients with previously incurable blood cancer. The drug's ability to activate T-cells in a controlled manner without causing excessive T-cell activity is a significant advancement in cancer treatment. Micromet Inc plans to conduct further clinical trials to gain regulatory approval for blinatumomab.

Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The claim states that a teenage girl was drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working on behalf of sex traffickers. However, the article explains that this claim is likely a classic urban legend. 

The article mentions that on June 20, 2015, a Facebook user shared a screenshot of a text message describing a harrowing near miss abduction effort that supposedly occurred in the bathroom of a Dillard's department store in Denton, Texas. The text message claimed that two girls hid in the bathroom, pinned down the daughter, and injected her with black laced heroin, paralyzing her. The two girls then claimed that the daughter was their drunk friend and they were taking her home. The post also mentioned that these two girls worked for sex trafficking in Denton.

The article points out that this claim is similar to other messages spread on social media about kidnappers working on behalf of sex traffickers. These messages often lack verifiable documentation and rely on the ""friend of a friend"" narrative. The article mentions other instances of similar claims, such as a warning about abductors in an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store and warnings about human traffickers targeting college kids through job interviews.

Local police quickly responded to the claim and stated that they could not find any report to substantiate it. They considered it a rumor or hoax and continued to investigate. Facebook users commenting on the post by the City of Denton Police Department linked to an article about human trafficking raids in Denton. However, the police clarified that the article was from July 2014, indicating that it was not related to the recent claim.

In summary, the claim of a teenage girl being drugged and nearly abducted in a Dillard's department store by fellow teens working for sex traffickers is likely an urban legend. The lack of verifiable documentation and the similarity to other social media warnings about sex trafficking suggest that this claim is not true. Local police also stated that they could not find any evidence to support the claim.

The woman was released on bail and was scheduled to appear in court.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The Guggenheim Museum in New York planned to host an exhibition called ""Art and China after 1989,"" which featured three installations that were criticized for animal cruelty. The installations included a video showing dogs strapped to treadmills and forced to run without touching each other, a video showing pigs with letters stamped on them having sex, and a table covered in a dome containing insects and reptiles. The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted its supplemental application and granted priority review to Imfinzi for the treatment of previously untreated late-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The FDA decision is a boost for the treatment as it competes against similar medicines from rivals Merck and Roche, and follows data in September which showed Imfinzi prolonged survival in SCLC patients when used with chemotherapy. AstraZeneca has already carved out a niche for Imfinzi, which boosts the body’s immune system to fight cancer cells, in the more common cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with an existing approval for use in situations where tumors have only spread in the chest. The FDA in March approved Roche’s immunotherapy Tecentriq for the treatment of SCLC. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo is also approved in cases where patients fail at least two other treatments. A final decision to approve Imfinzi for SCLC is expected in the first quarter of 2020, AstraZeneca said.

11,22336,David Prosser Says Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg’s record as a state Justice Department lawyer consists only of the prosecution of cases regarding regulation of docks.,"The article discusses a claim made by Justice David Prosser during a debate with his opponent, JoAnne Kloppenburg, for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Prosser stated that Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer in the state Department of Justice only involved the prosecution of cases regarding the regulation of docks. Prosser argued that his own experience as a district attorney and lawmaker made him more qualified for the position. The article examines the validity of Prosser's claim by looking at the cases handled by Kloppenburg during her time at the Department of Justice. Prosser's campaign provided evidence of 46 cases involving Kloppenburg, with 76% of them related to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). However, only five of these cases dealt directly with docks. The Kloppenburg campaign provided a list of 17 published decisions of cases she argued before the state Appeals Court, none of which involved docks. They also mentioned that Kloppenburg had argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts and before the state Supreme Court, with few, if any, involving docks or piers. Prosser later admitted that he was aware of the breadth of cases handled by Kloppenburg and that his comment about docks was a ""rhetorical flourish."" However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent Kloppenburg's record. Prosser's comment aligns with attacks from Kloppenburg's critics in the campaign, suggesting that it was not meant as a joke. In conclusion, the article finds that Prosser's claim about Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer is false.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a claim made by Justice David Prosser during a debate with his opponent, JoAnne Kloppenburg, for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Prosser stated that Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer in the state Department of Justice only involved the prosecution of cases regarding the regulation of docks. Prosser argued that his own experience as a district attorney and lawmaker made him more qualified for the position.

The article examines the validity of Prosser's claim by looking at the cases handled by Kloppenburg during her time at the Department of Justice. Prosser's campaign provided evidence of 46 cases involving Kloppenburg, with 76% of them related to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). However, only five of these cases dealt directly with docks. The Kloppenburg campaign provided a list of 17 published decisions of cases she argued before the state Appeals Court, none of which involved docks. They also mentioned that Kloppenburg had argued hundreds of cases in circuit courts and before the state Supreme Court, with few, if any, involving docks or piers.

Prosser later admitted that he was aware of the breadth of cases handled by Kloppenburg and that his comment about docks was a ""rhetorical flourish."" However, the article argues that this claim is false because it does not accurately represent Kloppenburg's record. Prosser's comment aligns with attacks from Kloppenburg's critics in the campaign, suggesting that it was not meant as a joke.

In conclusion, the article finds that Prosser's claim about Kloppenburg's record as a lawyer is false. Kloppenburg handled a much broader range of cases during her time at the Department of Justice, and Prosser's comment was not meant as a joke but as a line of attack against his opponent.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that Walt Disney arranged to have himself frozen in a cryonic chamber upon his death is not supported by any documentary evidence. The article provides information that contradicts this claim. Walt Disney's health had been deteriorating, and he entered the hospital for tests in November 1966. Doctors discovered a cancerous spot on his left lung and removed it. His health continued to decline, and he died two weeks later on December 15, 1966. There is no evidence to suggest that Disney was interested in or aware of cryonics. The article mentions that cryonics research was being discussed in scientific and general press during the late 1950s and early 1960s, but there is no documentation to suggest that Disney had any interest in the subject. Claims about Disney's interest in cryonics primarily come from questionable sources, such as biographies that have been discredited for containing factual errors and undocumented assertions. Disney's daughter, Diane, wrote in 1972 that there was no truth to the rumor that her father wished to be frozen and doubted that he had ever heard of cryonics. Available documentation indicates that Disney was cremated, which is consistent with his publicly stated wish to not have a funeral. The article also addresses other rumors surrounding Disney's death, such as the delay in announcing his death and the secrecy surrounding his funeral. These rumors are debunked with explanations that are consistent with ordinary circumstances and Disney's own preferences. Overall, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Walt Disney arranged to have himself frozen in a cryonic chamber.

14,6360,Judge: Treatment of Tennessee inmates with hep C improving.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160. The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment. Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider. The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases. Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population. Judge Crenshaw emphasized the importance of implementing the 2019 HCV Guidance and accelerating the approval of inmates for treatment to avoid future claims of inadequate treatment.",true,A federal judge in Nashville ruled this week that Tennessee’s treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C is not grossly inadequate but warned the state to make good on its promises to treat more patients more quickly.,"U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones.

The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has ruled that Tennessee has made improvements in the treatment of inmates with hepatitis C. The state has recently made changes to improve the treatment of the disease, which has caused at least 56 prisoner deaths between 2013 and 2017. The availability of antiviral drugs that can cure the disease has been a challenge for prisons due to their high cost, which is over $10,000 per patient. In Tennessee, a committee must approve all prescriptions for the expensive antiviral medications, resulting in a limited number of prisoners receiving treatment. However, the Tennessee Department of Correction is working to increase the number of cases considered each month from eight to 160.

The ruling acknowledges the prisoners' testimony about not receiving crucial drugs even when they qualified for treatment. Previously, the committee would only consider treatment for patients who were already very sick, but the current standard of care is to treat anyone infected with hepatitis C with antiviral medications, regardless of their level of sickness. Delaying treatment can put patients at greater risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. The new guidelines released by the department prioritize the sickest patients but do not exclude less sick patients from receiving treatment.

Other states have also faced challenges in providing expensive hepatitis C treatment. Michigan recently agreed to provide antiviral treatment to all Medicaid patients with hepatitis C, while Louisiana limited treatment until earlier this summer but now offers unlimited access through an agreement with a drug provider.

The Tennessee Department of Correction's prioritization guidance aligns with that of the federal Bureau of Prisons. The cost of antiviral drugs has significantly decreased since they became available in 2011, from around $80,000 to about $13,000 for simpler cases.

Dr. Kenneth Williams, the Correction Department's chief medical officer, testified that he has received enough funding to treat about 1,800 inmates, which is more than a third of the infected population. Judge Crenshaw emphasized the importance of implementing the 2019 HCV Guidance and accelerating the approval of inmates for treatment to avoid future claims of inadequate treatment.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.
Claim: West Nile virus confirmed in miniature horse in Pine City.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that hand sanitizer will do nothing for the coronavirus is incorrect. Health officials recommend the use of hand sanitizer to kill the coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, but if that is not accessible, using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is recommended. While hand sanitizers are not effective against all viruses, those with high alcohol content have proven effective against some, including human coronaviruses.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative.

19,12694,It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care.,"U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, has been critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but opposed his party's health care plan. Yoho claims that the ACA has driven people to Medicaid, a program he describes as a worldwide failure. However, when asked for evidence to support his claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world, Yoho's spokesman walked back the statement, saying that Yoho meant to point out that health care trends have not improved since the implementation of the ACA. Experts interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. While Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, research about outcomes comes with caveats. Medicaid recipients start out sicker, and healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care. Yoho referred to two articles by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, to support his claim. One article discussed a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon, which found that recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Another article by Cass cited a Harvard study that compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine, and New York with other states that made no change. The study found that only New York achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, the study's author, Ben Sommers, has since done additional research and found that deaths from treatable causes did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study found that differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals are not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. However, more research is needed to determine the effects on health outcomes. In conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence.

However, the study's author, Ben Sommers, has since done additional research and found that deaths from treatable causes did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well.

Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study found that differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals are not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care.

Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. However, more research is needed to determine the effects on health outcomes.

In conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence. While there are studies that suggest Medicaid may not significantly improve physical health outcomes, it does improve access to care and self-reported health. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of Medicaid on health outcomes.","### Instruction:

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, has been critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) but opposed his party's health care plan. Yoho claims that the ACA has driven people to Medicaid, a program he describes as a worldwide failure. However, when asked for evidence to support his claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world, Yoho's spokesman walked back the statement, saying that Yoho meant to point out that health care trends have not improved since the implementation of the ACA.

Experts interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. While Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, research about outcomes comes with caveats. Medicaid recipients start out sicker, and healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care.

Yoho referred to two articles by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, to support his claim. One article discussed a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon, which found that recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health.

Another article by Cass cited a Harvard study that compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine, and New York with other states that made no change. The study found that only New York achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, the study's author, Ben Sommers, has since done additional research and found that deaths from treatable causes did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well.

Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study found that differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals are not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care.

Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. However, more research is needed to determine the effects on health outcomes.

In conclusion, Yoho's claim that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world is not supported by evidence. While there are studies that suggest Medicaid may not significantly improve physical health outcomes, it does improve access to care and self-reported health. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of Medicaid on health outcomes.

20,22298,"We’re paying out-of-state residential facilities hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more,"" to house children in state custody","State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment. DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times. The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs. DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements. Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: State Rep. Roberto DaSilva has introduced legislation aimed at making it more difficult for the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to send children in its care to out-of-state residential treatment facilities. DaSilva was inspired by the story of Nicholas Alahverdian, who experienced abuse and neglect in two out-of-state facilities where he was placed by the DCYF. Alahverdian has since formed a nonprofit organization to advocate for children in DCYF care and has filed lawsuits related to his mistreatment.

DaSilva believes that Rhode Island has the resources to provide necessary treatment for children within the state and is concerned about both the well-being of children in state care and keeping taxpayer dollars in Rhode Island. He argues that it doesn't make sense to spend large sums of money on out-of-state residential facilities, especially during challenging economic times.

The DCYF has stated that it is working to reduce its reliance on residential treatment programs, both within Rhode Island and in other states. However, the agency's expenditures show that a significant amount of money is still being spent on out-of-state placements. The Rhode Island DCYF Transparency Portal reveals that in fiscal year 2010, the state spent $117 million on residential care for youth in DCYF custody, including costs for foster home placements and community services. While some of this money went to local services, millions of dollars were allocated to out-of-state programs.

DCYF interim Director Kevin J. Aucoin provided additional data, stating that in the current fiscal year, the agency expects to spend $65.5 million on residential services for 718 children, with $9.5 million going to out-of-state facilities. Aucoin claims that spending on residential programs has been decreasing, with $85.4 million spent in fiscal year 2007 for 1,102 children, including $18.4 million for out-of-state placements.

Aucoin explains that children are sent out of state for specialized treatments not available in Rhode Island, such as multiple psychiatric diagnoses, severe developmental disabilities, and severe aggressive behaviors. Placement out of state requires approval from the Family Court and demonstration by the agency that there are no adequate in-state programs.

In conclusion, DaSilva's claim that the state spends ""hundreds of thousands"" on out-of-state residential facilities is conservative. The DCYF expects to spend nearly $10 million on out-of-state programs, indicating that his concern about the expenditure of taxpayer dollars is valid.

21,10103,"Antibiotics speed up recovery from ear infections in young children, studies show","Two studies have found that antibiotics can speed up recovery from ear infections in young children. The studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that children who were given antibiotics had a higher rate of symptom relief after 7 days compared to those who were given a placebo. The absolute rate of symptom relief was 80% for the antibiotic-treated patients and 74% for the placebo-treated patients. The studies also found that antibiotics were more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis. These findings support current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to children with ear infections. The article provides expert commentary on the benefits of antibiotics for ear infections, as well as the risks and likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don't receive antibiotics. It emphasizes the importance of putting the benefits of antibiotics into context and considering the risk of harm. The article also mentions that limiting antibiotic use can increase the chance that future use of antibiotics will be effective. The article does not discuss the costs of antibiotic prescriptions to the individual or the costs of policies on the healthcare system and society. It is noted that more detail on the findings from the studies would have been useful, as well as a quantitative estimate of the benefits of antibiotics if available.

It is based on the findings of two independent studies and provides valuable expert commentary.",true,"Of four stories we reviewed on this study (Washington Post blog, NPR, Los Angeles Times as well), two were blog pieces – this one and the Washington Post entry. This CNN effort was better in most ways than the opinionated blog from the Washington Post. It earned points for sticking to the evidence and providing independent perspectives about the value of antibiotics for treating childhood ear infections. We also applaud the story’s focus on shared decision-making between doctors and parents when managing ear infections. A bit more detail on costs and harms would have added value to this excellent story. Wanting the best for a child with an ear infection doesn’t necessarily mean opting for the most aggressive treatment. As Dr Richard Rosenfeld puts it in this story: “Medicine is about gray zones and balancing the risks and benefits. Parents and doctors need to understand what the benefits and what the downside of treatments are.” While the research discussed here confirms that antibiotics are likely to be beneficial for certain children with ear infections, no study can take the place of a careful consideration of individual circumstances.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: Two studies have found that antibiotics can speed up recovery from ear infections in young children. The studies, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that children who were given antibiotics had a higher rate of symptom relief after 7 days compared to those who were given a placebo. The absolute rate of symptom relief was 80% for the antibiotic-treated patients and 74% for the placebo-treated patients. The studies also found that antibiotics were more effective for infants and toddlers with a conclusive ear infection diagnosis. These findings support current U.S. guidelines for providing immediate antibiotics to children with ear infections.

The article provides expert commentary on the benefits of antibiotics for ear infections, as well as the risks and likelihood of spontaneous recovery in children who don't receive antibiotics. It emphasizes the importance of putting the benefits of antibiotics into context and considering the risk of harm. The article also mentions that limiting antibiotic use can increase the chance that future use of antibiotics will be effective.

The article does not discuss the costs of antibiotic prescriptions to the individual or the costs of policies on the healthcare system and society. It is noted that more detail on the findings from the studies would have been useful, as well as a quantitative estimate of the benefits of antibiotics if available. The article is praised for not engaging in disease-mongering and for featuring independent voices, including comments from Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, an expert in evidence-based treatment of ear infections.

Overall, the article takes a careful approach to examining the evidence and supports the use of antibiotics for infants and toddlers with ear infections. It is based on the findings of two independent studies and provides valuable expert commentary.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The Guggenheim Museum in New York planned to host an exhibition called ""Art and China after 1989,"" which featured three installations that were criticized for animal cruelty. The installations included a video showing dogs strapped to treadmills and forced to run without touching each other, a video showing pigs with letters stamped on them having sex, and a table covered in a dome containing insects and reptiles. The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article claims that a story about the potential use of Viagra to treat heart symptoms of muscular dystrophy fails to provide important information and context. The story does not mention the high cost of treatment for pulmonary hypertension patients who use the Revatio brand of sildenafil, which can exceed $15,000 a year. It also does not mention the potential side effects of sildenafil, such as vision and hearing loss, chest pain, and shortness of breath. The story fails to provide specific data about the mice used in the study and does not mention that the continual administration of sildenafil over many months is more similar to the way the drug is used in patients with pulmonary hypertension, rather than the occasional doses used to treat erectile dysfunction. The article also criticizes the story for not interviewing any researchers or independent experts and for not providing information about how heart problems in patients with muscular dystrophy are currently managed or how sildenafil treatment compares to standard therapy. The story is also criticized for leading with old news and not putting the latest study in the proper context of other experiments. Overall, the article argues that the story lacks important information and context, and fails to properly inform readers about the potential use of Viagra to treat heart symptoms of muscular dystrophy.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

26,11330,Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk,"The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The study involved 899 participants who were followed for an average of 9 years. During the study, 99 people developed dementia, resulting in a total incidence of dementia of 11%. The article mentions that consuming two or more servings of fish per week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%. However, it notes that this is a relative risk reduction and does not provide the absolute risk of developing dementia, which would be necessary to put the relative risk reduction into context. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil, had a lower risk of developing dementia. Plasma DHA levels were seen to correlate with the number of servings of fish or the amount of DHA consumed. The article also mentions potential harms from fish oil consumption and speculates on potential harms from fish consumption. It suggests that other behaviors associated with reduced dementia, such as social activities or better dietary variety, may be more common in those who eat more fish, potentially confounding the results. The article points out that neither DHA nor fish oil supplements have FDA approval for the prevention of dementia. It also mentions that DHA is found in fatty fish and fish oil supplements, but curiously includes ""some meats"" as a source of DHA. However, DHA is primarily found in significant quantities in the brain, retina, and testes, which are not frequently consumed by people. Overall, the article reports on the findings of the study and includes quotes from the study's senior author and an editorial about the research. It does not appear to rely on a press release and does not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer's disease.",mixture,"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it is information that a reader should be aware of. The headline of the story – ""Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk"" – is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled ""Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease"" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study that found a potential link between fish oil and a lower risk of developing dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. The study involved 899 participants who were followed for an average of 9 years. During the study, 99 people developed dementia, resulting in a total incidence of dementia of 11%.

The article mentions that consuming two or more servings of fish per week reduced the risk of dementia by 39%. However, it notes that this is a relative risk reduction and does not provide the absolute risk of developing dementia, which would be necessary to put the relative risk reduction into context.

The study found that individuals with the highest levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid found in fish oil, had a lower risk of developing dementia. Plasma DHA levels were seen to correlate with the number of servings of fish or the amount of DHA consumed.

The article also mentions potential harms from fish oil consumption and speculates on potential harms from fish consumption. It suggests that other behaviors associated with reduced dementia, such as social activities or better dietary variety, may be more common in those who eat more fish, potentially confounding the results.

The article points out that neither DHA nor fish oil supplements have FDA approval for the prevention of dementia. It also mentions that DHA is found in fatty fish and fish oil supplements, but curiously includes ""some meats"" as a source of DHA. However, DHA is primarily found in significant quantities in the brain, retina, and testes, which are not frequently consumed by people.

Overall, the article reports on the findings of the study and includes quotes from the study's senior author and an editorial about the research. It does not appear to rely on a press release and does not mention the lack of evidence-based measures to prevent Alzheimer's disease.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The claim that if masks prevent coronavirus, governors in New York, Michigan, and California would have given them to prison inmates instead of releasing them is inaccurate. Medical experts agree that face coverings help slow the spread of the virus, and the states mentioned in the claim have distributed masks to inmates. Additionally, the claim suggests that all released inmates pose a threat to kill, which is an exaggeration. In response to the coronavirus, more inmates are being released from local jails than from prisons, and states are considering the potential danger to the public when deciding which inmates to release. In New York, pregnant women with nonviolent offenses and inmates held for low-level parole violations were released. Michigan is releasing nonviolent offenders over the age of 60 with health issues, and California is expediting the transition to parole for nonviolent offenders with less than 60 days left on their sentences. 

Correctional and detention facilities face unique challenges in combating COVID-19, as inmates live, work, and eat in close settings, increasing the potential for the virus to spread. Across the country, over 25,000 prison inmates have tested positive for COVID-19, and more than 370 have died. In response to outbreaks, staff and inmates are required to wear masks in New York, Michigan, and California prisons. The CDC recommends the use of facial coverings, including homemade masks, to slow the spread of the virus. A May 15 CDC report recommends cloth facial coverings, along with other measures, for correctional facilities.

In conclusion, the claim that governors would have given masks to prison inmates if they prevent coronavirus is inaccurate. Masks have been distributed to inmates in the mentioned states, and inmates are being released as a measure to limit the spread of COVID-19, primarily focusing on nonviolent offenders or those who are not seen as a safety threat.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

30,12749,On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.,"Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. Williams initially stated that he would not seek life without parole for individuals under 18, but a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that his stance had changed. Williams responded with a letter to the editor, stating that his approach is consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court. The article explains that the issue of juvenile lifers became complicated when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision, which prohibited mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles, would apply retroactively. This led to a process of resentencing individuals across the state, with judges having the final determination on each case. The Inquirer reported that Williams' office intends to seek life without parole for at least three of the cases it has reviewed so far. Williams' chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, stated that while Williams hopes not to have many juvenile murderers remain in custody, there are certain circumstances, such as heinous crimes, where life without parole may be necessary. PolitiFact questioned whether this move conflicts with Williams' previous statements that all 300 individuals would have a chance at parole. Martin argued that the judge would have the final determination, but this contradicts what the DA's office is requesting. The article concludes by stating that Williams' original goal was to give all juvenile lifers some chance of parole, but in the most heinous cases, this goal may not be met. The DA's office argues that Williams' stance has not changed, as he always acknowledged that there could be exceptions. Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding Williams' stance on parole for juvenile lifers and the discrepancy between his previous statements and the actions of his office.",false,"District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal ""to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel"" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that ""we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically"" and that ""they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole."" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.","Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams has been criticized for allegedly reversing his stance on offering the chance of parole to individuals convicted of homicide as juveniles. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional. Williams initially stated that he would not seek life without parole for individuals under 18, but a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer suggested that his stance had changed. Williams responded with a letter to the editor, stating that his approach is consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court.

The article explains that the issue of juvenile lifers became complicated when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision, which prohibited mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles, would apply retroactively. This led to a process of resentencing individuals across the state, with judges having the final determination on each case.

The Inquirer reported that Williams' office intends to seek life without parole for at least three of the cases it has reviewed so far. Williams' chief of staff, Kathleen Martin, stated that while Williams hopes not to have many juvenile murderers remain in custody, there are certain circumstances, such as heinous crimes, where life without parole may be necessary.

PolitiFact questioned whether this move conflicts with Williams' previous statements that all 300 individuals would have a chance at parole. Martin argued that the judge would have the final determination, but this contradicts what the DA's office is requesting.

The article concludes by stating that Williams' original goal was to give all juvenile lifers some chance of parole, but in the most heinous cases, this goal may not be met. The DA's office argues that Williams' stance has not changed, as he always acknowledged that there could be exceptions.

Overall, the article highlights the controversy surrounding Williams' stance on parole for juvenile lifers and the discrepancy between his previous statements and the actions of his office.
Claim: On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: A Medicare kickbacks scheme in the San Francisco Bay Area has resulted in criminal charges against multiple individuals and companies. The scheme involved Amity Home Health Care, its CEO, and Advent Care Inc., a hospice service provider, along with doctors, nurses, marketers, and a social worker. The criminal complaints allege that Amity provided $8 million worth of kickbacks, including items such as Golden State Warriors tickets, trips to Las Vegas, Louis Vuitton handbags, and even envelopes of cash, in exchange for patient referrals. The Medicare patients brought in $115 million in funds to Amity and Advent.

Law enforcement officers recorded each defendant offering, approving, or accepting illegal payments for patient referrals. The FBI's deputy special agent in charge for San Francisco, Craig Fair, stated that the defendants prioritized their own financial gains over the well-being of their patients, betraying the principles of their profession. However, there is no evidence that the patients received poor care.

Among those charged is Ridhima ""Amanda"" Singh, the CEO of Amity. Singh's lawyer declined to comment on the case. A representative from Advent declined to comment as well. If convicted of participating in illegal kickbacks, the defendants could face up to 10 years in federal prison and a $100,000 fine.

The article does not provide further details about the specific actions of the defendants or the investigation process. It focuses primarily on the charges and the potential consequences for those involved in the kickbacks scheme.

33,9272,Asthma pill could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers,"The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers. However, the release lacks important information such as the cost of the drug compared to other asthma treatments currently in use. The release also fails to provide quantification of the results of the clinical tests and does not mention any potential side effects of the drug. The full research paper, which is behind a paywall, includes a table of adverse events experienced by patients in the study. The release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data regarding the reduction of eosinophil in sputum. However, it falls short in providing other indicators that would have strengthened it. The release includes funding sources but fails to mention any linkages between the study's authors and pharmaceutical firms, which is important for readers to ascertain bias. There is also no mention of alternative treatments for asthma or a comparison with current approaches. The release claims that the asthma pill is the first new one in nearly 20 years, but this is incorrect as several new drugs have come on the market in recent years. The release includes a conservative headline but allows the main researcher to proclaim the drug as a ""game changer"" and includes a testimonial from a study participant. The release also fails to include commentary from two unaffiliated experts, which would have improved its value.",false,"This release explains the results of a small clinical trial testing whether the use of a new drug, fevipiprant, would be effective in reducing the serious symptoms of asthma. It does a good job of reporting data on the primary goal of the research and then slips when suggesting the research had other positive outcomes but fails to provide any data backing that up. The release is further weakened by its inclusion of what is basically a testimonial for the new drug by one of the participants in the study. And it fails to mention either costs or possible harms from using the drug, and ignores some rather substantial conflicts of interest among the investigators. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says more than 22 million Americans have asthma, including about 6 million children. There are many more millions with the condition worldwide. A daily pill that might alleviate serious symptoms of the disease, or even prevent asthma attacks, would be a boon to public health, especially considering some of the shortcomings of other current treatments. New medications to treat the underlying problem, namely airway inflammation, are needed and would translate into improved health for this very common and sometimes serious medical problem. This release may have helped spawn two news stories that we also reviewed that had glaringly different story framing. One was by Reuters and the other by Medical Daily. The latter of the two didn’t offer “anything beyond what is in the news release,” according to reviewers.","The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article discusses a press release about a potential new asthma pill that could reduce symptoms in severe sufferers. However, the release lacks important information such as the cost of the drug compared to other asthma treatments currently in use. The release also fails to provide quantification of the results of the clinical tests and does not mention any potential side effects of the drug. The full research paper, which is behind a paywall, includes a table of adverse events experienced by patients in the study. The release does a good job of explaining the nature of the research and the resulting data regarding the reduction of eosinophil in sputum. However, it falls short in providing other indicators that would have strengthened it. The release includes funding sources but fails to mention any linkages between the study's authors and pharmaceutical firms, which is important for readers to ascertain bias. There is also no mention of alternative treatments for asthma or a comparison with current approaches. The release claims that the asthma pill is the first new one in nearly 20 years, but this is incorrect as several new drugs have come on the market in recent years. The release includes a conservative headline but allows the main researcher to proclaim the drug as a ""game changer"" and includes a testimonial from a study participant. The release also fails to include commentary from two unaffiliated experts, which would have improved its value.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing.

### Input:
Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.
Claim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.

### Input:
Context: A powerful earthquake struck the Turkey-Iran border region, resulting in the deaths of nine people and injuring over 100 others. Three of the deceased were children, and nine individuals are in critical condition. The quake caused over 1,000 buildings to collapse in Turkey, leading to a rescue effort to find those trapped under the rubble. The tremor also damaged buildings in the Turkish city of Van and several villages in Iran. In Iran, 75 people were injured, with six requiring hospitalization. Following the initial earthquake, there were several aftershocks, including a larger tremor measuring 6.0 magnitude. No immediate reports of damage or casualties were received from the subsequent quake. Both Iran and Turkey are prone to earthquakes due to their location on major fault lines. Turkish TV footage showed people using shovels and their hands to dig through the rubble, while damaged buildings, fallen roofs, and cracked walls were observed in various villages. The governor of Van confirmed the loss of life and widespread destruction in the affected areas. The earthquake had a depth of 5 km and struck at 8:53 a.m. The second significant quake occurred at 7:00 p.m. Dozens of villages in Turkey were rattled, and nearly 150 tents were sent to provide shelter for affected families. The Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority initiated rescue operations in villages near the epicenter. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter to be 47 km west of the Iranian city of Khoy. Last month, another earthquake in eastern Turkey caused over 40 fatalities, while an earthquake in Iran caused structural damage to homes without resulting in any deaths. Rescue teams have been dispatched to the affected area in Iran's West Azarbaijan province, where several towns and villages suffered significant damage.

36,5367,TravelLab: Adults take over science museums when night falls.,"Science museums are hosting adult sleepovers, allowing grown-ups to explore the exhibits and learn about science in a unique and immersive way. The trend started at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which capitalized on the popularity of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. The sleepovers have become a hot ticket, with other science centers and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, and elsewhere following suit. During the sleepovers, guests have the opportunity to explore the museum's permanent exhibition halls, join guided tours, visit the planetarium, and meet with curators and museum scientists. The experience allows adults to experience the museum in a special way, without the crowds and rush of a typical visit during the day. The sleepovers also provide a chance for adults to have fun and embrace their inner child. Some attendees dress up in dinosaur costumes or onesies, adding to the playful atmosphere. The sleepovers typically include dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and guests can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum's cots, located below a 94-foot-long blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The sleepovers also have a scientific purpose. The quiet and stillness of the nighttime environment allows visitors to better absorb and learn from the exhibits. Biologist John Karavias explains that during the day, visitors often feel rushed and only get superficial reactions to the exhibits. At night, however, the background noise is quieted down, allowing visitors to digest the science behind what they are seeing. The sleepovers also provide an opportunity for museum staff to educate guests about important scientific topics. For example, visitors learn about the effects of climate change on marine life, such as the impact of ocean acidification on starfish and sea urchins. They also learn about animals that glow and the hidden language they use to communicate with each other.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: Science museums are hosting adult sleepovers, allowing grown-ups to explore the exhibits and learn about science in a unique and immersive way. The trend started at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which capitalized on the popularity of the ""Night at the Museum"" movies. The sleepovers have become a hot ticket, with other science centers and museums in Atlanta, Milwaukee, Portland, and elsewhere following suit. 

During the sleepovers, guests have the opportunity to explore the museum's permanent exhibition halls, join guided tours, visit the planetarium, and meet with curators and museum scientists. The experience allows adults to experience the museum in a special way, without the crowds and rush of a typical visit during the day. 

The sleepovers also provide a chance for adults to have fun and embrace their inner child. Some attendees dress up in dinosaur costumes or onesies, adding to the playful atmosphere. The sleepovers typically include dinner in a room full of moon rocks and a 15-ton meteorite, and guests can sleep in their own sleeping bags or the museum's cots, located below a 94-foot-long blue whale hanging from the ceiling. 

The sleepovers also have a scientific purpose. The quiet and stillness of the nighttime environment allows visitors to better absorb and learn from the exhibits. Biologist John Karavias explains that during the day, visitors often feel rushed and only get superficial reactions to the exhibits. At night, however, the background noise is quieted down, allowing visitors to digest the science behind what they are seeing. 

The sleepovers also provide an opportunity for museum staff to educate guests about important scientific topics. For example, visitors learn about the effects of climate change on marine life, such as the impact of ocean acidification on starfish and sea urchins. They also learn about animals that glow and the hidden language they use to communicate with each other. 

Overall, the sleepovers provide a unique and educational experience for adults, allowing them to have fun, learn about science, and experience the museum in a special way.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The UK government has enlisted firefighters to assist in the response to the coronavirus crisis. Under a deal struck between the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), fire chiefs, and Fire and Rescue Employers, firefighters will continue to respond to emergencies but will also carry out new tasks. These tasks include collecting bodies in the event of mass casualties, driving ambulances, and delivering food and medicine to vulnerable individuals. The move comes as the UK has implemented stringent controls to prevent the spread of the virus, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordering a virtual lockdown of the country. As of now, there have been 578 deaths and 11,658 confirmed cases in the UK. The country currently has the seventh highest death toll in the world. To cope with the outbreak, the UK has asked retired doctors and healthcare workers to return to work, and hundreds of thousands of people have volunteered to assist the National Health Service. The capital's ambulance service and police force have also appealed to former staff to come back and help. However, there has been criticism that the government has been slow in providing protective equipment to frontline healthcare staff, and it is also struggling to source enough ventilators to treat severe breathing problems caused by the virus. The government has admitted that it missed an opportunity to join a European Union procurement scheme for equipment due to a communication issue. Despite these challenges, Britons have shown support for healthcare workers by applauding them from their balconies and front doors.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

In a campaign event on January 31, Biden criticized Trump's ""hysterical xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration's policy. He emphasized the need for science to guide the response to the crisis.

Biden has used the word ""xenophobic"" in reference to Trump on multiple occasions, but not directly in relation to the China travel policy. An April ad from the Trump campaign selectively edited a clip of Biden to make it seem like he complimented Trump for the travel restrictions. However, in the full context, Biden was actually criticizing Trump for not acting urgently enough.

In conclusion, there is no evidence to support Trump's claim that Biden wrote a letter of apology for calling the travel restrictions xenophobic. Biden's campaign spokesman denied the existence of such a letter, and there is no public record of it. While Biden has used the word ""xenophobic"" to describe Trump, it was not directly in reference to the China travel policy.","### Instruction:

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: President Donald Trump claimed during a virtual town hall with Fox News that former Vice President Joe Biden had written a letter of apology for calling Trump's travel restrictions from China ""xenophobic."" However, there is no evidence to support this claim. Biden's campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, stated that it ""never happened."" There is no public record of any letter of apology from Biden on Twitter, Google, or the Nexis news archive database. Other fact-checkers and political reporters have also concluded that no such letter exists.

On January 31, the Trump administration announced temporary travel restrictions from China due to the coronavirus outbreak. Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, later expressed Biden's support for these restrictions in a statement to CNN on April 3. However, Biden never explicitly called the travel restrictions xenophobic. In a campaign event on January 31, Biden criticized Trump's ""hysterical xenophobia"" but did not specifically mention the administration's policy. He emphasized the need for science to guide the response to the crisis.

42,3386,New York tries to keep alive flavored e-cigarette ban.,"The state of New York is attempting to extend its ban on flavored e-cigarettes for another 90 days. The ban, which went into effect in September, prohibits the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, with the exception of menthol and tobacco flavors. The state's Public Health and Health Planning Council voted to renew the regulations, citing concerns about the health risks of vaping and its popularity among teenagers. The ban was initially blocked by a state appeals court in October, but the council wants to ensure that the emergency regulations remain in place if the courts uphold the ban. The Department of Health spokesperson expressed confidence that the court will recognize the public health emergency and the need for immediate action. The ban has faced criticism from opponents, including the Vapor Technology Association, who argue that it is government overreach and will harm small businesses and adult smokers who use flavors to quit. Supporters, such as the American Cancer Society's advocacy group, are pushing for the ban to be made permanent and for all flavored tobacco to be prohibited. Governor Andrew Cuomo has also expressed his intention to expand the ban to include menthol. Anti-tobacco and anti-vaping groups argue that there is no scientific basis for exempting menthol and that it has been unethically marketed towards African Americans. They also warn that mint and menthol flavors can still attract young people to e-cigarettes by masking the harshness of nicotine. In addition to the state ban, New York City Council has passed its own bill banning flavored vaping products, including menthol, which is expected to take effect in July 2020.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The state of New York is attempting to extend its ban on flavored e-cigarettes for another 90 days. The ban, which went into effect in September, prohibits the sale of flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products, with the exception of menthol and tobacco flavors. The state's Public Health and Health Planning Council voted to renew the regulations, citing concerns about the health risks of vaping and its popularity among teenagers. The ban was initially blocked by a state appeals court in October, but the council wants to ensure that the emergency regulations remain in place if the courts uphold the ban. The Department of Health spokesperson expressed confidence that the court will recognize the public health emergency and the need for immediate action. The ban has faced criticism from opponents, including the Vapor Technology Association, who argue that it is government overreach and will harm small businesses and adult smokers who use flavors to quit. Supporters, such as the American Cancer Society's advocacy group, are pushing for the ban to be made permanent and for all flavored tobacco to be prohibited. Governor Andrew Cuomo has also expressed his intention to expand the ban to include menthol. Anti-tobacco and anti-vaping groups argue that there is no scientific basis for exempting menthol and that it has been unethically marketed towards African Americans. They also warn that mint and menthol flavors can still attract young people to e-cigarettes by masking the harshness of nicotine. In addition to the state ban, New York City Council has passed its own bill banning flavored vaping products, including menthol, which is expected to take effect in July 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported over 2,400 cases of lung illnesses and 52 deaths nationwide attributed to vaping, with laboratory findings suggesting that products containing vitamin E or THC have played a major role in the outbreak.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

44,35289,"Under U.S. President Donald Trump, federal authorities are confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","The article discusses the claim that under President Donald Trump, federal authorities have been confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim is supported by various news reports and accounts from healthcare officials and leaders. The article mentions Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Massachusetts, who published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine detailing his experience with federal interference in obtaining a large shipment of face masks and respirators. He stated that before he could send the funds for the shipment, two FBI agents arrived and questioned him. After assuring them that the PPE was intended for hospitals, the agents allowed the equipment to be released. However, the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting the supplies, but intervention from a congressional representative prevented their seizure. The Los Angeles Times also reported that healthcare officials in seven states claimed that the federal government seized their PPE shipments without providing guidance on when or if they would receive the supplies they ordered. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that FEMA intervened in a deal the city had with a supplier to buy 1 million masks. A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government. The article mentions additional reports of federal interference in PPE procurement. Massachusetts state leaders confirmed a large order of PPE for healthcare workers, but the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, a hospital system had an agreement to receive four shipments of medical gear, but FEMA commandeered the supplies. Colorado Governor Jared Polis believed his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were taken by FEMA. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker expressed concerns that discussing how his state obtained masks and gloves could lead to federal officials seizing the materials.

The Department of Homeland Security did not provide a comment on the matter.",true,"What's true: Numerous health care officials and state leaders have reported instances in which federal authorities have intervened on local agencies' agreements with PPE vendors. In several cases, state officials reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) confiscated supplies within the last minute of deals with no explanation, while others reported the agency outbid them for the equipment. What's false: However, FEMA does not appear to have an organized effort for commandeering equipment at the local level. Agency representatives said they are working under a broad distribution plan to get supplies to areas in highest need.","The article discusses the claim that under President Donald Trump, federal authorities have been confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim is supported by various news reports and accounts from healthcare officials and leaders.

The article mentions Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Massachusetts, who published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine detailing his experience with federal interference in obtaining a large shipment of face masks and respirators. He stated that before he could send the funds for the shipment, two FBI agents arrived and questioned him. After assuring them that the PPE was intended for hospitals, the agents allowed the equipment to be released. However, the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting the supplies, but intervention from a congressional representative prevented their seizure.

The Los Angeles Times also reported that healthcare officials in seven states claimed that the federal government seized their PPE shipments without providing guidance on when or if they would receive the supplies they ordered. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that FEMA intervened in a deal the city had with a supplier to buy 1 million masks. A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government.

The article mentions additional reports of federal interference in PPE procurement. Massachusetts state leaders confirmed a large order of PPE for healthcare workers, but the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, a hospital system had an agreement to receive four shipments of medical gear, but FEMA commandeered the supplies. Colorado Governor Jared Polis believed his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were taken by FEMA. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker expressed concerns that discussing how his state obtained masks and gloves could lead to federal officials seizing the materials.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article discusses the claim that under President Donald Trump, federal authorities have been confiscating orders of personal protective equipment (PPE) from local governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The claim is supported by various news reports and accounts from healthcare officials and leaders.

The article mentions Dr. Andrew W. Artenstein, an infectious disease physician in Massachusetts, who published a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine detailing his experience with federal interference in obtaining a large shipment of face masks and respirators. He stated that before he could send the funds for the shipment, two FBI agents arrived and questioned him.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that FEMA intervened in a deal the city had with a supplier to buy 1 million masks. A New Jersey county official and a leader of the private healthcare company Kaiser Permanente also reported that their PPE orders were commandeered by the federal government.

The article mentions additional reports of federal interference in PPE procurement. Massachusetts state leaders confirmed a large order of PPE for healthcare workers, but the Trump administration took control of the shipments. In Kentucky, a hospital system had an agreement to receive four shipments of medical gear, but FEMA commandeered the supplies. Colorado Governor Jared Polis believed his state had secured 500 ventilators before they were taken by FEMA. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker expressed concerns that discussing how his state obtained masks and gloves could lead to federal officials seizing the materials.

The article concludes by stating that the supply chain for PPE has been described as chaotic and competitive, with federal officials allegedly seizing shipments and disrupting deals between vendors and states. The FBI declined to comment on specific accounts of interference, but stated that they were working to prevent unlawful distribution or hoarding of PPE during the pandemic. The Department of Homeland Security did not provide a comment on the matter.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

47,30528,"Before his death, physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith after a visit with Pope Francis.","The claim that physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith before his death is false. Hawking was a well-known atheist who often spoke about his views on the origins of the universe and the lack of a divine Creator. He did not believe in an afterlife or heaven, stating that he regarded the brain as a computer that would stop working when its components fail. There is no evidence to suggest that Hawking deviated from these views before his death or made any declaration of faith after meeting with Pope Francis. The photograph in the Facebook post showing Hawking and Pope Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016 is genuine, but the claim that Hawking requested a private visit with the pontiff is false. Hawking traveled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, of which he was a valued member. The academy aims to foster interaction between faith and reason and encourage dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical, and religious values. After Hawking's death, the academy honored him by tweeting photographs of him meeting various popes, including Pope Francis. However, despite his commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself. The claim of Hawking's deathbed conversion to Christianity is part of a long series of similar hoaxes. Similar claims have been made about other prominent atheists, such as writer Christopher Hitchens, Charles Darwin, and astronomer Carl Sagan. These claims have been widely dismissed and criticized by friends and colleagues of the individuals involved.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith before his death is false. Hawking was a well-known atheist who often spoke about his views on the origins of the universe and the lack of a divine Creator. He did not believe in an afterlife or heaven, stating that he regarded the brain as a computer that would stop working when its components fail. There is no evidence to suggest that Hawking deviated from these views before his death or made any declaration of faith after meeting with Pope Francis.

The photograph in the Facebook post showing Hawking and Pope Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016 is genuine, but the claim that Hawking requested a private visit with the pontiff is false. Hawking traveled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, of which he was a valued member. The academy aims to foster interaction between faith and reason and encourage dialogue between science and spiritual, cultural, philosophical, and religious values.

After Hawking's death, the academy honored him by tweeting photographs of him meeting various popes, including Pope Francis. However, despite his commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith, Hawking remained an unbeliever himself.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The total number of deaths in Italy due to the coronavirus has risen to 107, with 28 deaths occurring in the past 24 hours. As a result, the Education Minister has announced the closure of all schools and universities in the country from Thursday until at least March 15. Previously, only schools in the heavily affected northern regions had been closed. The number of confirmed cases in Italy has risen to 3,089, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.5%. The government has implemented a decree to slow down the spread of the virus, which includes the suspension of events that involve large gatherings of people and the closure of cinemas and theaters. Italians are also advised to avoid physical contact with others, including shaking hands and hugging. Major sporting events, including Serie A soccer matches, will be played in empty stadiums. The closure of schools has received mixed reactions from parents, with some expressing relief to prevent the spread of the virus among children, while others find it tragic for both students and parents. The virus outbreak is primarily concentrated in the Lombardy region, but cases are spreading throughout the country. The economic impact of the outbreak is significant, with the tourist sector experiencing a wave of cancellations. The industry is expected to suffer a loss of about 7.4 billion euros ($8.23 billion) due to a drop in the number of tourists. The government has promised tax breaks and other measures worth 3.6 billion euros to support affected sectors, with the possibility of increasing this amount to 4.5 billion euros.

49,1382,Regulator grants license for Britain's first three-parent IVF babies.,"The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in the UK has granted a license to a team of doctors in Newcastle to carry out the mitochondrial pronuclear transfer technique, which could result in the birth of the first child created in Britain using this method by the end of the year. The technique involves removing faulty mitochondria, which can cause serious health problems, from embryos and replacing them with healthy mitochondria from a female donor. This process is known as ""three-parent"" IVF because the resulting babies would have DNA from a mother, a father, and a female donor.

The decision to grant the license has been welcomed by the medical team at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, who believe it will provide hope for families affected by these devastating diseases. The UK has been at the forefront of scientific advances and ethical debates regarding pro-nuclear transfer techniques. However, it is not the first country to have children born using three-parent IVF treatment, as the world's first known mitochondrial transfer baby was born in 2016 with the help of US doctors at a clinic in Mexico.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

The HFEA will still need to approve each clinic and patient on an individual basis before the treatment can be performed. Overall, the decision to grant the license for three-parent IVF babies in the UK has been met with both praise and criticism, highlighting the ongoing ethical debate surrounding this technique.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses a study conducted by Medtronic that compared the use of insulin pumps to multiple daily injections for managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. The study found that the use of insulin pumps resulted in better control of blood sugar levels, as measured by the A1C test. The article mentions that the study was sponsored by Medtronic, the manufacturer of the insulin pump used in the study.

However, the article fails to mention important information about the study. It does not mention that the devices used in the study cost thousands of dollars and require ongoing purchases of supplies and services, which may or may not be covered by health insurance. The article also implies that the improved control of blood sugar levels reported by the researchers will reduce the risk of eye, kidney, and heart disease, even though these health outcomes were not measured in the study.

The article also fails to mention any potential harms of insulin pumps, such as the risk of infections at the site of pump insertion. The limitations and qualifications reported by the researchers in their article in the New England Journal of Medicine are also not mentioned. These include the fact that the trial included only people who were able to adequately control their blood sugar levels and that the results may not apply to people who manage their diabetes by other methods.

The article also does not mention the ties between the researchers and the manufacturers of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors. The disclosure summary included in the New England Journal of Medicine is 30 percent longer than the news report about the study. The article also fails to mention that the trial results apply only to people who are unable to achieve treatment goals with multiple daily insulin injections.

The article does mention that people with diabetes can manage blood glucose levels with multiple daily injections, but it fails to mention that patients who could successfully manage their blood sugar levels without a pump were excluded from the study. The article also does not mention that effective glucose management requires expert training and guidance, which may not be readily available in general clinical practice.

Overall, the article lacks important information about the costs, potential harms, limitations, and qualifications of insulin pumps, as well as the ties between the researchers and manufacturers. It also fails to mention that the trial results apply only to a specific group of people and that expert support services may be necessary for effective glucose management.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is not true. The claim originated from a fake news website called Huzlers, which is known for publishing satirical and fictional stories. The website itself states that it is a fake news and satire entertainment website. Therefore, the claim is not based on factual information.

Furthermore, the world suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, so it would be impossible to determine if Paul's video had any impact on the suicide rate within a few days. The video was uploaded on December 31, 2017, and the suicide rate does not change so quickly.

Logan Paul's video titled ""We Found A Dead Body in Japan's Suicide Forest"" received widespread condemnation. The video featured footage of a man who had recently taken his own life. Paul faced backlash from the public, his fans, and mental health advocates. He later apologized for the video.

Suicide is a serious issue in Japan, particularly in the so-called suicide forest that Paul visited. Japan records over 20,000 suicide deaths annually. However, the suicide rate in Japan has been declining in recent years due to prevention efforts by Japanese officials.

The most recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the suicide rate is from 2015. According to WHO, the suicide rate in 2015 was 10.7 per 100,000 people. It is important to note that this data is not related to Logan Paul's video and does not support the claim that the suicide rate dropped following the video's release.

In conclusion, the claim that the world suicide rate dropped 37% after Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video is false. The claim originated from a fake news website, and the suicide rate does not fluctuate on a day-to-day basis. The video received criticism, but its impact on the suicide rate cannot be determined.
Claim: The world suicide rate plummeted following Logan Paul's ""suicide forest"" video.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

55,10570,Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality,"A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients. The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device. The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators. The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing. It also emphasizes the need for further trials before there is enough evidence to apply for FDA approval. The trials of the new device were funded by the manufacturer, and the lead researcher is the founder of the company. The report includes an independent source, which adds credibility to the information presented. It is important to note that the new device does not offer the heart pacemaker function that some existing implantable defibrillators have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots.

### Input:
Context: A new type of implantable defibrillator that does not have wires attached directly to the heart is closer to becoming a reality, according to a recent report. The device, which is already available in some European countries, uses wires placed under the skin instead of through blood vessels into the heart. This new approach could potentially reduce the risks associated with implantable defibrillators for certain patients.

The report highlights the problems with the electrical lead wires of existing devices, which have harmed patients and required re-operations and recalls. By eliminating the need for wires attached to the heart, the new device aims to address these issues. However, the report cautions that only about a quarter of patients who currently receive implantable defibrillators would be candidates for this new type of device.

The report mentions that the cost of the new device would be similar to existing devices, but the implantation process is simpler, which could potentially lower costs. However, it does not provide an estimated cost for existing implantable defibrillators.

The report acknowledges that the initial experience with the new device has encountered some problems such as lead migration, lead dislodgement, and inappropriate sensing. It also emphasizes the need for further trials before there is enough evidence to apply for FDA approval.

The trials of the new device were funded by the manufacturer, and the lead researcher is the founder of the company. The report includes an independent source, which adds credibility to the information presented.

It is important to note that the new device does not offer the heart pacemaker function that some existing implantable defibrillators have. The report suggests that the new device could be an incremental improvement on existing devices for certain patients, depending on the results of further trials.

In conclusion, the report highlights the progress made towards developing implantable defibrillators that do not require wires attached directly to the heart. It emphasizes the need for further research and trials before the device can be considered for clinical use and FDA approval in the United States.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Johnson emphasized that things will get worse before they get better and urged people to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.

The UK government is increasing the number of tests being carried out, with a target of 10,000 tests per day. They are also working to acquire more ventilators, placing an order for thousands of devices to be made by a consortium of companies including Ford, Airbus, and Rolls-Royce. This effort to repurpose industry is reminiscent of Britain's Second World War effort. Housing Minister Robert Jenrick stated that the entire country is now on an ""emergency footing"" as strategic coordination centers are established. He described this as an unprecedented step in peacetime.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

The claim was based on an op-ed piece written by AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson and a study done by the Cohen Children's Medical Center in Long Island, NY. However, the study's chief researcher, Dr. Andrew Adesman, stated that the media wrongly attributed the drinking-texting conclusions to his team's studies.

This correlation makes it difficult to determine the leading contributing factor in teen driving deaths.

The involvement of cell phones in accidents is underreported, making it challenging to gather accurate data.

NHTSA reported that 12% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes were distracted, with 24% of those distracted drivers using a cell phone. In comparison, 20% of teen drivers involved in fatal crashes had alcohol in their system.

Context: The Guggenheim Museum in New York planned to host an exhibition called ""Art and China after 1989,"" which featured three installations that were criticized for animal cruelty. The installations included a video showing dogs strapped to treadmills and forced to run without touching each other, a video showing pigs with letters stamped on them having sex, and a table covered in a dome containing insects and reptiles. The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: Ken Dierdorf, a Vietnam War veteran, passed away at the age of 68 after a long battle with Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Dierdorf's health had been deteriorating since his diagnosis in 2010, and he eventually required a full-time respirator to aid his breathing. Despite his illness, Dierdorf had expressed a desire to fly in a military helicopter with his fellow veterans, known as the Dirty Half Dozen. The Dierdorfs reached out to the Visiting Nurse Association and Hospice of the Wabash Valley to arrange a Bell UH-1 Iroquois ""Huey"" ride for the group. Although Dierdorf was unable to participate in the flight due to his condition, he was able to reunite with his friends and witness their experience, which fulfilled his last wish. Dierdorf's wife, Kim, stated that he had been talking about the flight nonstop since Saturday and that it meant a lot to him. Gil Edgington, one of the Dirty Half Dozen friends, expressed that Dierdorf's final wish being fulfilled was fitting for someone as kind and full of life as him. He believed that it was all part of God's plan and that Dierdorf's passing meant an end to his suffering.

59,7685,China expands switch from polluting coal heating in 2018: environment minister.,"China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie. Last year, 4.8 million households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity, up from 4 million households in 2017. China's winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal annually, and converting to low-emission heating was seen as a key part of the country's fight against pollution. Additionally, China has implemented ultra-low emissions technology in over 80 percent of its coal-fired power generation capacity. However, Li Ganjie warned that despite the progress made in 2018, China's battle against smog is becoming more challenging. He stated that the easy tasks have already been completed, and the remaining tasks are more difficult. While China reduced the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent in 2018, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, Li Ganjie believes it is still too high. He also mentioned regional disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection measures. China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry is determined to continue its efforts to curb pollution. However, concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 increased over the winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities rising by 13 percent from October to February. In response to these challenges, China announced that it would implement special emissions restrictions for the third consecutive winter.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: China made progress in its efforts to reduce pollution by switching households from coal to cleaner types of fuel for winter heating, according to China's environment minister, Li Ganjie. Last year, 4.8 million households made the switch from coal to natural gas and electricity, up from 4 million households in 2017. China's winter heating program used to burn an estimated 400 million tonnes of coal annually, and converting to low-emission heating was seen as a key part of the country's fight against pollution. Additionally, China has implemented ultra-low emissions technology in over 80 percent of its coal-fired power generation capacity. 

However, Li Ganjie warned that despite the progress made in 2018, China's battle against smog is becoming more challenging. He stated that the easy tasks have already been completed, and the remaining tasks are more difficult. While China reduced the share of coal in its total energy mix to 59 percent in 2018, down from 68.5 percent in 2012, Li Ganjie believes it is still too high. He also mentioned regional disparities in the enforcement of environmental protection measures.

China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990 last year, and the environment ministry is determined to continue its efforts to curb pollution. However, concentrations of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 increased over the winter, with averages in 39 smog-prone northern cities rising by 13 percent from October to February.

In response to these challenges, China announced that it would implement special emissions restrictions for the third consecutive winter. Premier Li Keqiang also stated that the government would continue to strengthen pollution controls in 2019. Despite the difficulties, China remains committed to reducing pollution and improving air quality.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The Guggenheim Museum in New York planned to host an exhibition called ""Art and China after 1989,"" which featured three installations that were criticized for animal cruelty. The installations included a video showing dogs strapped to treadmills and forced to run without touching each other, a video showing pigs with letters stamped on them having sex, and a table covered in a dome containing insects and reptiles. The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk.

There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction?

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: At the World Economic Forum in Davos, CEOs of consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and PepsiCo have faced criticism and pressure over their handling of plastic waste, similar to how coal and oil chiefs were scrutinized over climate change in previous years. Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan compared the situation to the coal industry, stating that these companies are trying to avoid regulation. The CEOs at Davos have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging through various initiatives, including a joint recycling scheme. However, Greenpeace argues that recycling is not enough and calls for plastic packaging bans and a goal of ""peak plastic."" The issue of plastic waste has gained prominence due to alarming statistics, such as 8 million tonnes of plastic being dumped into the oceans each year, causing harm to marine life and entering the food chain. The CEOs of Unilever and PepsiCo have acknowledged the urgency of the issue and have made commitments to reduce plastic packaging. Unilever, for example, promised in 2017 to ensure that all of its plastic packaging is recyclable, reusable, or compostable by 2025. Several companies, including Carrefour, Tesco, PepsiCo, and Unilever, have signed up for a pilot waste-reduction program unveiled at Davos, which involves delivering products in reusable bottles and collecting them for cleaning and re-use. The plastic debate has also caught the attention of the insurance industry, with Swiss Re's CEO stating that if companies face lawsuits for their plastic waste, it could impact their ability to obtain insurance coverage. Greenpeace's call for more bans on plastic packaging was met with resistance from Unilever and PepsiCo, who argue that the issue requires multiple solutions, including recycling, re-use, and new packaging technologies. The European Union recently passed measures to ban throw-away plastic items by 2021, but Greenpeace called for further reduction targets. Greenpeace and other critics argue that industry initiatives alone are not enough to solve the plastic waste problem, as many companies are expanding production of single-use plastic. French Secretary of State for Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Energy, Brune Poirson, criticized the companies for not taking enough initiative and stated that government intervention is necessary.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that the U.S. government is planning to release a new $20 bill with a hologram of Harriet Tubman on it is partially true. The U.S. Treasury Department announced in April 2016 that it would be replacing the portrait of Andrew Jackson on the front of the $20 bill with a portrait of Harriet Tubman, and that the new design would be released by 2020. However, the Treasury Department has not announced any plans to include a hologram of Tubman on the new $20 bill. The claim that the new $20 bill will include a hologram of Tubman is likely a rumor or a misunderstanding of the original announcement.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The Guggenheim Museum in New York planned to host an exhibition called ""Art and China after 1989,"" which featured three installations that were criticized for animal cruelty. The installations included a video showing dogs strapped to treadmills and forced to run without touching each other, a video showing pigs with letters stamped on them having sex, and a table covered in a dome containing insects and reptiles. The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: French prosecutors have opened an investigation into Monsanto, the agrochemical company now owned by Bayer, following a complaint filed by daily newspaper Le Monde. The complaint alleges that Monsanto compiled a file of around 200 names, including journalists and lawmakers, in an attempt to influence their positions on pesticides. The file, which dates back to 2016, was leaked by US public relations and marketing agency FleishmanHillard. Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in a $63 billion deal last year, declined to comment on the investigation, stating that it did not know which documents the allegations referred to. The company emphasized its commitment to openness and fair treatment of all interest groups, as well as compliance with data privacy regulations. FleishmanHillard has stated that it will investigate the allegations made in Le Monde. The company plans to examine the questions raised by certain media outlets regarding the lists of stakeholders, which it claims included publicly available information. 

Bayer is currently facing numerous lawsuits over its weedkiller Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. In August 2018, a US jury found the company liable for not warning users about the alleged cancer risks associated with Roundup. Last month, Bayer suffered another defeat in a similar case, and over 13,000 plaintiffs are now seeking damages. The company has stated that it intends to defend itself in all lawsuits.

Context: The claim that the US government is planning to use the military to round up and detain immigrants is not supported by evidence. The rumor appears to have originated from a Facebook post that included a screenshot of a supposed government document. However, the document is a forgery, and the text of the post has been altered to make it appear as though it was written by a government official. The original post was made by a user who frequently shares conspiracy theories and false information. The claim has been debunked by multiple fact-checking organizations, including Snopes and FactCheck.org. The US government has not announced any plans to use the military for immigration enforcement, and the Department of Defense has stated that it will not be involved in such activities.

65,11409,Study finds computers hinder accuracy in mammography,"A study has found that the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) in mammography may hinder accuracy rather than improve it. The article mentions that the cost of using CAD adds about $20 to the cost of each mammogram, but this charge is covered by Medicare and most insurers. It also states that medical centers have invested between $125,000 and $175,000 in these machines. The benefits of CAD technology were reported in terms of the absolute number of tumors detected. However, the article points out that the harm of unnecessary biopsies was mentioned, but the increased number of biopsies was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute value. It suggests that the use of CAD may increase the number of cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which may not pose a health risk during a woman's lifetime. The benefit of cancer treatment for women with this diagnosis is therefore unclear. The article acknowledges that the evidence presented in the study showed no difference in breast cancer detection rates when using CAD. It also mentions that the source of the study was included in the story, and multiple sources were used, some directly involved in the study and some not. The article does not engage in disease mongering. One option to CAD mentioned in the article is a breast center where every mammogram is read by two radiologists, which was described as more effective at finding cancers than a computer system. The value of experienced radiologists reading conventional mammograms is also emphasized. The article states that about 25% of mammography centers in the US use CAD. It does not mislead on the novelty of this technology, explaining that it is already used in about 25% of mammography centers. It also mentions that the story does not appear to rely on a press release.",true,"This story reports on the first large scale analysis of whether computer aided detection (CAD) improves the interpretation of mammograms. As was reported in the story, the study found that the use of CAD actually reduced the accuracy of the breast cancer screening. The story included technical detail about how CAD is used and made important points about the real value of experienced mammographers. It covered costs – the additional cost of computer detection and of the machines. And it turned to several sources – some involved in the study and some not. The story might have helped women with a few more questions. What should a woman do with this information? Should she go to a facility that uses computer-aided detection? Should she ask that it not be used? Are there other things she should do to make sure that her screening is a high quality as possible?

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) in mammography may hinder accuracy rather than improve it. The article mentions that the cost of using CAD adds about $20 to the cost of each mammogram, but this charge is covered by Medicare and most insurers. It also states that medical centers have invested between $125,000 and $175,000 in these machines.

The benefits of CAD technology were reported in terms of the absolute number of tumors detected. However, the article points out that the harm of unnecessary biopsies was mentioned, but the increased number of biopsies was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute value. It suggests that the use of CAD may increase the number of cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which may not pose a health risk during a woman's lifetime. The benefit of cancer treatment for women with this diagnosis is therefore unclear.

The article acknowledges that the evidence presented in the study showed no difference in breast cancer detection rates when using CAD. It also mentions that the source of the study was included in the story, and multiple sources were used, some directly involved in the study and some not. The article does not engage in disease mongering.

One option to CAD mentioned in the article is a breast center where every mammogram is read by two radiologists, which was described as more effective at finding cancers than a computer system. The value of experienced radiologists reading conventional mammograms is also emphasized.

The article states that about 25% of mammography centers in the US use CAD. It does not mislead on the novelty of this technology, explaining that it is already used in about 25% of mammography centers. It also mentions that the story does not appear to rely on a press release.

66,644,Climate change endangers Scotland's archaeological treasures.,"Scotland's Orkney Islands, known for their rich historical sites, are facing the threat of climate change. With over 3,000 historical sites, some dating back 8,500 years, the islands are home to buildings from the Iron Age, Viking rule, and medieval times. However, approximately 1,000 sites located on the coastline are at risk. One such site is the Iron Age building South Howe Broch on the island of Rousay, which is gradually being eroded by the sea. Julie Gibson, a lecturer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, predicts that the broch will eventually disappear. Another nearby site, Midhowe Broch, is better preserved due to a sea wall built in the 1930s, but it is still vulnerable to climate change. A climate risk assessment conducted by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in July highlighted the ""extreme"" potential impact of climate change on Orkney's Neolithic sites and their high vulnerability. The assessment revealed that average precipitation in Scotland has increased by 27% since the 1960s, leading to wetter buildings that are more prone to decay. Rising sea levels and beach erosion are also contributing to the destruction of historical sites. Orkney's beaches have narrowed by an average of 16 inches per year since 1970, compared to eight inches between 1890 and 1970. Skara Brae, a famous Neolithic settlement on Orkney, is particularly at risk. Occupied from 3100-2500BC, the settlement was originally located approximately one kilometer from the sea. However, it now sits just a few meters from the North Atlantic. Skara Brae features well-preserved stone buildings, including hearths, bed recesses, cupboards, and dressers.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

67,10900,Botox may prevent irregular heartbeat after bypass surgery,"A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery. Atrial fibrillation after surgery can lead to longer hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. The study involved 60 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either botulinum toxin or saline injections. The results showed that there were no additional complications from the Botox injections compared to the saline group.

The novel use of botulinum toxin represented in the story is an interesting and potentially important step toward a possible solution. As noted, the research was conducted in a small sample of 60 patients and although the results are impressive, they should be viewed with an understanding that many other potential therapies have failed on subsequent examination. The news release is written in a clear and measured way, although a clarification on the type of botulinum toxin used and the potential costs would have been helpful for reporters and the public. Atrial fibrillation after coronary bypass surgery is a vexing problem. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation post-procedure do so within a few days of the procedure so an intraoperative or preoperative solution seems reasonable.Atrial fibrillation can cause serious complications for the patient undergoing heart bypass, extend their stay in the hospital, and substantially drive up the costs of the heart treatment.","A recent study has found that injections of botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, may help prevent atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) after coronary artery bypass surgery.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: In rare cases, getting your hair washed at a beauty salon can increase the chances of having a stroke. This condition, known as Beauty Parlor Stroke Syndrome, occurs when the neck is hyperextended and the vertebrae slice an artery, causing a clot to form and later leading to a stroke. Older people have a higher risk of experiencing a stroke during or after a visit to the salon. A study from 1993 found that four out of five patients suffered strokes leading to permanent neurologic damage. Neck motion beyond a certain degree, such as hyperextension and rotation, can be extremely dangerous for older individuals. Anesthesia or prolonged dental work can also make patients vulnerable to this condition. A 2006 study suggested that changing the shampoo routine from a hanging head position to a flexed or neutral position can prevent this risk. While this injury is uncommon, it has been seen in other situations such as surfing, dental visits, and even falling asleep in a movie theater. Signs to watch for after a potential injury include pain on one side of the neck after extension and neurologic symptoms like vertigo. People with genetic disorders or connective tissue diseases may be more prone to this condition. Elizabeth Smith, a woman who suffered a stroke after getting her hair washed at a salon, is now suing the salon for damages. She wants to raise awareness about the condition and debunk the skepticism that people may feel nothing when the injury occurs. The delay from injury to stroke is due to a small bleed that takes time for the body to build a clot big enough to cause damage. Smith hopes that her story will help others understand the risks associated with getting their hair washed at a salon.

The neighbor complained to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and five months later, the agency responded with a letter to Tvedten, ordering him to cease and desist the construction and maintenance of two wood debris dams across the outlet stream of Spring Pond.

Tvedten argued that the beavers had the right to build their dams and that the DEQ should focus on other environmental issues, such as bears defecating in the woods. The DEQ later claimed that they were aware the dams were beaver dams, but the issue was that the beavers had abandoned the dams and Tvedten had been maintaining and building them up himself.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

He challenged the DEQ to try and emulate the beavers' dam project and questioned whether the beavers were entitled to legal representation. Tvedten argued that the beavers had the right to build their dams and that the DEQ should focus on other environmental issues, such as bears defecating in the woods.

The DEQ later claimed that they were aware the dams were beaver dams, but the issue was that the beavers had abandoned the dams and Tvedten had been maintaining and building them up himself. The DEQ stated that in the absence of any threat to public welfare, beaver dams should be left in their natural state.

Tvedten argued that the dams were abandoned because a neighbor had killed the beavers and that no one but the beavers had ever maintained them. The DEQ admitted that they had not performed an inspection before sending the letter to Tvedten.

The article summarizes the situation where the state of Michigan threatened local beavers with a $10,000 per day fine for failing to remove their dams. The issue arose when a neighbor complained about flooding caused by the dams, leading the DEQ to send a letter to Tvedten ordering him to cease and desist the construction and maintenance of the dams. Tvedten responded by explaining that the dams were built by beavers and not by him. The DEQ later admitted that they were aware the dams were beaver dams but claimed that Tvedten had been maintaining and building them up himself.

70,10611,Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise,"A recent article titled ""Treatment for Peanut Allergies Shows Promise"" discusses a new experimental treatment for peanut allergies that has shown positive results in early studies. The article mentions that the treatment has been tested on a small number of patients, with most of them showing improved resistance to peanut allergens. Five patients were able to tolerate peanuts without any reaction, while four had to withdraw from the study due to intolerance to the treatment. The article also mentions that the second test involved splitting the subjects into treatment and placebo groups, with approximate outcomes for each group described. However, the article is criticized for not providing enough information about the methodology and outcomes of the studies. It is noted that the studies have not been published or peer-reviewed, and the study groups were very small, consisting of only 33 and 18 subjects. The article should have made it clear from the beginning that the evidence is of low quality and that more study is needed. The article also fails to provide a sufficient warning about potential harms and the need for close medical supervision. It is mentioned in the last line that parents should not try the approach at home, but this warning should have appeared earlier. Additionally, the article does not mention whether those who did not tolerate the treatment required any intervention to quell allergic reactions. The only source quoted in the article is Dr. Wesley Burks of Duke University Medical Center, one of the researchers involved in the study. However, it is not disclosed that Burks has financial relationships with companies related to allergies. The article should have included an additional source with no connection to the research. The article does mention that there are no approved treatments for food allergies and that the experimental treatment for peanut allergy is in the early stages of human research.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article discusses Vice President Joe Biden's call for a ""moonshot"" to cure cancer and his statement that nearly 50 percent of cancers are preventable. Specifically, Biden mentions cervical cancer in Africa as being fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. However, the article argues that while cervical cancer is highly preventable, it is not fully preventable in Africa due to various challenges.

The article cites a fact-sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which states that in the United States, 93 percent of cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through screening and HPV vaccination. However, the article questions whether the same results can be achieved in Africa, given the differences in healthcare systems.

Beth Meyerson, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Indiana University, states that Sub-Saharan Africa would not be able to achieve 100 percent prevention of cervical cancer. Meghan Dubyak, a Biden spokeswoman, clarifies that Biden was referring to the travesty of cervical cancer being preventable, rather than claiming it is fully preventable.

The article highlights the high incidence of cervical cancer in Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. It mentions a report from the Sub-Saharan African Cervical Cancer Working Group, which identifies a lack of widespread services, delays in receiving results, and a lack of high-quality laboratories and treatment centers as key reasons behind the reach of the disease.

The article also emphasizes the need for vaccination programs in Sub-Saharan Africa, as some strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can lead to cervical cancer. However, the lack of infrastructure for screening and vaccinating young women, as well as the high cost of vaccines, pose significant challenges.

In conclusion, the article disputes Biden's claim that cervical cancer in Africa is fully preventable with basic education, screening, and vaccines. While cervical cancer is highly preventable, the lack of infrastructure and resources in Africa, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, make it difficult to achieve the same level of prevention as in developed countries.

72,4447,New genetic links to same-sex sexual behavior found.,"A genome-wide research study on DNA from nearly half a million U.S. and U.K. adults has identified five genetic variants that were more common in people who reported ever having had a same-sex sexual partner. However, the study found that none of these genetic variants cause same-sex behavior nor can predict whether someone will be gay. The researchers believe that thousands more genetic variants are likely involved and interact with non-inherited factors. The study, published in the journal Science, provides insight into the genetic underpinnings of same-sex sexual behavior but emphasizes that genetics is only a contributing factor and less than half of the story. The study focused on behavior rather than sexual identity or orientation and included participants of European ancestry only. The study also found that some of the genetic variants were present in both men and women, with two variants in men located near genes involved in male-pattern baldness and sense of smell.

Some experts believe that the study advances the understanding of the genetics of human sexual preference, while others argue that the absence of information on sexual orientation in the study makes it unclear what the identified genetic links might signify.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A genome-wide research study on DNA from nearly half a million U.S. and U.K. adults has identified five genetic variants that were more common in people who reported ever having had a same-sex sexual partner. However, the study found that none of these genetic variants cause same-sex behavior nor can predict whether someone will be gay. The researchers believe that thousands more genetic variants are likely involved and interact with non-inherited factors. The study, published in the journal Science, provides insight into the genetic underpinnings of same-sex sexual behavior but emphasizes that genetics is only a contributing factor and less than half of the story. The study focused on behavior rather than sexual identity or orientation and included participants of European ancestry only. The study also found that some of the genetic variants were present in both men and women, with two variants in men located near genes involved in male-pattern baldness and sense of smell. The researchers acknowledged the limitation of the study and noted that it cannot answer whether similar results would be found in other groups. The origins of same-sex behavior are uncertain, with many scientists believing that social, cultural, family, and other biological factors are also involved. The study's findings have been met with varied reactions from experts. Some experts believe that the study advances the understanding of the genetics of human sexual preference, while others argue that the absence of information on sexual orientation in the study makes it unclear what the identified genetic links might signify. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of sexuality and the involvement of multiple genes in same-sex behavior.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

75,1308,Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned of shortages as more than 1.5 million Americans have received the vaccine since the end of last year. GSK has increased deliveries significantly and is vaccinating people against shingles at a faster rate than before, but it is struggling to keep up with the high demand. The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck's older and less effective vaccine, leading to strong demand. Consensus forecasts predict peak annual sales for Shingrix of around £1.5 billion ($2 billion), but Exane BNP analysts believe this estimate may be too low. They suggest sales could rise to £3 billion if Shingrix achieves market penetration rates of around 60%, similar to Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. In its first full quarter on the market, Shingrix achieved sales of £110 million, and GSK expects 2018 sales to exceed £400 million. Shingrix is a key product for GSK CEO Emma Walmsley as she aims to improve the company's commercial performance and demonstrate the profit potential of GSK's vaccines business. GSK has already achieved its mid-term goal of reaching vaccine margins of 30%, and Exane BNP believes it could reach 35% by 2020 with the introduction of Shingrix and other premium vaccines. Shingrix is administered in two doses, while Merck's Zostavax is a single shot. Ensuring patients adhere to the two-shot regimen will be crucial in maximizing the vaccine's sales potential. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which is also responsible for chickenpox.

Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is facing a problem as demand for its shingles vaccine, Shingrix, is outstripping supply. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned of shortages as more than 1.5 million Americans have received the vaccine since the end of last year. GSK has increased deliveries significantly and is vaccinating people against shingles at a faster rate than before, but it is struggling to keep up with the high demand. The CDC has recommended Shingrix over Merck's older and less effective vaccine, leading to strong demand. Consensus forecasts predict peak annual sales for Shingrix of around £1.5 billion ($2 billion), but Exane BNP analysts believe this estimate may be too low. They suggest sales could rise to £3 billion if Shingrix achieves market penetration rates of around 60%, similar to Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar. In its first full quarter on the market, Shingrix achieved sales of £110 million, and GSK expects 2018 sales to exceed £400 million. Shingrix is a key product for GSK CEO Emma Walmsley as she aims to improve the company's commercial performance and demonstrate the profit potential of GSK's vaccines business. GSK has already achieved its mid-term goal of reaching vaccine margins of 30%, and Exane BNP believes it could reach 35% by 2020 with the introduction of Shingrix and other premium vaccines. Shingrix is administered in two doses, while Merck's Zostavax is a single shot. Ensuring patients adhere to the two-shot regimen will be crucial in maximizing the vaccine's sales potential. Shingles is caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus, which is also responsible for chickenpox. The virus lies dormant in the nervous system of nearly all adults over 50, putting them at risk of shingles as they age.
Claim: Clamor for GSK shingles shot points to bigger profits.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The Senate has approved a Coast Guard budget authorization bill that includes provisions for regulating the disposal of ballast water, which is used to stabilize vessels in rough seas but can introduce unwanted organisms to US waters. The bill, which has been sent to the House for consideration, would see the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set national rules for ballast and other water discharges, with the Coast Guard responsible for enforcement. The bill also prohibits states from imposing stricter treatment rules than those set by the EPA, except in the Great Lakes region, where regional requirements could be imposed if enough of the eight states that border the lakes want them. The bill authorizes $10.6bn for the Coast Guard in fiscal year 2019, a 16% increase from 2017, which will be used to modernize the fleet of cutters and aircraft. The bill also contains provisions to help the agency crack down on drug smuggling and enforce borders, as well as boost efforts to respond to oil spills and build a National Coast Guard Museum. The bill has been praised by both the shipping industry and environmentalists, although debate is expected to continue over the strength of the regulations. The current federal policy limits the number of live organisms in ballast water before it is discharged, but environmentalists argue that the international standards are too weak. The EPA has been ordered by a federal court to strengthen the standards, but shippers claim that the technology available cannot meet the cleanliness targets demanded by environmentalists.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Response:

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

79,25422,A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration.,"The article discusses a claim made by Hillary Clinton during a campaign speech in Shenandoah, Iowa. Clinton argued that the federal government is not adequately protecting the public due to insufficient inspections of toys and food. She used the example of a ham and cheese sandwich to illustrate her point, stating that a sandwich on one slice of bread falls under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which conducts daily inspections of manufacturers. However, a sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which only inspects manufacturers about once every five years. To verify Clinton's claim, the article refers to government reports on food safety, interviews with the head of the USDA's food inspection service, and the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. It confirms that Clinton's example is correct, highlighting the significant disparity in inspections conducted by the two agencies. Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged the absurdity of the sandwich rule and admitted that it defies logic. However, he stated that the rule does not impact the safety of the nation's food supply. The article explains that the distinction between USDA and FDA jurisdiction over sandwiches can be traced back to Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, published in 1906. The book exposed horrific conditions in meat plants and led to the enactment of a law requiring meat inspections. Since then, the USDA has focused on meat and poultry inspections, while other foods fall under the FDA's purview. The FDA, however, does not have a mandate for regular inspections, and a report by the Government Accountability Office confirms that the agency inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years on average. Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, criticizes the current food safety system, stating that it is based on antiquated laws and divided agencies. She argues that the lack of regular inspections and insufficient funding for the FDA puts the public at risk. These concerns are echoed in a report from an FDA advisory panel, which states that the agency is overburdened and underfunded, making it unable to effectively conduct routine surveillance of the nation's food supply.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

However, he stated that the rule does not impact the safety of the nation's food supply.

The article explains that the distinction between USDA and FDA jurisdiction over sandwiches can be traced back to Upton Sinclair's novel, The Jungle, published in 1906. The book exposed horrific conditions in meat plants and led to the enactment of a law requiring meat inspections. Since then, the USDA has focused on meat and poultry inspections, while other foods fall under the FDA's purview. The FDA, however, does not have a mandate for regular inspections, and a report by the Government Accountability Office confirms that the agency inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years on average.

Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, criticizes the current food safety system, stating that it is based on antiquated laws and divided agencies. She argues that the lack of regular inspections and insufficient funding for the FDA puts the public at risk. These concerns are echoed in a report from an FDA advisory panel, which states that the agency is overburdened and underfunded, making it unable to effectively conduct routine surveillance of the nation's food supply.

In conclusion, the article confirms that Hillary Clinton's claim about the regulation of sandwiches and the disparity in inspections by the USDA and FDA is accurate. It highlights the historical background of the distinction between the two agencies and raises concerns about the current food safety system's ability to protect the public.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The Guggenheim Museum in New York planned to host an exhibition called ""Art and China after 1989,"" which featured three installations that were criticized for animal cruelty. The installations included a video showing dogs strapped to treadmills and forced to run without touching each other, a video showing pigs with letters stamped on them having sex, and a table covered in a dome containing insects and reptiles. The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk.

There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: In December 2015, Daniel Frederick Rushing was arrested in Orlando, Florida after a traffic stop. The police found a ""rock-like substance"" on the floorboard of his car, which they suspected to be methamphetamine. Rushing claimed that the substance was actually glaze from a Krispy Kreme donut that he had been eating. Despite his explanation, Rushing was arrested and charged with possession of amphetamine with a weapon. He was jailed for ten hours before lab reports came back showing no trace of illegal substances.

This incident is not an isolated case. Investigative journalists found that up to half of the positive results from the $2 drug kits used by Florida police for field testing are later invalidated. In one instance, Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies produced 15 false positives for methamphetamine in just seven months. The tests have been known to mistake harmless substances like sage, motor oil, jolly ranchers, and breath mints for illegal drugs. In another case, a Minnesota man spent months in jail after his vitamin powder tested positive for amphetamines.

The article also mentions that there is no central agency regulating the use of drug tests in police departments, and there are no comprehensive records about their use. In Austin, Texas, law enforcement stopped relying on field tests for drug-related indictments in 2013 due to the high number of false positives. Instead, they returned to slower lab test results for suspected drug offenses.

This incident highlights the issue of false positives in drug field tests. Rushing plans to sue the city for his wrongful arrest, although the Orlando police claim that the arrest was lawful. The article emphasizes the need for more reliable drug testing methods and better regulation of the use of drug tests in law enforcement.

82,1972,Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.,"A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s. The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine. According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption. The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.",true,"Americans may be cutting back on super-sized meals, but waistlines continue to expand from more frequent eating, according to a study released on Wednesday.","A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A study conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that the number of daily meals and snacks consumed by U.S. adults has increased over the past 30 years. In 1977, adults consumed an average of 3.8 meals and snacks per day, but by 2006, this number had risen to 4.8. In the top 10 percent of those surveyed, the number of daily meals and snacks increased from five to seven. 

Although the size of meal portions has stabilized in recent years, the study found that the number of total calories consumed is rising. Americans were consuming 570 more calories per day in 2006 compared to the late 1970s. One of the main contributors to this calorie gain is the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which has risen by 220 calories daily since the 1960s.

The study is the first to examine the combined contribution of changes in portion sizes, the caloric level of foods, and eating frequency on people's total calorie consumption. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal PLoS Medicine.

According to Kiyah Duffey, one of the study's authors, large portion sizes drove the rise in calories during the early part of the study period. However, as people became more aware of portion sizes, there was a decline in the portion sizes they consumed. Duffey suggests that in recent decades, the increase in the number of eating occasions is driving the change in calorie consumption.

The availability of food and a decline in regular mealtimes may be contributing to this pattern. Duffey explains that people are no longer sitting down to three meals a day but are eating throughout the day. Some sources of dieting and health advice claim that frequent eating in small doses can boost metabolism and control hunger, suggesting it is a healthier way of eating than having three big meals. However, Duffey emphasizes that what and how much you eat over the course of the day is more important than how often you eat. She advises choosing healthier options like apples instead of salty snacks or pizza.
Claim: Study finds Americans are eating more - and more often.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

84,4252,Judge tosses $417M award against Johnson & Johnson.,"A Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, Maren Nelson, has granted Johnson & Johnson's request for a new trial, overturning a $417 million award that was given to a woman who claimed that the company's talcum powder caused her ovarian cancer. The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision.

Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.
Claim: West Nile virus confirmed in miniature horse in Pine City.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

The New York Times previewed these exhibits and described them in detail. The descriptions were also supported by photographs. The Guggenheim Museum decided not to include these installations in the exhibition due to concerns for the safety of staff, visitors, and participating artists.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, Maren Nelson, has granted Johnson & Johnson's request for a new trial, overturning a $417 million award that was given to a woman who claimed that the company's talcum powder caused her ovarian cancer. The judge stated that there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial, and also ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice. The judge further deemed the awarded damages to be excessive. Although the woman, Eva Echeverria, has since passed away, her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr., plans to appeal the decision. He stated that they will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by the product. Echeverria had alleged that Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential cancer risks associated with their talcum powder. She had used the company's baby powder daily from the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007. Her attorney argued that documents showed that the company had known about the risks for decades. Johnson & Johnson expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating that ovarian cancer is not caused by the cosmetic-grade talc used in their baby powder. They emphasized that they will continue to defend the safety of their product as they prepare for additional trials in the United States. The company has faced numerous similar allegations, resulting in hundreds of lawsuits and jury awards totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. However, a Missouri appellate court recently overturned a $72 million award to the family of a woman who had died, ruling that the state was not the proper jurisdiction for the case. The court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that limited where injury lawsuits could be filed, stating that state courts cannot hear claims against companies not based in the state where the alleged injuries occurred.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The claim that Justin Bieber and Katy Perry made public statements asserting that the music industry is run by pedophiles is not supported by credible sources. The articles that reported on these statements were published on unreliable websites known for spreading conspiracy theories. The article from YourNewsWire, written by Dmitry Baxter, suggested that Bieber canceled the last leg of his 2017 world tour because he realized that pedophilia is rampant in the entertainment business. However, there is no evidence to support these claims, and no mainstream news outlets have quoted or mentioned such statements by Bieber or Perry. 

While it is true that Bieber canceled part of his 2017 tour and Perry expressed her struggles with her public persona, these facts do not lend credibility to the claims about pedophilia in the music industry. The statements attributed to Bieber and Perry are lurid fabrications designed to gain social media attention or spread disinformation about ""Hollywood elites."" 

The dissemination of these false stories not only dilutes the impact of actual claims of industry pedophilia made by credible sources like Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood but also poses a risk of inciting violence. The Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which falsely claimed that a pizza restaurant in Washington DC was running a pedophile ring, led to a shooting incident. It is crucial to avoid false reporting on such sensitive topics as child abuse.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: The article discusses the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti, who have lost limbs as a result of the devastating earthquake that struck the country in 2010. The players, who train on a dusty pitch near Cite Soleil, Haiti's largest slum, faced off in a match on the anniversary of the earthquake as a commemoration of the disaster. Many people in Haiti lost limbs in the earthquake, and the players have received treatment, athletic training, and prosthetic limbs through a program funded by Miami's Project Medishare and the Knights of Columbus. Over 100 young quake victims have been fitted with limbs so far, with hundreds more set to begin treatment in the coming weeks and months.

Despite the uplifting example of the amputee players, there is a sense of pessimism and despair in Haiti. The country was already impoverished before the earthquake, with 70% of the population living on less than $2 a day. The rebuilding efforts have been slow, and major streets in the capital city of Port-au-Prince are still covered in debris. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who heads a reconstruction commission, has faced criticism for the lack of tangible results. The anniversary of the earthquake promises little in the way of celebration, with many people expressing disappointment in the lack of progress.

The article also mentions the reopening of Port-au-Prince's restored Iron Market as part of the commemoration events. The market, a cultural and architectural landmark, was badly damaged in the earthquake and has been restored with funding from Irish-owned telecoms company Digicel. However, for many Haitians living in crowded camps, such projects hold little interest. The country has also faced other challenges, including a cholera epidemic and a controversial presidential election.

The article ends by mentioning the nostalgia some Haitians have for the rule of Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, who continued the rule of his father Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier. Despite the ongoing experiment with democracy in Haiti, some people believe that things were better under the Duvalier regime.

Overall, the article highlights the resilience of amputee soccer players in Haiti and the challenges the country continues to face in its recovery from the earthquake.

It highlights recent cases where players have made themselves unavailable for selection due to mental health concerns. Veteran allrounder Glenn Maxwell and ex-test batsman Nic Maddinson both withdrew from the series against Pakistan, while 21-year-old Will Pucovski informed selectors that he didn't want to be considered for national duties. Pucovski had been playing in an Australia A tour game against Pakistan when he made the decision.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.
Claim: U.S. CDC recommends against using vapes with marijuana ingredient.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.
Claim: A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory, North Carolina, Walmart.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The U.S. State Department has issued an updated travel advisory for U.S. travelers, urging them to ""exercise increased caution"" due to reports of a probable Ebola-related death in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. However, Tanzania denies these reports and claims that no cases of Ebola have been confirmed. The government is facing mounting pressure to provide clarification on the situation. The foreign affairs ministry has not yet commented on the U.S. advisory.

Authorities in east and central Africa have been on high alert for possible spillovers of Ebola from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where an outbreak has already claimed over 2,100 lives. Tanzania shares a border with the DRC, separated by a lake.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently criticized Tanzania for refusing to provide details of suspected Ebola cases, which goes against international health regulations. The WHO expressed concern over the lack of transparency but stated that it has no evidence of Ebola presence in Tanzania. The organization ruled out punitive action and reiterated its advice against travel or trade restrictions.

In response to Tanzania's lack of transparency, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) traveled to Tanzania at the direction of U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar. Azar had previously criticized Tanzania for not sharing information.

Tanzania summoned the WHO's local representative over their assertion of suspected Ebola cases in the country. The government had previously investigated two cases of unknown illnesses, but they tested negative for Ebola.

The situation in Tanzania highlights the importance of transparency in combating the deadly and fast-spreading hemorrhagic fever. With the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the neighboring DRC, authorities are on high alert and urging countries to share information to prevent the spread of the disease.
Claim: U.S. travel warning adds to pressure on Tanzania over suspected Ebola cases.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: The claim states that Texas ranks #1 in worker deaths, #1 in carbon emissions, #50 in high school graduates, and #50 in funding for mental health patients. The article examines each of these claims individually. 

Regarding worker deaths, the article cites various sources that indicate Texas had the highest number of worker fatalities in 2010. However, when adjusting for population, Texas ranked 18th in worker deaths per 100,000 workers. Among states with more than 1 million employed, Texas ranked 10th. 

In terms of carbon emissions, Texas did have the highest amount of CO2 emissions in 2010. However, when adjusting for population, Texas would have tied for 13th place. The article also notes that Texas has a large number of industrial facilities, such as oil refineries and chemical plants, which contribute to its high emissions.

Regarding high school graduates, the article states that Texas ranked last in percentage of high school graduates in 2009, with 79.9% of Texans having graduated from high school. However, more recent data from 2011 shows that Texas tied with Mississippi and California for last place, with 81.1% of adults having high school degrees.

In terms of funding for mental health patients, the article cites a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation that shows Texas ranked last in per-resident spending on mental health care in 2009, 2008, and 2007. However, in fiscal 2010, Texas ranked 49th in per-person spending, with Idaho being the only state with lower spending.

Overall, the article concludes that while two of the claims (high school graduates and mental health funding) are fairly solid, the claim takes things out of context by cherry-picking figures to make Texas look worse.
Claim: Texas ranks: 1 in worker deaths, 1 carbon emissions, 50 in high school graduates, 50 in funding for mental health patients.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

91,27876,The sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation.,"The article confirms the claim that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. Giant hogweed is an invasive herb in the carrot family that was originally brought to North America from Asia. It has become established in various regions of the United States, including New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northwest. The plant grows along streams and rivers, as well as in fields, forests, yards, and roadsides. It can reach a height of 14 feet or more, with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width. The sap of the giant hogweed contains toxic chemicals called furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis. This condition leads to reddening of the skin, followed by severe blistering and burns. The injuries can last for several months, and even after they have healed, the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. If the sap enters the eyes, it can cause temporary or even permanent blindness. If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, it is recommended to take the following steps: if a reaction occurs, applying topical steroids early on may lessen the severity of the reaction and provide relief. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so it is advised to apply sunblock and keep the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible. The article also mentions that giant hogweed is not the only dangerous plant one might encounter. Other plants that can cause harm include oleander, a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways, and sago palm, a decorative shrub found in gardens and homes.

The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: The article confirms the claim that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. Giant hogweed is an invasive herb in the carrot family that was originally brought to North America from Asia. It has become established in various regions of the United States, including New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Northwest. The plant grows along streams and rivers, as well as in fields, forests, yards, and roadsides. It can reach a height of 14 feet or more, with compound leaves up to 5 feet in width.

The sap of the giant hogweed contains toxic chemicals called furanocoumarins. When these chemicals come into contact with the skin and are exposed to sunlight, they cause a condition called phytophotodermatitis. This condition leads to reddening of the skin, followed by severe blistering and burns. The injuries can last for several months, and even after they have healed, the affected areas of skin can remain sensitive to light for years. Furanocoumarins are also carcinogenic and teratogenic, meaning they can cause cancer and birth defects. If the sap enters the eyes, it can cause temporary or even permanent blindness.

If someone comes into physical contact with giant hogweed, it is recommended to take the following steps: if a reaction occurs, applying topical steroids early on may lessen the severity of the reaction and provide relief. The affected area of skin may remain sensitive to sunlight for a few years, so it is advised to apply sunblock and keep the affected area shielded from the sun whenever possible.

The article also mentions that giant hogweed is not the only dangerous plant one might encounter. Other plants that can cause harm include oleander, a flowering shrub often used in gardens and along freeways, and sago palm, a decorative shrub found in gardens and homes.

In conclusion, the article confirms that the sap of the giant hogweed plant can cause severe skin and eye irritation. It provides information about the plant's invasive nature, its growth habits, and the toxic chemicals present in its sap. It also offers recommendations for treating and preventing reactions to the sap.

92,8845,Repeat blood clots more common with stents: study.,"A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot. This risk is particularly high for patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago. Stents are wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the coronary arteries to keep them from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. However, clots can form inside the stent, known as stent thrombosis, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack or death. The researchers found that the use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis. Patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment were 4.2 times more likely to experience another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who had previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times more likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times more likely to suffer a repeat episode. The study analyzed 437 patients with various types of stents who had experienced stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. Of these patients, 16.9 percent had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis, with 61 patients experiencing two episodes, 12 patients experiencing three episodes, and one patient experiencing four episodes. In conclusion, the study highlights the increased risk of repeat blood clots in patients who have had a coronary stent. The use of an additional stent during emergency treatment, a history of heart attack, and late stent thrombosis were identified as factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing another episode of stent thrombosis. These findings emphasize the importance of closely monitoring patients with stents to prevent further complications.",true,"Treating a stent-related blood clot with an additional stent in an emergency procedure sharply raises the risk that a patient will get a second clot and should be avoided, Dutch researchers said on Saturday.","A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: A study conducted by the Dutch Stent Thrombosis Study has found that one in six patients who suffer a clot inside a coronary stent are at risk of developing another clot. This risk is particularly high for patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment for the first clot. The study, led by Dr. Jochem Wouter van Werkum of St. Antonius Hospital in the Netherlands, was presented at a joint meeting of the American College of Cardiology and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions in Chicago.

Stents are wire mesh tubes that are inserted into the coronary arteries to keep them from reclogging after they have been cleared of blockages in an angioplasty procedure. However, clots can form inside the stent, known as stent thrombosis, which can block blood flow to the heart and lead to a heart attack or death.

The researchers found that the use of an additional stent during emergency treatment of a stent-related blood clot is a strong predictor of repeat stent thrombosis. Patients who had a second stent implanted during emergency treatment were 4.2 times more likely to experience another episode of stent thrombosis. Patients who had previously had a heart attack were 2.6 times more likely, and those who developed a clot long after stent implantation, known as late stent thrombosis, were 2.1 times more likely to suffer a repeat episode.

The study analyzed 437 patients with various types of stents who had experienced stent thrombosis between January 2004 and February 2007. Of these patients, 16.9 percent had multiple episodes of stent thrombosis, with 61 patients experiencing two episodes, 12 patients experiencing three episodes, and one patient experiencing four episodes.

In conclusion, the study highlights the increased risk of repeat blood clots in patients who have had a coronary stent. The use of an additional stent during emergency treatment, a history of heart attack, and late stent thrombosis were identified as factors that increase the likelihood of experiencing another episode of stent thrombosis. These findings emphasize the importance of closely monitoring patients with stents to prevent further complications.

93,1688,Amazonian tribe study shows how human bodily bacteria is changing.,"A study published in the journal Science Advances has found that the gut, mouth, and skin microbes of the Yanomami villagers, an isolated tribe in southern Venezuela's Amazonian jungles, possess the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in humans. The Yanomami villagers, who were secluded from the outside world until 2009, have bacteria that include some never before detected in humans. Surprisingly, the researchers also found antibiotic-resistant genes in the Yanomami's microbes, even though they have never been exposed to commercial antibiotics. The human body hosts trillions of microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, which are essential for human health. However, modern practices such as processed foods and antibiotics have led to a decline in microbiota diversity. This decline may be linked to the increase in immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes, and obesity. The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 Yanomami villagers and compared them to a group from the United States, another indigenous group from the Venezuelan Amazonian region called the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. The Yanomami villagers were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties compared to the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the other groups offer beneficial effects, such as protecting against kidney stones. The Yanomami villagers are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in a remote mountainous region. The researchers believe that studying their microbiota provides a unique opportunity to understand the impact of modern practices on human bodily bacteria.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

Context: A study published in the journal Science Advances has found that the gut, mouth, and skin microbes of the Yanomami villagers, an isolated tribe in southern Venezuela's Amazonian jungles, possess the most diverse collection of bacteria ever found in humans. The Yanomami villagers, who were secluded from the outside world until 2009, have bacteria that include some never before detected in humans. Surprisingly, the researchers also found antibiotic-resistant genes in the Yanomami's microbes, even though they have never been exposed to commercial antibiotics.

The human body hosts trillions of microbes, collectively known as the microbiota, which are essential for human health. However, modern practices such as processed foods and antibiotics have led to a decline in microbiota diversity. This decline may be linked to the increase in immunological and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes, and obesity.

The researchers analyzed microbial samples from 34 Yanomami villagers and compared them to a group from the United States, another indigenous group from the Venezuelan Amazonian region called the Guahibo, and residents of rural Malawi in southern Africa. The Yanomami villagers were found to have twice the number of microbe varieties compared to the U.S. subjects and 30 to 40 percent more diversity than the Malawians and Guahibo. Some of the bacteria found in the Yanomami but not in the other groups offer beneficial effects, such as protecting against kidney stones.

The Yanomami villagers are semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers living in a remote mountainous region. The researchers believe that studying their microbiota provides a unique opportunity to understand the impact of modern practices on human bodily bacteria. The findings of this study suggest that the pre-modern human microbiota had a greater diversity of bacteria and bacterial functions compared to populations affected by modern practices.

Overall, this study highlights how modern life may be altering humankind's bodily bacteria and the potential consequences of a decline in microbiota diversity.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

Context: Southern Illinois University (SIU) has announced the creation of programs at its Carbondale campus to study medical marijuana and industrial hemp. The programs aim to provide students and farmers with the opportunity to earn a certificate in these subjects. The university has been planning for these programs for several years, taking into account requests and input from stakeholders and students who are interested in preparing for work in these areas.

SIU's interdisciplinary program in cannabis science will combine agriculture and plant biology with courses in chemistry, business, and engineering. The program aims to support the emerging industry of hemp and medicinal cannabis, which have shown benefits in various areas such as health, quality of life, and the production of natural fibers.

The university has already obtained approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration to grow hemp. In the spring, SIU plans to begin planting hemp on a 5-acre parcel of land, which will be divided into individual test plots to study specific research questions related to optimal growing conditions and environmental impact.

Illinois has allowed the sale of medical marijuana since 2015, but only to patients with a limited number of documented conditions. However, in August, Governor Bruce Rauner signed legislation expanding access to medical cannabis and permitting its use as a painkiller. Rauner also lifted the state ban on planting hemp.

SIU's decision to offer programs in marijuana and hemp research aligns with the growing trend of colleges and universities across the country providing courses related to cannabis. The university aims to meet the demand for scientific knowledge in this field and position itself to support the emerging industry.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

97,27017,"If Cory Gardner gets his way, you'd better stock up on condoms.","The article discusses a television ad in Colorado's Senate race between Mark Udall and Cory Gardner that focuses on the topics of abortion and birth control. The ad claims that if Cory Gardner gets his way, people should stock up on condoms because he wants to ban birth control. The ad is sponsored by NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado and is aimed at reaching young voters. The Gardner campaign denies the claim made in the ad and states that Gardner does not want to ban condoms. They clarify that Gardner believes in increased access to contraceptives and has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter. The ad's claim is based on Gardner's support of ""personhood"" measures that define life beginning at fertilization. Gardner co-sponsored a bill known as the Life At Conception Act, which declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, including at the moment of fertilization. Opponents of personhood legislation argue that it could make several FDA-approved contraceptives illegal. However, the article points out that even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, but there is still legal ambiguity. No state has passed a personhood measure, so the impact on specific types of contraceptives is unknown. The article also mentions that Gardner has changed his position on personhood during the 2014 campaign, stating that he no longer supports it because it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. He has also expressed support for allowing the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Gardner's campaign notes that he cosponsored an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specifically stated it would not prohibit the sale, use, prescription, or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug, or chemical. This bill is presented as evidence that Gardner is not anti-contraceptive.

The most obvious interpretation of this statement is that Gardner wants to ban condoms -- something that’s based on an incorrect interpretation of the measures Gardner has supported in the past (and which he has since distanced himself from). Gardner says he doesn’t support banning condoms, and in any case, condoms would not be at issue under the personhood measure he once supported.","The article discusses a television ad in Colorado's Senate race between Mark Udall and Cory Gardner that focuses on the topics of abortion and birth control. The ad claims that if Cory Gardner gets his way, people should stock up on condoms because he wants to ban birth control. The ad is sponsored by NARAL Pro-Choice America and NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado and is aimed at reaching young voters.

The Gardner campaign denies the claim made in the ad and states that Gardner does not want to ban condoms. They clarify that Gardner believes in increased access to contraceptives and has proposed making common forms of oral contraception available over the counter.

The ad's claim is based on Gardner's support of ""personhood"" measures that define life beginning at fertilization. Gardner co-sponsored a bill known as the Life At Conception Act, which declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, including at the moment of fertilization. Opponents of personhood legislation argue that it could make several FDA-approved contraceptives illegal.

However, the article points out that even Gardner acknowledges that some contraceptives could be at risk if personhood passed, but there is still legal ambiguity. No state has passed a personhood measure, so the impact on specific types of contraceptives is unknown.

The article also mentions that Gardner has changed his position on personhood during the 2014 campaign, stating that he no longer supports it because it could potentially impact access to certain forms of birth control. He has also expressed support for allowing the birth control pill to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription.

Gardner's campaign notes that he cosponsored an anti-abortion measure in Colorado that specifically stated it would not prohibit the sale, use, prescription, or administration of a contraceptive measure, device, drug, or chemical. This bill is presented as evidence that Gardner is not anti-contraceptive.

The article concludes that the claim made in the ad, that if Cory Gardner gets his way, people should stock up on condoms, is based on an incorrect interpretation of Gardner's past support for personhood measures. Gardner denies wanting to ban condoms, and condoms would not be affected by the personhood measure he once supported.","### Instruction:

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

Context: The claim that Fireball whisky is being recalled due to concerns over a dangerous ingredient is partially true. In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.
Claim: Calcium tied to lower cancer risk in older people

### Response:
{""veracity"":""true"",""explanation"":""This report on a study about the links between calcium intake and cancer risk does several important things well: It puts these findings in the context of other research It translates the calcium amounts into dietary choices It describes the methodology and conclusions clearly, and includes useful caveats It makes the useful distinction between the benefits of calcium from diet and supplements It packs in the viewpoints of four sources into a fairly short story The story’s biggest shortcoming is a failure to put the relative risk reductions in the context of absolute risk. It’s hard to tell how meaningful a 20 percent risk reduction of head and neck cancer is. One suspects the 7-year risk of those cancers in this population is very small, but we don’t know. There’s also an issue that isn’t captured by the criteria in this review but is worth mentioning nonetheless. It appears that most dietary calcium came from dairy products. If that’s true, do the researchers know whether something in the dairy products other than the calcium that is responsible for the risk reduction? The fact that calcium supplementation didn’t have the same protective effects as calcium-rich foods raises the question. The reporter should have too.""}

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

In October 2014, there were rumors on social media that Fireball whisky was being recalled, causing upset among consumers. However, no news reports confirmed this recall. It was later revealed that while Fireball whisky was not being broadly recalled, it was the subject of scrutiny and a partial recall in Finland and Sweden due to the inclusion of propylene glycol. Finland's liquor retail agency, Alko, recalled Fireball and offered refunds, stating that propylene glycol is not necessarily detrimental to health but is used in a wide range of products. The Swedish state alcohol retailer, Systembolaget, also withdrew Fireball from distribution after concerns over excessive levels of propylene glycol. The regulatory policies regarding propylene glycol in Finland and Sweden are stricter than in the US. The European Union permits smaller amounts of propylene glycol in products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US considers propylene glycol to be safe when used in foods and beverages at levels not exceeding current good manufacturing practice. The rumors that Fireball was recalled in Europe because it contains antifreeze are inaccurate. Propylene glycol, which is found in Fireball, is less toxic and more environmentally safe than the antifreeze that contains ethylene glycol. The amount of propylene glycol used in foods and liquors is limited, and it would be difficult to ingest a dangerous amount through food or drink. The European recalls were not prompted by a change in Fireball's composition but rather due to differing regulatory protocols in different countries. Fireball issued a statement explaining that a logistical mix-up caused bottles intended for the North American market to be shipped to Finland. The brand assured consumers that all formulations are safe to drink and that there is no recall in North America. Fireball fans can continue to enjoy the product as they always have.

### Input:
Context: A study has found that higher calcium intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer in older people. The study looked at 10 different types of cancer and found that men with high calcium intake were 16% less likely to develop colon cancer over a 7-year period compared to those with the lowest calcium intake. However, the article fails to provide information on the absolute risk of colon cancer for these men, which is important in understanding the significance of the risk reduction.

The article also mentions that calcium intake above 1,200 milligrams per day did not show additional benefits, which is important to prevent people from excessively increasing their calcium intake. However, it does not mention the risks of excessive calcium intake, such as kidney problems and malabsorption of other minerals.

The strengths and weaknesses of the study are described, and it is noted that the study was large but not as rigorous as some smaller trials. The results are not conclusive, and the study population is likely healthier than the general population, which is important to consider when interpreting the findings.

The article does a good job of sourcing, including the thoughts of the lead researcher and three independent experts. However, it is worth noting that none of the experts are quoted directly, their viewpoints are paraphrased.

The article properly distinguishes between calcium from diet and supplements, and mentions that the study does not make claims for the novelty of a calcium-rich diet or the general findings. The availability of calcium-rich foods and supplements is not in question.

Overall, the article provides information on the benefits of higher calcium intake in reducing cancer risk in older people, but fails to provide context on the absolute risk and risks of excessive calcium intake. It also does a good job of sourcing and describing the strengths and weaknesses of the study.

### Input:
Context: The claim that a Minnesota man was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property is not entirely accurate. The man, Jay Nygard, had been in a years-long dispute with local authorities over his installation of a wind turbine on his property. The city of Orono had ordered Nygard to stop work on the wind turbine, as it violated zoning regulations. Nygard continued to press ahead with the installation, pouring a concrete pad for the turbine after his building permit application was rejected. The city threatened him with criminal prosecution if he did not remove the turbine.

The dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono resulted in multiple lawsuits and a moratorium on small wind conversion systems in the city. Nygard was found to be in contempt of court in October 2015 for failing to comply with an order to remove the turbine's concrete footing. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but the concrete was removed shortly after his sentencing, and he was released after a few days.

The article highlights that stories like Nygard's are often misconstrued or misrepresented as examples of an overreaching government restricting autonomous lifestyles. Similar stories, such as a man being jailed for collecting rainwater or a judge ruling homegrown vegetables unlawful, have been distorted to fit this narrative. In reality, these disputes often involve specific cases and do not represent a widespread crackdown on self-sustainability.

In conclusion, while Jay Nygard did face legal consequences for his wind turbine installation, the claim that he was jailed simply for possessing a windmill on his property oversimplifies the complex legal dispute between Nygard and the city of Orono.

Context: The claim that a woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart in Hickory, North Carolina, is not supported by evidence. The claim was made by a Facebook user and is similar to other rumors that circulated on social media that summer. These rumors included stories of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews and drug-dispensing assailants in a department store bathroom. The claim about the Walmart incident resembled long-circulating urban legends, such as carjackers using desirable gifts to lure victims and people offering drugged perfume samples in parking lots. The woman's account did not provide any evidence of human trafficking, and her claim that women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam is unsupported by news reports. A search for incidents in Hickory yielded unrelated results, including an article about drug trafficking in the Walmart parking lot. Another article about human trafficking in North Carolina may have inspired fears of sex ring operators among residents. However, it is important to note that human trafficking typically occurs under different circumstances, such as predators grooming victims through the internet or offering help or romantic interest. Inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking can do more harm than good, as individuals potentially at risk would benefit from accurate information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports in New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. These guidelines require anyone passing through the airports who had contact with Ebola patients, even if they are not showing symptoms, to be quarantined. The article mentions that these guidelines have been subject to criticism, particularly from administration officials, who argue that they are unnecessary. The article also mentions that JFK, Newark, and O'Hare airports already have screening processes in place, along with three other American airports. Experts say that people who are not showing symptoms of Ebola are not contagious.

The article then discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It states that Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia, Liberia, where he had been screened for Ebola. However, he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving in the United States. The article notes that it is unclear whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States, as American airports were not yet screening travelers for possible signs of Ebola at that time.

The article also mentions that airport screenings in West African airports, like the one Duncan went through, have been taking place since at least August. These screenings involve taking travelers' temperatures, answering health questionnaires, and visually assessing them for signs of illness. The article states that screenings are also taking place at airports in England, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Egypt, Canada, and now the United States.

The article concludes by stating that the CDC and Department of Homeland Security instituted new airport screening guidelines in early October for travelers from Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone arriving at five major American airports. These guidelines require travelers to go through an Ebola screening process, including temperature checks and questions about possible exposure. The article notes that even with these screening measures in place, it is possible that Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms.

Overall, the article provides information about the recent increase in Ebola screening guidelines at airports and discusses the case of Thomas Eric Duncan, who was the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. It highlights the uncertainty surrounding whether Duncan had a fever when he arrived in the United States and mentions the existing airport screenings in West Africa and other countries.

Context: The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says the mosquito-borne disease was confirmed last week in a 3-year-old miniature horse in Pine City. Officials say it’s the first equine case of West Nile in Minnesota this year. The stallion had no record of being vaccinated against the disease. A mare and a foal also living on the property are currently healthy. Equine program manager Courtney Wheeler says the case is a reminder for owners to have their horses vaccinated against the disease. The last confirmed case of West Nile in a Minnesota horse was November 2017. Infected horses can be anorexic and show neurologic signs or behavior changes. Reducing exposure to mosquitoes also can reduce disease risk.

### Input:
Context: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that consumers avoid using vaping products that contain THC, the high-inducing component of marijuana. This recommendation comes as the CDC and state health officials investigate a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, which has resulted in 805 confirmed and probable cases and 12 deaths so far. According to CDC research, 77% of the patients who knew about the substances used in their vaping products reported using THC-containing vapes. However, some users also reported using e-cigarettes with just nicotine, so the investigation is not solely focused on THC products. The CDC is still unsure about the exact cause of the illness and whether it is related to specific solvents or adulterants, or if it stems from a single supplier or multiple ones. 

Data from Wisconsin and Illinois showed that although no single brand name was reported by all patients, two-thirds of consumers reported using a prefilled THC cartridge under the brand name ""Dank Vapes."" A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that more than half of lung illness patients interviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois reported using the ""Dank Vapes"" brand. 

Overall, the CDC's recommendation against using vapes with THC is based on the large number of cases related to the use of this marijuana ingredient. However, the investigation is ongoing, and the CDC is still trying to determine the exact cause of the respiratory illness and whether it is linked to specific products or suppliers.

### Input:
Context: The article discusses the challenges faced by the central German city of Ruesselsheim in its plan to build 1,300 electric car charging points by 2020. The city has received a government grant of 12.8 million euros to fund the project, but officials anticipate delays due to red tape, shortages of qualified staff, and the complexity of civil engineering and power grid overloads. The article highlights the growing number of electric cars in Germany and Europe, but notes that the charging infrastructure is not keeping pace with the demand. This could potentially hinder sales and the European Union's plan to become ""carbon neutral"" by 2050. The lack of off-street parking in some areas is also mentioned as a deterrent for drivers to switch to electric cars. Ruesselsheim aims to provide one charging point per 72 people, the highest level in Europe, with the help of carmaker Opel and the local RheinMain University. However, the installation of each charging point requires approval from various authorities and charging equipment makers have long lead times. The article also mentions the complications of different charging and payment processes across the country, as well as the funding challenges faced by Germany and other countries in expanding the charging infrastructure. The reluctance of energy providers to invest in the infrastructure while car sales remain low is highlighted as a potential obstacle. Without a sufficient number of charging stations, customers may be hesitant to switch to electric cars, creating a vicious circle. The article concludes by stating that the legislation supported by Senator McCain would give the federal government the authority to surveil American citizens without any suspicion of terrorist activities or criminal behavior.
Claim: The legislation ... that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity.
