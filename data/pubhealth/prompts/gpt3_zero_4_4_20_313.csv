0,Weight loss can be boosted fivefold thanks to novel mental imagery technique,"Both MI and FIT rely on patients engaging in multiple sessions with a trained therapist. Whether done in a for-profit country like the United States or a country that partially or fully subsidizes health care, there are cost considerations. The cost of those sessions, and follow-up consultations, was not mentioned. The release describes benefits in terms of kilograms lost at six months and twelve months after the FIT/MI intervention. Benefits are also described in terms of centimeters lost from their waist circumference. This information would have been more meaningful if it had provided information about the starting weight and waist circumference for the groups, since that would have shed light on whether one group would find it more difficult to shed kilograms or centimeters. Some forms of weight loss can pose risks for patients, such as various fad diets or when people with a sedentary lifestyle suddenly begin engaging in rigorous exercise. But this study does not appear to have evaluated how people tried to lose weight, instead focusing on the extent to which they were motived to make changes based on the intervention. Because of the nature of the study, we’ll rate this as not applicable. However, it would have been valuable to include language encouraging people to talk to a health care provider before making abrupt changes to their lifestyle. The release does a fairly good job of describing the study design. However, as noted above, some crucial information is missing. Did the FIT and MI groups have comparable numbers of men and women? Were the groups comparable in age? Were the groups comparable in terms of overall health? Essentially, the release should make clear whether the researchers were comparing apples and oranges. What’s more, it would be important to know what steps the people in each group took to lose weight. If both groups consisted of comparable demographics AND both consisted solely of people who started watching what they ate and engaging in more light exercise, then the hypothesis holds that FIT was responsible for the difference in outcomes. But even if both groups were comparable demographically, but one group happened to adopt a different weight loss approach, that could account for the difference. In other words, it’s possible that some unknown variable was responsible for the FIT group’s success — because it’s not clear whether the study controlled for that. The release specifically notes that the study did not dictate how study participants chose to lose weight. But the study should still have tracked what those efforts looked like, in order to determine FIT’s role in the weight loss. Weight loss is not inherently good. The release refers, once, to study participants as being “overweight,” but it’s not clear what they mean. Are these people who could stand to lose a pound or two? Or are they morbidly obese? It is possible to be both healthy and “overweight,” depending on how you define those terms. In the paper, they define “overweight” as having a body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 25. Having a BMI of 25 puts you exactly on the borderline between “normal” and “overweight” — and the BMI itself is a very incomplete means of measuring an individual’s body fat and assessing health. The funding source is clearly identified. There are no apparent conflicts of interest, though the release would have been stronger if it had addressed this directly. The release addresses this, sort of, when it states: “Most people agree that in order to lose weight, you need to eat less and exercise more, but in many cases, people simply aren’t motivated enough to heed this advice – however much they might agree with it. So FIT comes in with the key aim of encouraging someone to come up with their own imagery of what change might look and feel like to them, how it might be achieved and kept up, even when challenges arise.” That’s enough to earn it a satisfactory ranking, particularly since it is consistent with the underlying study. However, it would be more valuable to see how effective FIT is when used in conjunction with proven weight loss techniques. The release describes FIT as a “new motivational intervention.” Is it in widespread use? How difficult would it be for someone to find a practice that can provide FIT for weight loss? The release doesn’t address this. The release refers to FIT as “novel” and “new” — but (as noted above), researchers have been publishing on FIT since at least May 2016. We’ll give the release the benefit of the doubt here since reasonable people can disagree on what constitutes novelty or “new-ness.” This 2016 paper looked at the use of FIT to inform dietary choices for people who wanted to lose weight. The new paper appears to be the first to look specifically at weight loss, but that context is missing since the release does not place the work in context with other research in the field. The release avoids unjustifiable language.",mixture,"The news release focuses on a study reporting that overweight individuals who engaged in functional imagery training (FIT) were more successful at losing weight than individuals who engaged in a type of talk therapy called motivational interviewing (MI). However, the release does not answer many questions that are relevant to determining how useful FIT is for weight loss. For example, because the study does not appear to have collected information on diet or exercise, it’s not clear whether the difference in outcomes stems from differences in lifestyle choices made by study participants. It would have been helpful if the release (and study) had analyzed specifically how increased motivation and lifestyle choices can result in weight loss. The published study notes that data relating to “participants’ experiences and process variables, including frequency of motivational cognitions, self-efficacy for diet and physical activity, self-reported diet and physical activity” were collected but that the results would be reported separately. When comparing the efficacy of MI and FIT, it’s important to know what sort of lifestyle changes study participants made. If a significant percentage of participants who engaged in FIT also joined a for-profit diet program, that support system might explain the differing results. By the same token, it’s not clear if the MI group and the FIT group were matched for initial weight, sex or age — any of which could influence how much weight was lost. Without knowledge of those details, it is difficult or impossible to say how much more effective FIT was than MI (if at all). According to the published research, there were some differences in full-time employment and the range in baseline weight that weren’t addressed in the limitations section of the study and which could affect the reliability of the data.","

This release does a good job of describing a study that found that a new motivational intervention (FIT) was more effective than traditional motivational interviewing (MI) in helping people lose weight. However, the release does not provide enough information about the study design, such as the starting weight and waist circumference of the groups, or what steps the people in each group took to lose weight. It also does not address the cost of the intervention, or how widely available FIT is. Finally, the release does not place the work in context with other research in the field.","Context:

1,"A video shows a sick, possibly starving polar bear on Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic.","In December 2017, a viral video left millions of people saddened and horrified by the sight of an emaciated polar bear forced to scavenge in trash cans for food on Canada’s Baffin Island. Photographer Paul Nicklen posted the video on Facebook, garnering almost 30,000 shares within a week, as well as the attention of the national news media. Nicklen, who is also co-founder of the environmental nonprofit group SeaLegacy, wrote: My entire Sea Legacy team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear. It’s a soul-crushing scene that still haunts me, but I know we need to share both the beautiful and the heartbreaking if we are going to break down the walls of apathy. This is what starvation looks like. The muscles atrophy. No energy. It’s a slow, painful death. When scientists say polar bears will be extinct in the next 100 years, I think of the global population of 25,000 bears dying in this manner. There is no band aid solution. There was no saving this individual bear. People think that we can put platforms in the ocean or we can feed the odd starving bear. The simple truth is this — if the Earth continues to warm, we will lose bears and entire polar ecosystems. The video was subsequently shared by National Geographic, which reported: Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear’s back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. The footage is real. Nicklen says it was captured “a few months” before December 2017, at an abandoned Inuit camp on Baffin Island, the enormous land mass southwest of Greenland in the Canadian Arctic. There appears to be no doubt that the animal is suffering from starvation, as National Geographic wrote: The bear’s thin frame and protruding bones are clear indicators of this, and its atrophied muscles suggest it’s been starving for an extended period of time. However, the causes of the bear’s condition were a little bit more complicated. Polar bears live only in the Arctic and eat only meat, their main source being seals. They rely on Arctic seawater to freeze into ice, where they can gain access to seals. But climate change means that these Arctic ice sheets are reducing in size, lowering the number of seals available to polar bears and ultimately, causing them to starve. The risk is higher in places like Baffin Island, where polar bears depend on seasonal ice. According to the Smithsonian Institution, the issue is likely about to become dramatically worse: Recent predictions suggest that warming seawater and air will melt 20 percent or more of the Arctic’s ice cover in the next 40 years — a scary statistic for the many species in the Arctic that rely on seasonal ice cover for vital activities such as breeding and eating. However, Dr. Steven Amstrup, chief scientist for the non-profit Polar Bears International, said in a blog post that climate change may not have been the direct or sole contributing factor in this particular animal’s demise: Polar bears have few natural predators. Although they normally live a long time, they are not immortal. All eventually die and most do so because they have not been able to capture enough food. This means that malnutrition is a major cause of death for polar bears. Young bears that have not learned well enough how to catch seals, old feeble bears, and bears that have injured themselves, all can succumb to malnutrition under some circumstances. The starvation leading to the event shown in this video could be related to old age, injury (like a broken jaw or teeth that prevent it from catching food), disease, or other factors limiting its success in obtaining prey. However, Amstrup points out that the continued diminishment of sea ice that is expected will make it harder for polar bears in this region to find seals to eat, and therefore make starvation much more likely for sick, lame, very young or very old animals who might otherwise have survived: The problem is that an ever-warmer future means polar bears will have less and less access to their seal prey, so the rate at which bears die from malnutrition/starvation will increase. So, regardless of the proximate cause of this bear’s condition, this heart-wrenching footage provides us with a warning about the future. Hunters from Inuit communities on Baffin Island were also skeptical over whether to link the bear’s condition with climate change; Eric Ootoovak, the vice-chair of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization, said of the bear: You can really tell he’s sick. He’s not starving. If he was starving, he’d be able to move a bit more than that. Nick Arnalukjuak, who leads a similar group in the island community of Nunavut, called it part of a “normal cycle” for some bears to suffer injury or illness, adding:",true,"We don’t have starving polar bears, we don’t have polar bears facing hard times because of ice. As long as we have four seasons — spring, summer, fall, winter — nothing’s going to change.","

2,"Maj. Nidal Hasan, the man accused of the Fort Hood shootings, ""was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration.","Since the shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, on Nov. 5, 2009, we've been inundated with e-mails about a purported link between President Barack Obama's administration and Maj. Nidal Hasan, the Army psychiatrist suspected of the shootings. Here are a few lines from one of the many versions of the e-mail we received: ""It’s been a pretty incredible week and I don’t mean in a good way. But today we have been given a glimpse into the New World Order and it’s pretty scary,"" the e-mail begins. After complaining that Obama is pursuing a Muslim agenda, the e-mail says, ""Did you know that Major Hassan was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration? No? Neither did I until my wife found information on line and followed the evidence to the source documents!"" Our friends over at National Public Radio already checked out a version of this claim. The rumor, NPR concluded, started with Jerome Corsi, a writer for World Net Daily and author of The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality . The e-mails we were sent linked to the Corsi story as well. ""Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the alleged shooter in yesterday's massacre at Fort Hood, played a homeland security advisory role in President Barack Obama's transition into the White House, according to a key university policy institute document,"" Corsi wrote. (We've checked three Corsi claims before and rated two False and one .) The story links to a document published by the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., titled ""Thinking Anew—Security Priorities for the Next Administration."" It is the proceedings from a series of meetings of the organization's Presidential Task Force. On page 29 of the paper, Hasan is listed as a participant; he was one of more than 300 officials, reporters and Capitol Hill aides who signed up for the conference. In a statement, the think tank confirmed that the Hasan listed as a participant is the same Hasan accused of the Fort Hood shootings. But the statement also makes an important point: Hasan registered for the event on his own. He was not invited, and he attended only as an audience member in his capacity as a psychiatry fellow at the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine. ""All of these events were open to the public,"" the statement reads. ""At no time has Nidal Hasan been affiliated with [the Homeland Security Policy Institute] or The George Washington University."" So, Hasan chose to attend a conference relevant to his field, much like a doctor would attend a conference about diabetes, for example. But here's the more important point: The task force has nothing to do with the White House, according to Sharon Cardash, associate director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute. ""HSPI's Presidential Transition Task Force is not and was not affiliated at all with the White House,"" she wrote us in an e-mail. ""The Task Force was created prior to the election; and was not formed at the request of any administration."" Indeed, HSPI established the transition task force in April 2008, before Obama was in office, let alone the Democratic presidential nominee. In a city where policy papers are published nearly every day, the work done by the group no more advised the Obama administration than any of the other papers that came out before or after GWU's. Corsi actually makes this point farther down in his story, which contradicts his headline: ""While the GWU task force participants included several members of government, including representatives of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, there is no indication in the document that the group played any formal role in the official Obama transition, other than to serve in a university-based advisory capacity."" And in an editor's note to the story, Corsi writes that, ""Hasan is being reported as a participant in the GWU Homeland Security Policy Institute's Presidential Transition Task Force, not as a member, noting the group was a university think-tank, not part of the Obama administration official transition team."" But it appears that disclaimer came later, and that it failed to stop the avalanche of e-mails spreading the inaccurate report. Hasan attended a meeting on a subject relevant to his profession, that much is clear. But beyond that, there's nothing to back up the chain e-mail's accusation that he somehow was ""an ADVISOR"" to the Obama administration or that GWU's task force was involved in the new White House. In fact, the group's work began long before Obama took office and is in no way affiliated with the White House.

3,A morgue worker was accidentally cremated while napping or pretending to be dead.,"On 1 March 2017, the web site World News Daily Report (WNDR) reported that Beaumont, Texas, morgue worker Henri Paul Johnson was inadvertently incinerated by a coworker as he napped on the job: An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning, after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap one a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Also depicted in the article was Jenna Davis, a coworker who purportedly heard Johnson’s death screams: Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.” As is the case with all content published by WNDR, a fake news site, there was no truth to the story. The article’s photograph of the supposedly deceased morgue worker “Henri Paul Johnson” was actually a picture of a DeSoto County constable Christopher Plumlee, who was arrested in 2015 for DUI. And the photograph of coworker “Jenna Davis” was actually a picture of forensic pathologist Dr. Lisa Funte, taken from a May 2012 Beaumont Enterprise profile of her. Variations: The story was reposted by a site spoofing ABC News (abcnews-us.com) in December 2017 and March 2018: An employee of a local Huntersville funeral home died this morning, after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Huntersville medical examiner, 48-year old Kenneth Brooks decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Although names and locations in the article changed, the basic premise (and its lack of veracity) remained the same. The image reproduced above accompanied the story and was taken from a March 2016 WREG report about a funeral home in Atlanta which had nothing to do with a morgue employee who was “accidentally cremated.” In April 2018, the fake news site 8shit.net repurposed this story as an April Fool’s prank in which a morgue employee pretending to be dead was cremated by co-workers: It’s April Fools. Everyone wants to prank their friends, family and even customers, but this man got it very wrong. 27-year old Thomas McClure is now an ex-employee of a morgue in Boston, after he tried to prank his coworkers by pretending he was dead. To achieve his goal, he took an overdose of sleeping pills, with the idea that he was gonna be so unconscious that there would be no way to wake him up. And everything went exactly as planned: He took the pills in the morning and started doing his job. A few minutes later, he fell asleep on the floor and no one was able to wake him up. They tried pouring water on his face, slapping him, but nothing worked. The prank worked like a charm, and all the employees were sad because they thought their friend was dead. Unfortunately, they reached to the conclusion that he was, indeed, dead, and decided to cremate him.",false,"""While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory.""","

4,"Reusing, freezing, or warming plastic water bottles will cause them to break down into carcinogenic compounds or release dioxins.","Sorting out the various claims made about potential health issues associated with plastic water bottles is a difficult process, both because so many different claims about them are circulated and because the generic term “plastic bottle” can in fact refer to any one of several different types of bottles with distinctly different chemical properties. [Collected via e-mail, 2007] No water bottles in freezer. A dioxin chemical causes cancer, especially breast cancer. Dioxins are highly poisonous to the cells of our bodies. Don’t freeze your plastic bottles with water in them as this releases dioxins from the plastic. [Collected via e-mail, 2004] Many are unaware of poisoning caused by re-using plastic bottles. Some of you may be in the habit of using and re-using your disposable mineral water bottles (eg. Evian, Aqua, Ice Mountain, Vita, etc), keeping them in your car or at work. Not a good idea. In a nutshell, the plastic (called polyethylene terephthalate or PET) used in these bottles contains a potentially carcinogenic element (something called diethylhydroxylamine or DEHA). The bottles are safe for one-time use only; if you must keep them longer, it should be or no more than a few days, a week max, and keep them away from heat as well. Repeated washing and rinsing can cause the plastic to break down and the carcinogens (cancer-causing chemical agents) can leach into the water that YOU are drinking. Better to invest in water bottles that are really meant for multiple uses. This is not something we should be scrimping on. Those of you with family — please advise them, especially for their children’s sake. [Collected via e-mail, 2007] Do Not Drink Water Bottles Left in the Car This information was given to me by my husband and I know all the ladies in my life should know and please forward it to all the ladies in your life. My husband has a friend whose mother recently got diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor told her women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. The doctor said that the heat and the plastic of the bottle have certain chemicals that can lead to breast cancer. So please be careful and do not drink that water bottle that has been left in a car and pass this on to all the women in your life. [Collected via e-mail, 2009] On the Ellen show, Sheryl Crow said this is what caused her breast cancer. It has been identified as the most common cause of the high levels of dioxin in breast cancer tissue. Sheryl Crow’s oncologist told her: women should not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. The heat reacts with the chemicals in the plastic of the bottle which releases dioxin into the water. Dioxin is a toxin increasingly found in breast cancer tissue. So please be careful and do not drink bottled water that has been left in a car. Pass this on to all the women in your life. Don’t leave water in the car!! pic.twitter.com/o75cDhX11m — APRIIL (@aprilmartinez__) October 3, 2019 Water, soda, and juice are typically sold in bottles made from polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET or PETE. These containers are intended to be disposable, single-use bottles, although many consumers wash them and re-use them to hold drinking water or other beverages. Some of the example items reproduced above claim that freezing or re-using PET bottles releases unsafe levels of carcinogens such as “dioxins” or the plastics additive DEHA (diethylhydroxylamine) into whatever liquids they may contain. However, according to the American Chemistry Council, such claims are inaccurate on two counts: DEHA is not used in the manufacture of PET bottles (nor is it created through the breakdown of such bottles), and DEHA is not classified as a human carcinogen: DEHA is neither regulated nor classified as a human carcinogen by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the National Toxicology Program or the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the leading authorities on carcinogenic substances. In 1991, on the basis of very limited data, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified DEHA as a “possible human carcinogen.” However, in 1995, EPA again evaluated the science and concluded that ” … overall, the evidence is too limited to establish that DEHA is likely to cause cancer.” Further, DEHA is not inherent in PET as a raw material, byproduct or decomposition product. Moreover, DEHA has been cleared by FDA for food-contact applications and would not pose a health risk even if it were present. Finally, in June 2003, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research conducted a scientific study of migration in new and reused plastic water bottles from three countries. The Swiss study did not find DEHA at concentrations significantly above the background levels detected in distilled water, indicating DEHA was unlikely to have migrated from the bottles. The study concluded that the levels of DEHA were distinctly below the World Health Organization guidelines for safe drinking water. The American Cancer Society also debunked such claims, stating: In fact, DEHA is not inherent in the plastic used to make these bottles, and even if it was the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says DEHA “cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer, teratogenic effects, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, gene mutations, liver, kidney, reproductive, or developmental toxicity or other serious or irreversible chronic health effects.” Meanwhile, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), says diethylhexyl adipate “is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.” As for the notion that freezing water in plastic bottles releases dioxin, the American Chemical Council asserted: There simply is no scientific basis to support the claim that PET bottles will release dioxin when frozen. Dioxins are a family of chemical compounds that are produced by combustion at extremely high temperatures. They can only be formed at temperatures well above 700 degrees Fahrenheit; they cannot be formed at room temperature or in freezing temperatures. Moreover, there is no reasonable scientific basis for expecting dioxins to be present in plastic food or beverage containers in the first place. Johns Hopkins researcher Dr. Rolf Halden also said of such claims that: Q: What do you make of this recent email warning that claims dioxins can be released by freezing water in plastic bottles? A: This is an urban legend. There are no dioxins in plastics. In addition, freezing actually works against the release of chemicals. Chemicals do not diffuse as readily in cold temperatures, which would limit chemical release if there were dioxins in plastic, and we don’t think there are. Dr. Halden did note that drinking water from plastic bottles that had been exposed to high temperatures could be problematic, though: There is another group of chemicals, called phthalates that are sometimes added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle. Phthalates are environmental contaminants that can exhibit hormone-like behavior by acting as endocrine disruptors in humans and animals. If you heat up plastics, you could increase the leaching of phthalates from the containers into water and food. Another common type of plastic bottle is made with bisphenol A, also known as BPA. These products are typically rigid plastic bottles intended for multiple re-use, such as baby bottles or water bottles carried by cyclists. Concerns about tests that may link BPA ingestion with cancer and reproductive damage in some animals and the possibility that BPA could leach out of plastic bottles and into the liquids they contain has led to bans on the use of BPA in plastic products intended for children (such as baby bottles), and has prompted some consumers to seek out non-BPA alternatives.",mixture,What's false: Reusing single-use PET bottles doesn't cause them to release carcinogenic DEHA into the fluids they contain; freezing plastic water bottles doesn't cause them to release carcinogenic dioxins into the fluids they contain. What's undetermined: Whether heating some types of plastic bottles could increase the leaching of harmful phthalates into the fluids they contain.,"

Claims that freezing or re-using PET bottles releases unsafe levels of carcinogens such as “dioxins” or the plastics additive DEHA (diethylhydroxylamine) into whatever liquids they may contain are inaccurate. DEHA is not used in the manufacture of PET bottles, nor is it created through the breakdown of such bottles, and DEHA is not classified as a human carcinogen. Meanwhile, there is no scientific basis to support the claim that PET bottles will release dioxin when frozen. As for BPA, concerns about tests that may link BPA ingestion with cancer and reproductive damage in some animals and the possibility that BPA could leach out of plastic bottles and into

5,"The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly)"" is the ""DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women.","There are many unanswered questions about the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly, a birth defect in which the baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Not every baby of an infected woman develops this syndrome, and the mechanism by which the virus might affect the fetus is uncertain. But moving around on the Internet is an entirely different take on the tie between Zika and microcephaly. It doesn’t exist, according to certain blogs, tweets and articles on conspiracy-leaning websites. The Canadian-based Centre for Research on Globalization, a group that advances ideas it feels the ""mainstream press"" ignores, had an article Feb. 4, 2016, from Dr. Gary Kohls that challenged the linkage theory and said the primary suspect is DTaP, a common vaccination to prevent whooping cough (along with tetanus and diphtheria). ""In the whole week of reports that I heard or read about, not a single interviewer asked about – and not a single ‘expert’ or mainstream journalists ever mentioned the most likely triggering cause of the epidemic, and that is the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, genotoxic, aluminum that was in every DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated (early in 2015) by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women – and therefore into their fetuses,"" Kohls wrote. So is DTaP is the ""most likely triggering cause"" of microcephaly? Most of Kohls’ article describes why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pharmaceutical companies and researchers would care to blame the Zika virus rather than the vaccine, but its main point is the overlap of the microcephaly incidence and Brazil’s immunization campaign. Brazil did begin vaccinating pregnant women starting in late 2014. (Hat tip to Brazilian fact-checker Cristina Tardáguila at Lupa News.) However, according to the Brazilian Health Department press release, the vaccine they distributed was a version called Tdap. This was part of an international push to reduce whooping cough in infants. Inoculating mothers late in pregnancy allowed them to pass antibodies to their unborn children. For the rest of this fact-check, we look at Tdap. The Web article named the incorrect vaccine, but if there’s any merit to Kohls’ case -- and there isn’t -- it lies with the vaccine Brazil used. Kohl also wrote that ""there are 35 other countries across the globe that have confirmed cases of Zika virus illness, but none are having any microcephaly reports."" The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control does show about that number of countries and territories where Zika has been found, but in 13 of those places, there are few cases. Either no instances of Zika have been found in the past two months, or the number of cases was less than 10. So it’s a bit misleading to suggest that the absence of microcephaly disproves the link between the birth defect and the Zika virus. If we find more detailed statistics on the number of cases of Zika and microcephaly, we’ll update this item, but there’s a much bigger problem with Kohls’ statement. Evidence on the safety of Tdap The weakest part of the argument that Tdap plays a role in microcephaly is that pregnant women in the United States, and elsewhere, have been getting the vaccine and there is no hint of a connection to microcephaly. Elyse Kharbanda is a top national researcher on vaccine safety at HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research in Minneapolis. ""Our research has not shown any link between Tdap vaccination in pregnant women and microcephaly in their children,"" Kharbanda told us. Melissa Brower in the CDC press office reiterated that point. ""Our safety monitoring is continuous,"" Brower said. ""We have not observed any unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that would indicate a potential safety problem with maternal Tdap vaccination and microcephaly as a birth outcome."" A 2015 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association included over 29,000 pregnant women in six states. It found no problems of any birth defects for any woman who was vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy. Another JAMA study looked at over 26,000 pregnant women in California and reached the same conclusion. Researchers at the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program further affirm the safety of Tdap. Director and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases Buddy Creech said nothing shows any link between the vaccine and microcephaly or any other birth defect. Creech also noted that the vaccine is given later in pregnancy, between weeks 27 and 36. That timing is important. ""Most organ development and structural changes are occurring in the first trimester,"" Creech said. ""It’s after the period of most intense organ development, so it removes the question of whether a vaccine caused congenital heart disease, etc."" However, the CDC says in some cases, microcephaly can occur after the first trimester, so in theory, a vaccination could overlap with the onset of microcephaly. But that doesn’t change the rest of the research pattern. The United Kingdom launched a vaccination program in 2012, making Tdap available to about 700,000 pregnant women. Researchers looked at the impact on about 20,000 of them and found no increase in pregnancy risks. On a related note, the New England Journal of Medicine reports that the Zika virus was found in the brain tissue of an aborted fetus suffering from microcephaly. While this says nothing about the role of Tdap, it does directly link the Zika virus to a particular birth defect. We contacted the editors at the Centre for Research on Globalization and they said they forwarded our questions to Kohls. If we hear back, we’ll update this item. Our ruling An online article on the website of the Centre for Research of Globalization said the DTaP vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in Brazil. First of all, Brazil used Tdap, a slightly different version of the vaccine. More important, not a bit of evidence supports the assertion that either variety lies behind microcephaly. Many thousands of pregnant women in the United States and around the world have been getting this vaccine for at least five years and multiple studies have found no ill effects on their babies. Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly.

6,Genes offer predictions on leukemia,"More than 100 fires are ablaze in New South Wales and Victoria states, many of which have been burning for several weeks and including a single blaze that stretches more than 60 km (37.2 miles) in a national park north of Sydney. Conditions are expected to worsen from Tuesday, when temperatures are forecast to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and winds are expected to start picking up. “We are expecting to see across large geographic areas high fire dangers,” Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney. “Firefighters are doing kilometers and kilometers of back burning operations, containment line establishment and consolidation.” Wildfires have killed at least four people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burned more than 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) of bushland across eastern Australia since the start of November. Bushfires are common in Australia’s hot, dry summers, but the ferocity and early arrival of the fires in the southern spring is unprecedented. Experts have said climate change has left bushland tinder-dry. Stoked by strong winds, several fires have combined into a single massive blaze that is threatening the region of Hawkesbury, about 50 km north west of Sydney. Authorities have warned the blaze is unlikely to be extinguished until meaningful rain arrives - which is not expected for at least three months - and forecasts indicate the fire could be pushed towards larger population areas. “The big danger is if the winds come from the west and that’s exactly what is forecast,” Hawkesbury City Mayor Barry Calvert told Reuters. “People are trying to clear their gutters, clean up the leaves on the ground, anything they can do to keep their properties safe.” Calvert said many locals were struggling to move animals and livestock in an area renowned for breeding racehorses. “We’ve opened the showground for people to move their animals, but many people here may have 20 horses and only two horse boxes so they can’t move them quickly,” Calvert told Reuters. The wildfires have blanketed Sydney - home to more than 5 million people - in smoke and ash for more than two weeks, turning the daytime sky orange, obscuring visibility and prompting commuters to wear breathing masks. The city, usually known for its sea breezes, clear skies and beach-dotted coastline, has made several appearances in the top ten lists of the most polluted cities in the world.

8,"African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but ""wind up going to prison six times more.","After two black men died at the hands of police, CNN commentator Van Jones tried to make a case for institutional racism in law enforcement with panelist Harry Houck, a former New York Police Department detective, during the July 7 edition of Erin Burnett Outfront. ""The statistics don't lie about the excessive numbers of stops,"" said Jones, who is black. ""Let's not talk about traffic stops. Let's take something tough like drugs. African-Americans don't use drugs (at a) higher level than whites. (It's) about the same percentage; about 12 percent. But we wind up getting arrested, not 50 percent more. We wind up going to prison six times more because there seems to be some institutional bias. Doesn't that bother you?"" Houck's response: ""That doesn't show any institutional bias."" We were interested in Jones' statement that blacks don't use drugs at a higher level than whites, yet they the wind up going to prison six times more often. We fact-checked a similar statement in February 2016, when presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared that ""African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do."" We rated that statement True. But Jones' comment was less generic, dealing specifically with drugs. When we contacted him, he said he was going away for a while and couldn't remember the source off the top of his head. So we went looking for information. Jones may have been referring to data contained in the 2014 National Research Council report on ""Growth of Incarceration in the United States: Exploring Causes and Consequences."" Pages 60 and 61 focus on drug crimes. We'll talk about drug use first. The report says, ""The prevalence of drug use is only slightly higher among blacks than whites for some illicit drugs and slightly lower for others; the difference is not substantial. There is also little evidence, when all drug types are considered, that blacks sell drugs more often than whites."" We checked the overall data from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Here's the breakdown for all illicit drugs. There are racial differences in the types of drugs being abused, according to surveys by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Blacks, for example, are far less likely to have used marijuana, cocaine and hallucinogens in their lifetime than whites, but — at least in the case of marijuana — whites are more likely to give it up over time. With that backdrop, the National Research Council report says, ""In recent years, drug-related arrest rates for blacks have been three to four times higher than those for whites. In the late 1980s, the rates were six times higher for blacks than for whites."" Here's the drug arrest rate trend: But Jones was talking about the rates of imprisonment for drug crimes, not arrest rates. Those numbers turned out to be harder to find. We turned to Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst for The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group in Washington. She pointed us to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reporting on the number of people going to state prison for drug offenses and numbers from the United States Sentencing Commission on the racial makeup of drug offenders going to federal prison. Those numbers aren't perfect for our comparison. For example, the state prison data only lists inmates based on their most serious offense, so someone convicted of a drug crime may not be listed in that category if that person was given a longer sentence for assault. Adjusting for the number of blacks and whites (another approximation because many Americans are of mixed race), the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites. That's very close to what Jones said. It should be noted that these numbers vary from source to source. The NAACP's Criminal Justice Fact Sheet asserts that ""five times as many whites are using drugs as African Americans, yet African Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of whites."" It doesn't list a source. Spokeswoman Raquel Coombs said the ratios may be out of date. We noted in the BJS data that the racial disparity has decreased significantly since 1991. That NAACP 10 percent imprisonment statistic appears to be based on 2003 data analyzed in 2009 by Human Rights Watch. (We also note that the drug-use statistic is easy to misread. Whites aren't five times more likely to use drugs. Five times more whites are using drugs because there are about 5.5 times more whites in the U.S. population than blacks.) We wondered why so many more blacks are going to prison for drug offenses. They're more likely to get caught selling drugs, as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. ""Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest."" Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along. As we found in our previous fact-check, their sentences also tend to be longer. Our ruling Jones said that African-Americans don't use drugs at a higher level than whites but wind up going to prison six times more. African-Americans use drugs at roughly the same levels as white Americans, although overall illicit drug use among blacks has been marginally higher than for whites, with some differences in the types of drugs used, according to a national surveys. Jones' bigger point was about the disparity in sentencing, and the rate of African-Americans' incarceration for drug offenses is very close to what Jones said.

9,Deborah Harry was nearly abducted by serial killer Ted Bundy in New York and narrowly escaped with her life.,"Deborah Harry, the lead singer of the 1970s new wave band Blondie, has maintained many times over the last three decades that she once had a close encounter with Ted Bundy, narrowly escaping abduction (and presumably worse) at the hands of that notorious serial killer in the streets of New York in the early 1970s. Here’s how the story was related by her early on, in a 1989 newspaper account: The way Deborah Harry recounts the story is absolutely frightening. The rock singer, best known for her work in the post-disco, New-wave band Blondie, was just trying to hail a cab. It nearly ended in disaster. “I was trying to get a cab on the lower east side of the Village in New York, and it was kind of late,” Harry said. “This was back in the early ’70s. I wasn’t even in a band then … I was trying to get across town to an after-hours club … “A little white car pulls up, and the guy offers me a ride. So I just continued to try to flag a cab down. But he was very persistent, and he asked where I was going. It was only a couple of blocks away, and he said, ‘Well I’ll give you a ride.’ “I got in the car, and it was summertime and the windows were all rolled up except about an inch and a half at the top. So I was sitting there and he wasn’t really talking to me. Automatically, I sort of reached to roll down the window and I realized there was no door handle, no window crank, no nothing. The inside of the car was totally stripped out. ” … I got very nervous. I reached my arm out through the little crack and stretched down and opened the car from the outside. As soon as he saw that, he tried to turn the corner really fast, and I spun out of the car and landed in the middle of the street.” The driver, Harry concluded more than 15 years later, was serial killer Ted Bundy, who was executed last January [1989] in Florida’s electric chair. “It was right after his execution that I read about him,” she said. “I hadn’t thought about that incident in years. The whole description of how he operated and what he looked like and the kind of car he drove and the time frame he was doing that in that area of the country fit exactly. I said, ‘My God, it was him. '” Harry said it frightens her more now than ever. “Very scary,” she said. “Truthfully, I hadn’t thought of the incident in 15 years. I’m one of the lucky ones.” Between the incident and the time she fully digested what had happened, Harry had come and gone as a music superstar. However, Debbie Harry’s recollections (related many years after the fact) don’t fit the details of what is known about Ted Bundy’s life and criminal activities. For example, her 1989 account opened as follows: “I was trying to get a cab on the lower east side of the Village in New York, and it was kind of late,” Harry said. “This was back in the early ’70s. I wasn’t even in a band then … I was trying to get across town to an after-hours club … Ted Bundy was born to an unwed mother on 24 November 1946 in Burlington, Vermont, he lived in his grandparents’ Philadelphia home for the first three years of his life, and then moved with his mother to Tacoma, Washington. After graduating high school in 1965, he spent the summer working for the Tacoma City Light utility company to save money for college, attended the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma during the 1965-66 academic year. The next summer he worked at a Washington sawmill, then transferred to the University of Washington (UW) to study Chinese before dropping out of that school in early 1968. After leaving UW, Bundy worked at various minimum wage jobs in Washington state, served as a volunteer in the Seattle office of Nelson Rockefeller’s presidential campaign, traveled to Colorado, visited relatives in Arkansas and Philadelphia (enrolling for one semester at Temple University), and possibly undertook a trek to Burlington to obtain a copy of his birth certificate, before returning to Washington by the fall of 1969 to re-enroll at UW as a psychology major. He remained in the Pacific Northwest, attending school and/or working in the area (committing his first documented assaults and murders in Washington and Oregon in early 1974), until relocating to Salt Lake City to attend the University of Utah Law School around August 1974. In January 1975 Bundy visited Seattle briefly during a school break before returning to the Utah-Colorado area. He was finally arrested (for the first time) in a Salt Lake City suburb in August 1975 and convicted of kidnapping and assault (for the first time) in Colorado in March 1976. So here we come to the first problem with Harry’s tale: the chronology just doesn’t work. Ted Bundy is not known to have been in New York City in the early 1970s (or at any other time in his life), nor to have begun abducting and killing women prior to early 1974 (and then only in the Washington-Oregon and Utah-Colorado-Idaho areas until after he escaped from a Colorado jail at the end of 1977 and fled to Florida, where he attacked and killed more women before his re-arrest in February 1978). Given that Harry maintains her encounter with the mystery man who offered her a ride took place in the “lower east side of the Village” in the “early ’70s” when she “wasn’t even in a band,” that incident must have occurred prior to the end of 1973, as Harry was definitely in a band (the Stillettos) by then. But there’s no evidence that Ted Bundy was either in New York or attempting to abduct women at that time. The other problem with Harry’s account is that Bundy was never known to have driven or used a “totally stripped out” MurderMobile of the type she described, one devoid even of door handles and window cranks. During his Seattle and Salt Lake City murder sprees, he drove a normal-appearing vehicle, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle. The only modification he made to this car was to occasionally remove the passenger seat and place it across the back seat in order to facilitate the carrying of “cargo.” As Ann Rule, author of the Ted Bundy study The Stranger Beside Me noted, young women who later (erroneously) claimed to have narrowly escaped the clutches of Ted Bundy are a not uncommon phenomenon: A dozen or more young women have called me since 1980, absolutely convinced that they had escaped from Ted Bundy. In San Francisco. In Georgia. In Idaho. In Aspen. In Ann Arbor. In Utah … He could not have been everywhere, but, for these women, there are terrified memories of a handsome man in a tan Volkswagen — a man who gave them a ride, and who wanted more. They are sure that it was Ted who reached for them, and declare that they never hitchhiked again. For other women, there is a man with a brilliant smile who came to their door, ingratiating, and then angry when they would not let him in. “It was him. I’ve seen his picture, and I recognized him.” With the advent of computer communication, I have heard from more women who encountered Ted Bundy — and lived to tell about it — than ever before. When I lecture, I recognize the haunted look in the eyes of the women who approach me to tell of remembered terror. Just as in the past, I realize they cannot all have met Ted Bundy. That said, we can’t claim it’s absolutely impossible Deborah Harry could have encountered Ted Bundy in New York in the early 1970s, as his every movement and activity wasn’t thoroughly tracked and documented, and he told conflicting stories to different people about when and where he began assaulting and killing women, as noted by Wikipedia: There is no consensus on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. Also, during his time in Philadelphia and (his claimed time in) Ocean City, Bundy would theoretically have been just a few hours’ drive away from New York City, but still no reliable account — not even his own — ever put him in that metropolis or in possession of the type of stripped-out, death-trap automobile described by Harry. Deborah Harry’s later retellings of the story introduced even more anomalies, such as this account from the 2012 Blondie biography Parallel Lives: “It was late at night and I was trying to get across Houston Street from the Lower East Side to 7th Avenue. For some reason there were no cabs and I was wearing these big platform shoes. This car kept circling round and round, this guy was calling out, ‘Come on, I’ll give you a ride.’ Finally, I gave in and got in the car. I realised I’d made a big mistake. For one, it was very hot in the car, and the windows rolled up nearly to the top. The guy had a white shirt and he was very good looking. Then I realised this guy had the worst BO I have ever smelt. Then I looked over at the door to crank down the window and saw there was no door handle, no crank. I cast my eyes around and saw that the car had been gutted. There was nothing in there. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up, so I stuck my arm out through the crack in the window and managed to open the door from the outside. I was so lucky.” “At the time I didn’t know anything about Ted Bundy,” Deborah later reflected. “I just thought, ‘Thank God I got away from that asshole,’ and I just carried on — and years later, after he was executed, I got on a flight and picked up a Newsweek, and I’m reading this story, and it says ‘Modus Operandi’, and it describes how he looked, the inside of his cars, and the hair on the back of my neck once again went out, and I said, ‘Oh my God, that was Ted Bundy. '” Harry’s remains the sole personal account that ever put Ted Bundy in New York City, pegged him as possessing terrible body odor, or represented him as driving a car with an interior stripped completely bare — which makes it all the more puzzling how she might have read a magazine article describing a detail (e.g., “the [stripped down] inside of his cars”) that no one but she ever reported. Harry summed up the predominant reaction to her tale as follows: “I’ve been debunked, actually, by those people that debunk you, or whatever,” adds Debbie, speaking nearly 40 years after the encounter. “They say he wasn’t in New York at that time, but I think they’re really wrong, because he had escaped and was travelling down the East Coast. I think that nobody has ever really investigated that. I didn’t know until later who it was. It was pretty scary.” Of course, what’s “really wrong” here is that Ted Bundy couldn’t have “escaped” before Deborah Harry claims to have encountered him, because at that time he hadn’t yet ever been jailed, or arrested, or even suspected of a crime. Quite possibly something like Harry’s tale did happen, but it probably didn’t involve the most famous serial killer of the time.",unproven,Details of the Blondie singer's claim of a close encounter with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy in New York don't check out.,"

10,"U.S. Senator Kamala Harris bragged, boasted or laughed about prosecuting a homeless single mother in a January 2010 speech.","In early 2019, California Sen. Kamala Harris became one of the first few Democrats to announce her candidacy for the U.S. presidency in 2020. Her announcement on 21 January prompted the kind of scrutiny and commentary that has become typical when any high-profile politician officially declares designs on the White House. In the case of Harris, some observers focused on her background as the San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, and her reputation as a “law-and-order” prosecutor. As part of this scrutiny, old video footage re-emerged online that some commentators said showed Harris “boasting” and “laughing” about prosecuting poor parents — especially one homeless woman — for the truancy of their children. On 28 January, journalist Walker Bragman posted video clips from a speech Harris delivered in 2010 at the California Commonwealth Club, a public-policy forum: Kamala Harris at an event hosted by the Commonwealth Club in 2010, explaining her decision as San Francisco DA to get tough on truancy. Critics of truancy crackdowns say such efforts unfairly target poor parents and children without actually helping students. pic.twitter.com/GKkDpayxuv — Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) January 28, 2019 These video clips prompted news articles and opinion columns claiming that Harris, purportedly showing a callous and uncaring attitude towards the plight of poor people, had been caught on camera “laughing” and “boasting” about her prosecution of a homeless mother. Fox News posted an article with the headline “2010 video shows Kamala Harris boasting about prosecuting parents, including homeless mom with two jobs, whose kids missed classes.” Nathan Robinson wrote an opinion column for The Guardian with the headline “Kamala Harris laughed about jailing parents over truancy. But it’s not funny”: “Harris cheerfully recounts the story of sending an attorney from her office to intimidate a homeless single mother whose children were missing school. She smiles as she recalls how she instructed her subordinates to ‘look really mean’ so that the mother would take the threat of jail seriously.” The website Grit Post published an article with the headline “Kamala Harris Once Bragged About Prosecuting a Homeless Single Mom Working Two Jobs.” The January 2019 controversy centered on a speech Harris gave on 14 January 2010 at the California Commonwealth Club, at a time when she was the district attorney (D.A.) of San Francisco and was running for California attorney general. She was also promoting her 2009 book Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor’s Plan to Make Us Safer. In her speech, Harris recounted her experiences and record as San Francisco D.A. and advocated a “smart-on-crime” approach to criminal justice, which she outlined as a combination of aggressive prosecution of violent crime, along with with her “Back on Track” program, which was designed to reduce recidivism (re-offending) among 18-24-year-old, first-time, low-level drug offenders, many of whom Harris noted were parents. Harris also spoke about the anti-truancy campaign she led as San Francisco D.A., one that preceded a significant decline in elementary school truancy and absenteeism in San Francisco but attracted some criticism for confronting parents with the potential legal consequences of allowing their children to miss school, as well as occasionally imposing criminal penalties. In the lead-up to the remarks that resurfaced in January 2019, Harris discussed the value of education and described the impetus for her truancy crackdown as being the high prevalence of high school dropouts among homicide victims and perpetrators. As she framed it, the anti-truancy initiative was motivated by a desire to prevent, in advance, the kind of educational disengagement linked to future violent criminality and victimization: … I believe a child going without education is tantamount to a crime, so I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy. Well, this was a little controversial in San Francisco [laughs] and frankly my staff went bananas, they were very concerned because we didn’t know at the time whether I was going to have an opponent in my re-election race. But I said ‘Look, I’m done. This is a serious issue, and I’ve got a little political capital and I’m going to spend some of it.’ And this is what we did. We recognized that, in that [anti-truancy] initiative, as a prosecutor and law enforcement [official], I have a huge stick, the school district has got a carrot — let’s work in tandem around our collective objective and goal, which is to get those kids in school. So to that end…I sent a letter out on my letterhead, to every parent in the school district, outlining the connection that was statistically proven, between elementary school truancy, high school dropouts, who will become a victim of crime and who will become a perpetrator of crime. We sent it out to everyone. A friend of mine actually called me and he said “Kamala, my wife got the letter. She freaked out. She brought all the kids into the living room, held up the letter, said ‘If you don’t go to school, Kamala’s going to put you and me in jail?! '” [laughs] Yes, we achieved the intended effect. And here’s what we also did — we created what we called the D.A. Mediation Program where we assigned prosecutors to go and sit with the administrators and principals when they met with all the parents. And frankly, you know the prosecutors in my office who volunteered to do this? My homicide prosecutors, my gang prosecutors. And they went over there and I said “When you go over there, look really mean” [laughs] and so they did. And invariably the parents said “Well who’s the mean-looking dude?” and the principal would say “Well that’s someone that mean D.A. Kamala Harris sent over here ‘cos she said she’s going to start prosecuting you if we can’t work this out. And through that initiative we found cases like the case of the woman who was by herself, raising her three children, holding down two jobs, and homeless. She just needed some help. But by shining this infrared spotlight of “public safety” on the fact that her children aren’t in school, we were able to figure that out, get her access to services that exist, and through that process, the attendance of her children improved, we dismissed the charges against her and overall we’ve improved attendance for this population in San Francisco by 20 percent over the last two years. The first fact to note is that Harris, according to her account, did not prosecute the homeless woman in question to the extent of a criminal trial, conviction, and punishment, because that was not the ultimate goal of the program. The anti-truancy program worked in that case as it was intended. By confronting the mother with the negative potential outcome of criminal conviction, San Francisco authorities were able to bring her into a process that involved providing her help and resources that she would otherwise not have received, while also motivating her (albeit in a coercive manner that some observers have criticized) to ensure her children attended school, thus making it statistically less likely they would end up as the victims or perpetrators of crime. As Harris said, that outcome meant her office was able to dismiss the charges against the mother. Harris wrote about the same woman in her 2009 book Smart on Crime, many of whose anecdotes she repeated in her Commonwealth Club speech. There she specified that the provision of services, a key part of the truancy policy that many 2019 critics did not mention, included finding housing for the previously homeless woman: “The picture began to brighten. At one high school, overall attendance among the one hundred students in the [District Attorney] mediation program improved 40 percent. At another elementary school, we saw a 75 percent drop in the number of chronically absent students. Along the way, we learned some things about the situations some of these families faced and found we could help. For example, we met a mother with three children who was homeless and holding down two jobs trying to get her situation under control; we referred her to community resources to find stable housing and get her children to school.” So when Harris recounted with satisfaction the story of that homeless woman, she was in fact describing a case in which the anti-truancy program had the result of forcing the woman, on pain of prosecution, into an administrative process whereby she was provided with housing and services and given both help and coercive incentive, which resulted in her children’s attending school more. Further details on the mechanics and procedures involved in the truancy initiative can be found here, but the key point is that the purpose of the program was not to criminally prosecute or jail parents of truant children. In fact, such an outcome would mean the program had failed. Its purpose was to use the threat of prosecution to “bring parents to the table” and initiate a series of steps that (crucially) involved providing services and resources to parents and did indeed have the effect of lowering the rate of truancy in San Francisco. That is not to support or defend the program itself, or endorse the remarks made by Kamala Harris in her 2010 speech, or the tone in which they were delivered. Rather, our point here is to accurately describe what the program actually entailed, and therefore what it was Harris recounted with satisfaction before the Commonwealth Club. What Harris was celebrating or “boasting” or “bragging” about was not the prosecution or jailing of a homeless mother, but rather the fact that the successful implementation of her anti-truancy program had avoided the need to prosecute or jail that mother. And it had the effect of bringing her children back to school, an outcome that is linked to a lower statistical risk of becoming a victim or perpetrator of crime. It is therefore a significant misunderstanding (or misrepresentation) of the facts to claim, as Fox News did, that Harris was “boasting” about prosecuting parents, or to claim, as Grit Post did, that “Kamala Harris once bragged about prosecuting a homeless single mom working two jobs.” Nathan Robinson, in his column for The Guardian, conflated two separate anecdotes and falsely claimed that Harris had “cheerfully recounted” her instructions to prosecutors to “look really mean” in order to “intimidate a homeless single mother.” Harris was recalling her instructions to prosecutors when attending D.A. mediations involving dozens of parents and school administrators, not gleefully ordering them to target a specific homeless mother for intimidation. It is true, though, that the threat of prosecution and the involvement of San Francisco’s top prosecutor, District Attorney Kamala Harris, was an essential component of the anti-truancy program, even if its end goal was not the criminal prosecution of parents. So it is understandable that some observers in 2019 misunderstood or misrepresented the actual mechanics and purpose of the anti-truancy program and therefore the meaning and significance of what Harris said in her January 2010 speech at the Commonwealth Club.",mixture,"What's true: Harris did laugh and speak with satisfaction about presenting the parents of truant children in San Francisco with the threat of criminal prosecution.

12,"Mike Coffman Says state Sen. Morgan Carroll's votes made ""it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first.","Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman pulls no punches in an ad accusing his Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her ""shady interests"" as a trial lawyer. ""Meet Morgan Carroll, state senator, who’s also Morgan Carroll, personal injury lawyer,"" the narrator says in the ad that aired Sept. 20. ""Morgan Carroll the lawyer has worked for some of the sleaziest firms in the state. And they love frivolous lawsuits."" The ad shows photos of Carroll on billboards next to slimy-looking lawyers. The narrator says the state senator’s votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."" Coffman’s radio version of the ad goes further, accusing Carroll of ""using her position in the state Senate to line her own pockets"" and speaking about an ""odor of corruption,"" the Denver Post reported. We took a hard look at Coffman’s TV ad claim that Carroll's votes resulted in ""making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses""to serve her ""shady interests."" Carroll became an attorney in 2000, and spent the first decade of her career working with her mother. Their firm mostly represented clients with disabilities, Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich told PolitiFact. In an ad of her own, Carroll recalls that she was a girl when her dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and she watched him get sicker as medical costs wiped out his retirement savings. ""It's why I've dedicated my career to fighting for people with disabilities, helping people stay in their homes and receive the care they need,"" she says. More recently, Carroll worked for two big personal injury law firms whose TV commercials are well-known to Coloradans. She spent two years at the Sawaya Law Firm, then moved to Bachus & Schanker. The Bachus & Schanker website says, ""Morgan Carroll specializes in representing people in personal injury, Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability and employment law."" Godinich said Carroll primarily was doing legal research at the firm until about four months ago when she took time off to devote herself to the race against Coffman for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, a crescent-ring of Denver suburbs. The Coffman ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. One of them is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman says Carroll opposed to make it ""easier to sue""doctors and nurses. The Republican-sponsored bill granted immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics to help people in need. The Coffman ad is misleading. Carroll, who at the time was a House member, voted against the bill in committee after she and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association raised concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield a medical professional when a patient was harmed by gross negligence. However, Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to grant immunity to medical volunteers from civil liability when an ""act or omission of a volunteer"" resulted in injury, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct and even violent crimes -- acts that would prevent a volunteer from receiving immunity under the federal Volunteer Protection Act. Ultimately, Carroll supported passage of the law that made it harder -- not easier -- to sue volunteer doctors, nurses and other health-medical professionals -- unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Coffman’s claim that Carroll made it easier to sue small businesses, refers to the ""Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013. ""Carroll was a primary sponsor of the bill. State law already allowed someone who prevailed in a complaint about employment discrimination or unfair employment practices before the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to sue for back pay, future pay, or to be reinstated or hired if they were improperly fired or denied a job. Carroll’s bill allowed victims of employment discrimination who win a lawsuit to also receive compensatory and punitive damages in cases where it was proved an employer engaged in intentional discrimination. In addition, the bill allowed an employee to be awarded attorney’s fees and costs. But if a judge found a lawsuit was frivolous -- or unjustified -- the court could award attorney’s fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages at $10,000 for a business with fewer than five employees, and $25,000 for an employer with five to 14 workers, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council’s fiscal analysis. The bill and the Legislative Council noted that while federal antidiscrimination laws allow compensatory and punitive damages, those laws don’t protect workers who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or if their employer has fewer than 15 employees. Carroll’s state bill allowed people to seek the increased damages when their employer had less than 15 employees or there was discrimination based on sexual orientation. So the legislation, which became law, didn’t make it ""easier to sue"" small businesses -- people could already do that -- but it did allow people the opportunity to win greater financial damages. What about Coffman’s accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer? We checked the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission’s records and found no evidence of an ethics complaint having been made against Carroll. The Legislature’s ethics rules state that a lawmaker has a personal or financial interest in legislation ""if the passage or failure of such bill, measure, or question will result in the member deriving a direct financial or pecuniary benefit that is greater than any such benefit derived by or shared by other persons in the member's profession, occupation, industry, or region."" But a lawmaker will not be deemed to have a personal or financial interest in a bill that ""affects the entire membership of a class to which the member belongs."" In a part-time ""citizen legislature"" like Colorado’s, this generally allows a doctor/lawmaker to vote on a health care bill, a teacher to vote on an educational bill, and a builder to vote on a construction bill. Our ruling Coffman says Carroll’s votes on state legislation made ""it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first.""

13,"“The NFL agreed to give the domestic terror group, BLM, 250 million dollars.”","Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who filed the multibillion-dollar case, argued in a state court in the city of Norman that J&J should be forced to pay for helping cause the “worst manmade public health crisis in our state’s history.” His case is the first to reach trial from around 2,000 lawsuits filed by state and local governments seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for a drug epidemic the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says led to a record 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in 2017. The non-jury trial came after Oklahoma resolved claims against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP in March for $270 million and against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Sunday for $85 million, leaving only J&J as a defendant. Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for the state, told Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman that New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, along with Purdue and Teva, used misleading marketing beginning in the 1990s to push doctors to prescribe more opioids. Beckworth said J&J, which sold the painkillers Duragesic and Nucynta, marketed the opioids as “safe and effective for everyday pain” while downplaying their addictive qualities, helping create a drug oversupply. He said J&J was motivated to boost prescriptions not only because it sold opioid painkillers, but because it also grew and imported raw materials opioid manufacturers like Purdue used. “If you have an oversupply, people will die,” Beckworth said. J&J lawyer Larry Ottway countered that its products made up a small share of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma and carried U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved labels that warned of the addictive risks. “You have to examine the details because facts are stubborn things,” he said. He also argued Oklahoma was seeking to “stretch” the bounds of a public nuisance statute in order to force it to pay up to $17.5 billion to help the state address the epidemic for the next 30 years. The case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in other opioid lawsuits, particularly the 1,850 cases consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has been pushing for a settlement ahead of an October trial.

14,You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.,"Searching for a great gift for all ages? Look no further, Amy Schumer has the product for you. In a recent sketch on her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer, Schumer and fellow comedian Kyle Dunnigan play infomercial hosts pitching viewers on the perfect ""stocking stuffer"": a handgun. A hopeful buyer laments that he can’t get a gun because he has a criminal record riddled with felonies. ""Caller, you bite your tongue, you silly goose!"" Schumer’s character says. ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies, as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."" ""If you go to a gun show, you can get an unlicensed seller to sell you a gun, no questions asked,"" Dunnigan added We’ve looked at similar claims before. Because this sketch is getting a lot of attention, we wanted to recap whether a felon can actually buy a gun on the Internet or at a gun show. This isn’t the first time Schumer has tackled gun issues; she has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws since a gunman killed two and injured many others at a showing of her feature film Trainwreck in a Louisiana movie theater in 2015. But it is her first time on the Truth-O-Meter. The 'gun show loophole' To be clear: The kind of transaction Schumer’s character describes is illegal. Federal law prohibits felons from getting a gun unless their rights have been formally restored. Felons can theoretically get around this obstacle, however, by buying guns from unlicensed sellers who are not required to conduct criminal background checks. This is sometimes referred to as the ""gun show loophole,"" even though it refers to all private sales, and not everyone considers it a loophole. Schumer’s sketch was referring to this aspect of current gun law, said a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety, gun control advocacy group Schumer promotes at the end of the sketch. Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms ""with the principal motive of making a profit"" is supposed to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, a gun show, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns. If an individual buys a gun from someone who is not required to have a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet or at a gun show because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a few important limitations on these sorts of private transactions. First, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But private sellers ""can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions,"" Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, previously told PolitiFact. So in the case of Schumer’s show, she and her co-host would not have that cushion of plausible deniability because the hopeful buyer told them outright that he is a felon. The giant ""gun show"" banner doesn’t make a difference. Second, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transaction is likely to take place in person, as opposed to the buyer entering credit card information online, and the seller shipping the gun to the buyer’s house. And third, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. With all these restrictions, how many people actually buy guns without a background check? The truth is we don’t really know. The only statistics floating around are outdated and flawed. Professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 that isn’t yet published. The national survey of 4,000 non-institutionalized adults found that 22 percent of the people who purchased guns — at gun shows, stores or elsewhere — underwent no background check, Matthew Miller, professor of Health Sciences and Epidemiology at Northeastern and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us in January. When researchers excluded purchases between family and friends, that number dropped to 15 percent, which equates to approximately 5 million gun owners whose most recent purchase did not involve a background check. One more thing: Later in Schumer’s sketch, another hopeful buyer calls in to ask if he can get a gun even though he’s a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. ""You’re fine, sweet potato fry,"" Schumer’s character says. A March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined how many people applying for gun purchases went through the FBI’s instant background check system and also were on the FBI’s list of ""those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity."" Between February 2004, and December 2014, 2,233 people on the list applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed. Our ruling Schumer’s character said, ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."" The kind of transaction Schumer described is possible, though illegal, and far more complicated than her comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they could purchase a gun from private sellers over the Internet or at a gun show without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. Schumer is doing a comedy bit, but compared with similar claims we’ve checked, her phrasing makes it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful. That is not the case. The context is significant. We rate her claim .",mixture,"Schumer’s character said, ""You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show.""

15,Drinking one diet drink a day triples a person's risk of dementia and strokes.,"High-sugar beverages such as soda are uncontroversially unhealthy, and their regular consumption is causally associated with a variety of adverse health conditions, including coronary heart disease and diabetes. The recognition of this association has led to an increase in the popularity of beverages with alternative sweeteners. The health effects of artificially sweetened products are less clearly understood and remain an active area of research, which unfortunately for rational scientific discourse means the topic also makes for effective clickbait and scare claims. One example of that phenomenon comes from the website “Skinny and Healthy,” which posted an article headlined “Drinking One Diet Drink Daily Can Triple Risk of Dementia and Stroke.” Like most citation-free science clickbait, that article primarily consisted of a copy-pasted press release, in this case for a 2017 study published in the journal Stroke which has been reframed in a way to suggest that the results were more authoritative than they actually were: Remember that we are what we eat. Sugary drinks are bad, but diet drinks can even be more dangerous! Drinking One Diet Drink A Day Can Triple Risk Of Dementia And Strokes. Bad for our body and our brain too … Boston University researchers found aspartame, a low-calorie sweetener, wreaks havoc on the arteries — as opposed to sugar-sweetened drinks. This means drinking diet soda is far worse for your health than drinking regular soda sweetened with sugar. The results showed that adults who had one or more diet drinks a day were 2.9 times more likely to develop dementia and 3 times more at risk of strokes compared to those who virtually had none at all. Most important is that the study did not indicate that “diet drinks can even be more dangerous” than regular ones, or that the action of drinking a soda sweetened with artificial sweeteners causes an increased risk of stroke or dementia. That study did broadly find that “drinking at least one artificially sweetened beverage daily was associated with almost three times the risk of developing stroke or dementia compared to those who drank artificially-sweetened beverages less than once a week,” but the study was not designed to address causation and did not make any argument regarding it. “The authors caution that the long-term observational study was not designed or able to prove cause and effect, and only shows a trend among one group of people,” the press release also stated. The study authors utilized data from a well-known dataset, the “Framingham Heart Study”, which included questionnaires about food preferences with other health indicators taken from people at multiple times over the course of decades: The Framingham Heart Study comprises a series of community-based prospective cohorts originating from the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. We studied the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, which commenced in 1971 with the enrollment of 5124 volunteers. Participants have been studied across 9 examination cycles approximately every 4 years, with the latest cycle concluding in 2014. We estimated the 10-year risk of both incident stroke and dementia beginning from the 7th examination cycle (1998–2001). An editorial written to accompany the study raised the possibility of selection biases that could have driven at least some of the associations documented, however. For example, it could be that people with existing risk factors for the cardiovascular issues that lead to stroke and dementia make a switch to artificially sweetened beverages for other health reasons and carry their increased risks with them: People at increased risk of vascular events because of preexisting vascular risk factors may switch from regular to diet soft drinks in an attempt to control weight and insulin resistance. It is entirely possible that the intake of [artificially sweetened beverages] starts after the cardiovascular risk is increased and, therefore, is a marker of a high-risk profile rather than being a causal risk factor for stroke or dementia. The 2017 study in Stroke also found, as alluded in the viral reports, that people who drank more sugar-sweetened beverages did not see an increase in the risk of stroke or dementia. This also could be the result of a form of selection bias stemming from the fact that the population most at risk from their sugary beverage consumption may have already died, affecting the statistical analysis: [The finding of no increased stroke or dementia risk from sugar sweetened beverages] could be attributed to selection bias, such that particularly vulnerable participants, that is, long-term [sugar sweetened beverages] consumers with a very high cardiovascular risk died earlier. This could also explain the lower-risk profile of high [sugar-sweetened beverage] consumers compared with high [artificially-sweetened beverage] consumers, the data of which were collected in 1998 to 2001. This 2017 study is not the only one to tackle the topic of adverse health outcomes from the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages. Other studies have looked at this and similar questions and reached differing conclusions: The Nurses Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study reported that greater consumption of sugar- and artificially sweetened soft drinks was each independently associated with a higher risk of incident stroke over 28 years of follow-up for women and 22 years of follow-up for men. The Northern Manhattan Study, a population-based multiethnic cohort, reported that daily consumption of artificially sweetened soft drink was associated with a higher risk of combined vascular events but not stroke when examined as an independent outcome. A 2012 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also documented an association between low-calorie beverages and stroke but argued the results should be interpreted with caution, as no clear biological mechanism explained a link between low-calorie sweeteners and the circulatory issues that lend themselves to strokes: Our finding of an association between low-calorie soda intake and stroke risk should be interpreted with caution, because we previously did not find an association between low-calorie beverages and weight gain, diabetes, or [Coronary Artery Disease], and there is not a clear biologic mechanism between low-calorie soda consumption and incident stroke. That study, in contrast to the 2017 paper, found in increased risk of stroke for sugar-sweetened beverage drinkers as well. While the 2017 study at issue here also found an association between stroke and artificially sweetened beverages, its authors pointed to uncertainties regarding what possible mechanism might link artificially sweetened beverages to either stroke or dementia, describing possible links as “incompletely understood.” Ultimately, clinical trials and not prospective cohort studies like the ones that have been used to address this question in the past will be needed to investigate causation and tease apart any possible mechanism that might exist, a point the authors of the 2017 study in Stroke made explicitly: Clinical trials are needed to establish whether the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages is causally related to dementia or surrogate end points, such as cognitive decline or brain atrophy … Given that clinical trials involving stroke end points are large and costly, clinical trials should investigate whether artificially sweetened beverages are associated with important stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure.",unproven,"Some studies show an association between increased consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and stroke or dementia risk, but that does not mean one causes the other.","

16,Chris Christie advised U.S. President Donald Trump to attempt to provoke Joe Biden to stutter during their 2020 presidential debates.,"In October 2020, many readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of social media posts that claimed Republican and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had advised U.S. President Donald Trump to provoke his Democratic rival Joe Biden into stuttering. (Biden has spoken publicly about being a stutterer throughout his life). Those posts were shared widely after Oct. 3, when Christie, an adviser to Trump in the 2016 and 2020 elections, announced he had tested positive for COVID-19. A typical version of the post read: Chris Christie gave Trump only one piece of advice as debate coach: “People who overcome stuttering have a harder time maintaining their train of thought when interrupted. Keep interrupting him and he’ll stumble when he tries to speak. This will enforce the ‘senile’ narrative.” Another widely shared version, posted on Sept. 29 after the first presidential debate, misspelled Christie’s last name as “Christy.” A third version, posted after Christie’s COVID-19 diagnosis, claimed that: Chris Christie gave Trump debate advice: “Constantly interrupt Biden. People who struggle with stuttering can lose their train of thought when they’re interrupted. Interrupt Biden and we can make him look weak and feeble.” On Oct. 6, the Democratic Coalition, a progressive campaigning organization, also tweeted a similar version of the claim. We did not find any publicly available source for the quotations attributed to Christie in those widely shared social media posts, and they appear to be, at best, paraphrases of an alleged broader Trump campaign debate strategy. It’s unclear why they were attributed to Christie, in particular. The broader claim, that Christie had advised Trump to attempt to provoke Biden to stutter, appears to be based on earlier news reports that cited anonymous sources purportedly familiar with the president’s debate preparations. On Sept. 4, 2020, three weeks before the first debate, Politico reported that Trump’s debate advisers included Christie; campaign adviser Jason Miller; campaign manager Bill Stepien; White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows; and Trump Senior Adviser Jared Kushner. According to the website, the team was split on whether or not the president should target Biden’s stutter: There’s some tension among the president’s advisers over whether it’s wise to try to trip up Biden so he stutters, or to box him in on issues. One 2016 Trump campaign official said it’s a “calculated risk” to phrase things in such a way that might cause the former vice president to stammer in his response, acknowledging such a strategy could backfire if Trump deliberately appears to be messing with Biden’s history of stuttering — an attribute Biden has used to demonstrate his ability to overcome challenges and his empathy for children in similar situations. On Sept. 29, the Washington Post cited another anonymous source as saying that Trump had been advised and was keen to “make Biden stutter and stammer.” “No one really knows what he’s going to say,” one person with knowledge of preparations said. “But he has certainly been coached to be on offense, and he wants to make Biden stutter and stammer.” Biden has been open about his lifelong struggle to overcome his severe childhood stutter. The morning after the first presidential debate, State of New York Geneseo English professor Wes Kennison contributed to the narrative surrounding the Trump campaign’s purported “stutter strategy” with a viral Facebook post in which he wrote:",unproven,"If you know and love a stutterer and you watched the presidential debate last night, within minutes it became obvious what was going on. Abusive tone of voice, rapid fire interruptions, zigzagging change of topic, personal insult and humiliation, and family pain are all tripwires that scramble a stutterer’s ability to speak. There was nothing unplanned or spontaneous in the President’s strategy. The bastards did not prep him to attack Joe. They prepped him to attack Joe’s disability hoping that by triggering his stuttering they might deceive an audience unfamiliar with the disability into thinking that Joe was stupid, weak, uncertain, confused, or lost to dementia.","

19,"Elephants think of humans as ""cute,"" in the same manner that humans think of kittens or puppies.","In December 2017, college student Julia Hass had an idea that turned out to be enormously popular when she posted that elephants evidently have a natural affinity for and affection toward human beings: I just learned that elephants think humans are cute the way humans think puppies are cute (the same part of the brain lights up when they see us) so pack it in, nothing else this pure and good is happening today. Hass, who does volunteer work as the social media coordinator for the American Gerbil Society, later clarified that she is not a scientist and based it off of a Google search. On 26 December 2017, Hass told us via e-mail that her search came in response to a Tumblr post: Elephants brain react to humans the same way that humans brain react to puppies: She told us that she realized the tweet was gaining traction when she began getting repeated phone notifications: It was exhausting and anxiety-provoking and I had to mute everything pretty fast, so after the first thousand likes, I genuinely tuned out. Later that night I started getting alerts I was trending places, and my follows, which I thought would never break 1,000 in my wildest dreams, were breaking 1,500. Which was nuts. Then my friends started sending me screencaps from meme accounts like Men’s Humor. And when I tried to tweet other things, innocuous things, hoping everything would go back to normal once people realized I was very, very boring, I was suddenly breaking 100 likes. The tweet’s spread was fueled by entertainment and content-aggregating web sites, which uncritically reposted it and reported Haas’ remark as scientific fact. Hass told us she thinks the popularity of her tweet stems from people needing positivity during a time largely characterized by animus and conflict: I saw a lot of comments that said stuff like “at least elephants think I’m cute” or “thank you, I needed this”. I described this in an unrelated blog post as “the most pleasant going viral can be”, and I stick by that. I haven’t been harassed. No men tried to explain stuff to me in the replies, or have tried to explain stuff to me since (some kind of Christmas miracle record). No one’s hit on me in DMs, threatened me, or been weird at all. Everyone’s been quite lovely, actually. A few people have even helped me raise some money for charity, too, which is nice. It is true that humans in parts of Asia have been able to tame elephants for thousands of years; as far back as 1997, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations described the relationship between elephants and humans as “quite strange”: While most of the domestic animals now most highly attuned to man (the dog, the cat, the water buffalo, etc.) have wild forebears which are largely untameable, many wild-caught elephants quickly and easily form intimate bonds with their keepers even though their wild temperament has never been modified through selective breeding. Some elephants form such warm and affectionate bonds with man as to deceive the observer into thinking that this animal must have been made truly domestic. Many other elephants in domesticity, however, remain unremittingly wild, hostile to man and ready to kill him at every chance. Clearly, a domesticated elephant is simply a wild animal in chains — but a wild animal frequently gentle and intelligent enough to be totally trustworthy as a baby-sitter to watch over human infants. In a study published in April 2017, a team of researchers at the University of California-Davis reported variations in the types of interactions between elephants and humans at Knysna Elephant Park in West Cape, South Africa. The team recorded the ways a seven-elephant herd treated not only their handlers, but volunteers at the park and tourists. Lynette Hart, a professor at the UC Davis school of veterinary medicine and one of the report’s authors, told us:",unproven,"We found that tamed African elephants preferentially and favorably interact (and initiate these interactions) with humans with whom they have a special relationship.
