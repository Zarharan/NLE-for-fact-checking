9,9,38247,A letter by Dr. Keith Albow said President Trump is “stone cold sane” and that “there’s a genius in the Oval Office” in response to critics who have questioned the president’s mental fitness.,"Dr. Keith Albow wrote a column in February 2017 that concluded President Trump is “stone cold sane” and that, based on his business empire, Trump is a genius. Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, and in the opening months of Trump’s presidency, however, Dr. Keith Albow has not made his support for Trump — and his opposition to Hillary Clinton — a secret. It should also be noted that Albow has routinely disclosed that he’s never personally evaluated the president in an in-person examination. The commentary written by Dr. Keith Albow on President appeared at Fox News in February 2017 under the headline, “Relax, Trump is Stone Cold Sane.” After acknowledging that he has never personally examined Trump, Albow wrote: Donald Trump is stone cold sane. When a man acquires billions of dollars through complex real estate transactions, invests in many countries, goes on to phenomenal success in television and turns his name into a worldwide brand, it is very unlikely that he is mentally unstable. When the same man obviously enjoys the love and respect of his children and his wife, who seem to rely on him for support and guidance, it is extraordinarily unlikely that he is mentally unstable. When the same man walks into the political arena and deftly defeats 16 Republican opponents and then the Democratic heir-apparent to a two-term president’s administration, the odds of that man being mentally unstable become vanishingly thin. Dr. Keith Albow also pointed the stock market rally after President Trump’s inauguration as evidence that the president was sane because the market doesn’t like uncertainty and investors “can take the measure of a man pretty darn well.” Albow’s column was widely circulated via forwarded emails and in social media posts. Many times the commentary was described as a letter by Dr. Keith Albow on Trump, but it was actually an op-ed published by Fox News. Dr. Keith Albow also spoke about President Trump’s mental stability during the campaign. Albow said on Fox News, via a transcript and video posted at the left-wing media watchdog Media Matters for America website, that Trump had demonstrated great restraint when the size of his hands became a topic of discussion during a debate: “Well, sure, it’s something that every candidate probably does, probably should do. Psychology’s a very powerful tool to unearth what does get under people’s skin, if you will. But listen, with Donald Trump, kind of what you see is what you get. I have to say, when the small hands issue was raised during the debate, this supposedly got the Clinton campaign very excited. They thought, “Man, he’s off his game.” He wasn’t off his game at all. Freud would have been standing up, like applauding, standing ovation. To be able to address such an intensely personal issue and say, “Listen, there’s no problem in that department,” to me that showed an incredible degree of psychological strength. With Donald Trump, he may err, he may make errors in saying what he thinks, telling us the truth, saying things that are gritty, perhaps attacking with some unkind words, which he could scale back, but you know what, his demons are on his sleeve. There’s not a lot of psychoanalysis that hasn’t been presented already.” In addition to supporting Trump, Dr. Keith Albow also openly opposed Hillary Clinton’s candidacy during the 2016 election. In September 2016, Albow penned another column that appeared at Fox News under the headline, “Dr. Keith Ablow: Hillary Clinton — Inside the mind of a shameless liar.” In the column, Albow concludes: Hillary Clinton is the one whose psychological make up would seem to leave her vulnerable. Her penchant for lying is a problem, but the really big problem is that she seems unable to determine when her lies are registering with audiences as clearly untrue. At the core, people who lie transparently do so because they lack empathy—the ability to intuit and vicariously experience what others are thinking and feeling. Locked behind walls of narcissism or arrogance or imperiousness, consumed with the pursuit of power, they can’t tell convincing lies because they can’t truly resonate with how their words and mannerisms are being received. It’s important to note that in publicly rendering his opinion on both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton without an in-person examination, Albow defied the American Psychology Association’s so-called “Goldwater Rule,” which prohibits mental health professionals from rendering opinions on subjects without first examining them. Just as in the case of rumors that President Trump is suffering from dementia (a claim we found to unproven), any claims made by mental health professionals about politicians without first examining them should be considered their personal, not medical, opinion. Comments",true,Psychiatrist Dr. Keith Albow on President Trump's Sanity-Authorship Confirmed!,"Dr. Keith Albow wrote a column in February 2017 defending President Trump's mental stability and intelligence. Although he has never personally examined Trump, Albow argued that Trump's success in business, his strong family relationships, and his ability to defeat opponents in the political arena all suggest that he is mentally stable. Albow also pointed to the stock market rally after Trump's inauguration as evidence of his sanity. The column was widely circulated and described as a letter by Albow, but it was actually an op-ed published by Fox News.

Albow has openly supported Trump and opposed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. In another column, he criticized Clinton's psychological makeup, arguing that her penchant for lying is a result of her lack of empathy and inability to resonate with others. Albow's opinions on both Trump and Clinton were made without personally examining them, which goes against the American Psychology Association's ""Goldwater Rule"" that prohibits mental health professionals from rendering opinions without first examining their subjects.

It is important to note that Albow's opinions are his personal views and not medical assessments. Claims made by mental health professionals about politicians without examining them should be considered personal opinions rather than medical diagnoses.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The concept of medical tourism is well accepted in many countries, with at least one third of consumers in every country surveyed being open to the idea, except for Japan. Indians, Indonesians, Russians, Mexicans, and Poles were the most open to the idea of being medically mobile, with 31 percent or more people in each of those countries saying they would definitely consider traveling for medical or dental treatment. On the other hand, people in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden were least likely to be medical tourists. The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year. The cost of travel, proximity, borders, and quality of care are factors that potential medical tourists consider. In Italy and Germany, about 20 percent of adults said they would definitely consider medical tourism, possibly due to their proximity to Hungary, a popular destination for health treatments.

The researchers found that occupational exposure to acrylic and nylon fibers, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, could increase the risk of breast cancer. However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal. They analyzed data from over 1,100 women, 556 of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 75 after going through menopause. The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer. The risk was highest for exposures before the age of 36 and increased with each additional decade of exposure before this age. Women exposed to acrylic fibers had a seven-fold risk of breast cancer, while those exposed to nylon fibers had almost double the risk.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that their findings could be due to chance but also suggested that they were consistent with the theory that breast tissue is more sensitive to harmful chemicals when exposure occurs before a woman reaches her 40s.

Giannecchini expressed her satisfaction with the verdict but stated that no amount of money can compensate for the cancer fight and ongoing health problems caused by chemotherapy. Johnson & Johnson plans to appeal the verdict, stating that they are guided by the science which supports the safety of their baby powder.\n\nAround 2,000 women across the US have filed similar lawsuits over concerns about the health damage caused by extended talcum powder use.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon.

The story is even handed and this new therapy is not embraced as a magic bullet. Numbers are framed appropriately, however there is no quantiative comparison of one-year abstinence rates with existing drug and non-drug therapies. There is no discussion of any side effects of the drug. Nausea, headaches insomnia and other stomach problems were the most common in the vanenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. There is brief discussion of abstinence rates, but no mention of the design of the varenicline trials. Without describing the trials as controlled, blinded, randomized, or not, it is impossible to assess the strength of the information.The numbers were from two fairly well-designed randomized, double-blind trials (N=2000 total). Abstinence was evaluated between varenicline, bupropion (Zyban) and placebo groups at 12 weeks, then continuous abstinence for another 40 weeks. There does not seem to be evidence of disease mongering, though there is the question of whether 32 million trying to quit would need drug treatment. Prevalence rates of addicted smokers are from the Center for Disease Control. Data is presented on screen as provided by Pfizer, the funder of the two varenicline trials. Dr. Riggotti, who is cited, is not affliated with the varenicline study. She is an anti-smoking advocate and the Director of the Tobacco Research and Treatment Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. If time allowed, another outside expert opinion would be appropriate. Mentions other drug treatments such as nicotine replacement therapies with similar one-year abstinence rates. No mention of behavioral component of treatment or that varenicline was compared with bupropion, which has also had similar abstinence rates when compared against placebo in randomized controlled studies. There is acknowledgment in the story that the long-term smoking cessation might be accomplished by a number of available therapies, and varenicline is only one option. The story mentions recent FDA approval of the drug to aid in smoking cessation, however, there is no discussion of when it will be available. The drug was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation. The story does a good job of listing this as just one more measure in the arsenal of smoking cessation aids. But there is not much discussion of how this is different from nicotine itself as varenicline is described as binding to the same receptor. The critical difference (and the reason this is truly novel) is that it is a partially active drug (that is it does not create the same intensity of effect as nicotine) and that it does not bind to all the subtypes of nicotine receptors. No evidence the story relies solely on a press release. There are sources cited not affiliated with the studies or Pfizer.",mixture,"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher’s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories. That same night, the ABC and CBS network newscasts ran stories on the same topic, but their stories each ran only about 15 seconds and contained little information.)","The article discusses the FDA approval of a new anti-smoking drug called varenicline. The story mentions that the drug needs to be taken twice daily for a 12-week period, but it does not provide a cost comparison with existing treatments. The article does not embrace varenicline as a magic bullet and presents the numbers appropriately. However, it fails to provide a quantitative comparison of one-year abstinence rates with other drug and non-drug therapies.

The design of the varenicline trials is not discussed, making it difficult to assess the strength of the information. The numbers presented in the article are from two well-designed randomized, double-blind trials with a total of 2000 participants. The trials evaluated abstinence rates between varenicline, bupropion (Zyban), and placebo groups at 12 weeks, followed by continuous abstinence for another 40 weeks.

The article does not show evidence of disease mongering, but it questions whether the 32 million people trying to quit smoking would need drug treatment. The prevalence rates of addicted smokers are provided by the Center for Disease Control. The data presented in the article is provided by Pfizer, the funder of the varenicline trials. Dr. Riggotti, an anti-smoking advocate, is cited in the article but is not affiliated with the varenicline study. The article suggests that another outside expert opinion would be appropriate if time allowed.

The article briefly mentions other drug treatments with similar one-year abstinence rates, such as nicotine replacement therapies. However, it does not mention the behavioral component of treatment or that varenicline was compared with bupropion in the trials. The article acknowledges that there are multiple available therapies for long-term smoking cessation, and varenicline is just one option.

The article mentions the recent FDA approval of varenicline but does not discuss when it will be available. The drug was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to its significant improvement over existing therapies. The article does not provide much discussion on how varenicline is different from nicotine itself, although it mentions that varenicline binds to the same receptor but is a partially active drug and does not bind to all nicotine receptor subtypes.

There is no evidence that the story relies solely on a press release, as there are sources cited who are not affiliated with the studies or Pfizer.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon. And the release never cautions readers as to the many limitations of this subgroup analysis, particularly the fact that the findings in this small group might reflect factors other than the effects of the medication.

16,16,3317,O’Rourke offers blue vision for red Texas during Nelson show.,"Taking an open-air stage in Texas’ progressive-minded capital city, O’Rourke said he wanted to appeal to voters from both parties and independents but called for universal health care and gay rights, warned of the ills of climate change and switched to his fluent Spanish to denounce President Donald Trump’s calls to wall off the U.S.-Mexico border. He also decried the federal government’s war on drugs, saying it disproportionately targets minorities and the poor. “People of the future are counting on us while we can still get this right,” O’Rourke said of changing the direction of Texas, where a Democrat hasn’t won statewide office since 1994. Despite refusing donations from political action committees, O’Rourke has enjoyed monster fundraising that has outpaced Cruz. He said that’s allowed him to focus on “people and that’s how we win this election.” After Nelson took the stage, O’Rourke sang backup to the iconic hit “On the Road Again” while the crowd cheered, many wearing T-shirts or waving signs bearing the candidate’s name. A three-term congressman from El Paso, O’Rourke’s openly moving to the left contrasts to some other Democrats competing in tight, red-state Senate races around the country. Those include Phil Bredesen, a former Democratic governor of Tennessee who has openly embraced the mantra of a moderate and distanced himself from his own party as he tries to win an open seat in a state Trump won two years ago by 26 points, which was nearly three times his 9-point margin of victory in Texas. Arizona Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is also running for Senate as a centrist, despite her early career as a Green Party activist. O’Rourke has kept support of his national party at arm’s length, too, but done so in keeping with his more liberal views, not to tamp them down. He’s also previously suggested that he’s open to abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and impeaching Trump. Cruz and O’Rourke’s second debate had been set for Sunday night at the University of Houston but was postponed. During their first one last week in Dallas, both candidates largely stuck to red meat issues that excite their bases while doing little to attract moderates. O’Rourke said the Nelson event wasn’t about wooing swing voters, either. “It’s a Texas event and it doesn’t get much more Texas than Willie Nelson,” O’Rourke spokesman Chris Evans said. O’Rourke also took the stage during Nelson’s July Fourth Picnic event in Austin to play guitar for the late-night finales of “Will the Circle Be Unbroken” and “I’ll Fly Away.” But with the Nov. 6 election now looming, the stakes are higher this time. His strategy breaks from those of Texas Democrats who have tried to run as moderates only to fail miserably. When Wendy Davis used a Texas Senate filibuster defending abortion rights to briefly rocket to national notoriety and launch a gubernatorial bid in 2014, she endorsed the open carry of handguns statewide and didn’t hide her past support for the death penalty. It didn’t help, as Republican Greg Abbott beat her by 20-plus points. Paul Sadler, an underfunded former state representative whom Cruz defeated by nearly 16 points in 2012, said the idea that only conservative Democrats have any hope of flipping a state like Texas is changing when it comes to social issues including medical marijuana, which is now legal in 31 states. He said Beto “reflects the more modern, young thinking within the Democratic Party.” “I’m not sure if we really call those issues liberal as opposed to merely reflecting the people we’re supposed to represent,” Sadler said. At 85, Nelson isn’t young, of course. But he’s a longtime advocate for marijuana legalization who founded his own cannabis company for places where it is legal, not including Texas, which only allows low-THC cannabis oil that can’t get a user high to be prescribed to patients with intractable epilepsy. Some detractors have posted online comments chiding Nelson for backing a “socialist” and calling for boycotts, but Nelson has shrugged those off. “I love flack,” he said on ABC’s “The View.” We’re not happy ’til they’re not happy.” His cannabis company, Willie’s Reserve, responded to conservatives’ calls to burn Nelson records by deadpanning on Twitter: “If you’re going to burn something, burn Willie’s Reserve.” ___ Follow Will Weissert on Twitter: ___ Sign up for “Politics in Focus,” a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP’s best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections:",true,"Democratic Texas Senate candidate Beto O’Rouke rallied thousands with Willie Nelson on Saturday night, offering an openly liberal vision for the country’s largest conservative state and vowing that his campaign that has shunned outside political support can topple Republican Ted Cruz in November.","Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic candidate for Senate in Texas, held a campaign event at a Willie Nelson concert where he appealed to voters from both parties and independents.

The scope of the study is large. The funders are serious. And the journal is one of the best read in the field. So why does this news release give reporters — and the rest of the world — so little in the way of details about how and whether this study is important? No quantification of benefits. No mention of harms. No mention of costs and no comparison to alternatives. The release started with a useful explanation of the study’s design, but neglected to mention this study was an extended observation of a small subgroup of patients studied in an earlier trial. The initial trial covered 4.7 years, during which no benefit was evident; this study followed a subset of patients for another 5 years. The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon. And the release never cautions readers as to the many limitations of this subgroup analysis, particularly the fact that the findings in this small group might reflect factors other than the effects of the medication.

Due to be complete next year, the plan will set out in detail what government, business and society must do to deliver the significant emissions reductions needed from all forms of transport. It will also consider how technology can encourage changes to the way people and goods move across the country, the government said. Climate change activists, including one of the founders of Extinction Rebellion, defied a police order to end protests on Tuesday after a week of disruption in London targeting Britain’s transport ministry. Among other things, the activists oppose plans to run the HS2 rail project through ancient woodlands. The transport ministry says the rail line will slash journey times between central and northern England and the capital and be much more efficient in carbon terms than driving. The government also introduced an environment bill in parliament on Tuesday to help create legally binding targets to protect the environment and reduce pollution. The bill will also establish an office for environment protection which will hold the government to account on its progress towards the 2050 net zero emissions target. Experts say the net zero target will require sweeping changes across the energy, transport, heating and buildings sectors. Britain’s business secretary Andrea Leadsom told a parliamentary committee the government would produce a long-awaited energy white paper in the first quarter of next year. That is expected to outline the government’s ambitions for the future of the country’s energy system. “I am very ambitious about our decarbonisation ambitions and the need to set targets and milestones to enable business to get on with it with a very clear steer from government,” Leadsom said.",true,"Britain said on Tuesday it would complete a plan next year to achieve net zero emissions from all forms of transport, as climate change activists targeted the transport ministry.","Britain is set to complete a plan next year to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. This commitment makes Britain the first G7 country to adopt such a target for 2050. The plan will outline the necessary actions for the government, businesses, and society to achieve significant emissions reductions across all forms of transport. It will also explore how technology can facilitate changes in transportation methods.

Transport Secretary Grant Schapps emphasized the importance of ensuring that transport is as environmentally friendly as possible, from driving cars to taking flights. This commitment comes in the midst of protests by climate change activists, including members of Extinction Rebellion, who have been targeting Britain's transport ministry. One of their concerns is the proposed HS2 rail project, which they oppose due to its impact on ancient woodlands. However, the transport ministry argues that the rail line will reduce journey times and be more carbon-efficient than driving.

In addition to the net zero emissions target, the government introduced an environment bill in parliament to establish legally binding targets for environmental protection and pollution reduction. The bill will also create an office for environment protection to hold the government accountable for progress towards the 2050 target.

Experts highlight that achieving the net zero target will require significant changes in the energy, transport, heating, and buildings sectors. To address this, Britain's business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, announced that the government will release an energy white paper in the first quarter of next year. This paper is expected to outline the government's ambitions for the country's energy system and provide clear targets and milestones for businesses to follow.

Overall, Britain's commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector by 2050 is a significant step towards addressing climate change. The government's plan, to be completed next year, will provide detailed actions for various stakeholders and explore the role of technology in facilitating sustainable transportation.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The concept of medical tourism is well accepted in many countries, with at least one third of consumers in every country surveyed being open to the idea, except for Japan. Indians, Indonesians, Russians, Mexicans, and Poles were the most open to the idea of being medically mobile, with 31 percent or more people in each of those countries saying they would definitely consider traveling for medical or dental treatment. On the other hand, people in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden were least likely to be medical tourists. The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year. The cost of travel, proximity, borders, and quality of care are factors that potential medical tourists consider.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal. They analyzed data from over 1,100 women, 556 of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 75 after going through menopause. The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer.

Clinton introduced her plan for a variety of economic issues in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 14, 2015. As president, she said, she would go ""beyond Dodd-Frank"" -- the regulations on financial institutions that took hold in 2010, following the economic crisis of 2007-08. She said she had been calling for financial regulations since the very early stages of the crisis. ""As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up,"" she said. ""I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight."" Clinton used to be the senator from New York, the home of Wall Street. She has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and of delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of a bank break-up bill, the Glass-Steagall Act -- a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. So we questioned Hillary Clinton’s record of addressing financial regulations. Did she address derivatives, subprime mortgages and financial oversight so early in the crisis? The 2008 primary campaign While the financial crisis came to a head in summer 2008, problems with housing started to bubble up in 2007 during Clinton’s ill-fated presidential primary campaign. On the trail, Clinton addressed these nascent issues -- particularly the mortgage crisis -- as early as March of that year. Clinton, still a senator at the time, delivered a speech on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market on March 15, 2007. She said too many people were ignoring warning signs. ""The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street,"" Clinton said. ""It's a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard-working families."" She gave specific proposals for addressing subprime mortgages, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, more safeguards against predatory lending practices and policies intended to prevent foreclosures. In August that year, she delivered a similar speech about dealing with problems from subprime mortgages. There, she reiterated earlier proposals, and also suggested laws establishing national standards and registration for loan brokers, as well as regulations on lenders. ""I think the subprime market was sort of like the canary in the mine,"" she said. ""You know, it was telling us loudly and clearly, ‘There are problems here.’ "" It didn’t become law, but Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies in September 2007. The first time she mentioned derivatives was in a November 2007 speech in Iowa. (A derivative is a financial product that allows investors to hedge against price fluctuations in an underlying asset.) ""We need to start addressing the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products,"" she said. ""You can't let Wall Street send the bill to your street with the bright ideas that just don't work out. Derivatives and products like them are posing real risks to families, as Wall Street writes down tens of billions of dollars in investments. Companies are taking the loss of a billion here and a billion there simply because the securities they own are worth less than they thought."" In the same speech, she spoke again of the risky lending that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, adding that she called on then-President George W. Bush to convene a conference to find a solution. And she also pushed for more oversight of financial markets: ""So as president, I will move to establish the 21st-century oversight we need in a 21st-century global marketplace. I will call for an immediate review of these new investment products and for plans to make them more transparent."" This November speech angered some of Clinton’s Wall Street donors, according to the New York Times. At the tail-end of her campaign, in March 2008 -- still before the financial crisis hit a peak later that summer -- Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation. The plan included, in part, more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards and strengthened some consumer protections. After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made noticeably fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. But the record shows that establishing policies to address the then-nascent financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. Our ruling Clinton said she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis. The crisis hit a peak in summer 2008, though it started to gain traction in 2007. Clinton began addressing the subprime mortgage issue in her appearances in March 2007. Later that year, she took on derivatives. She also proposed specific plans for solving these problems and increasing oversight of financial institutions.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

Harry Reid’s staff said that the senator broke bones in his face and his ribs when a piece of exercise equipment broke and sent him hurtling into some cabinets on New Year’s Eve. Reid later had surgery to remove a blood clot from his eye and to repair broken orbital bones, his staff said. Conspiracy theories about Harry Reid’s injuries went into overdrive when he announced that he had decided not to seek re-election after the accident had given him down time to “ponder and think.” The theory that Harry Reid suffered the injuries in a fight with his brother, Larry, went viral after the blog site Power Line made the case for it in a series of posts. The site reported that an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor named Easton Elliott said that Larry Reid showed up at a meeting in Henderson, Nevada, on New Year’s Eve drunk and covered in blood and told the group about a fight with a family member: “Easton Elliott didn’t think much more about Larry until, several weeks later, he saw a newspaper story about Larry Reid, Harry Reid’s brother, being arrested for DUI and assaulting a highway patrolman. The story was accompanied by a photograph, and Elliott immediately recognized Larry Reid as the ‘Larry’ who had attended the AA meeting on New Year’s Eve. Putting that fact together with news stories about Harry Reid being admitted to a hospital on New Year’s Day, and with Larry’s references to the Secret Service, he concluded that the family member with whom Larry fought was Harry Reid. He also knew that Harry Reid’s home is within a short distance of the location of the AA meeting.” It’s true that Larry Reid was arrested for drunken driving and assaulting a state patrol officer in February of 2015, the Las Vegas Journal Review reports. But, outside of Easton Elliott’s first-hand account, there’s no proof that Harry and Larry Reid got into a fistfight on New Years Eve. And there’s no way to tell if Easton Elliott is a real person or not. The blog post said that the name “Easton Elliott” was made up by a Las Vegas businessman to use in his second career as an addiction recovery life coach. The only trace of Easton Elliott online is a Linkedin profile that has zero connections. And although Power Line published Easton Elliott’s account, the website didn’t endorse it, or him: “That is Easton Elliott’s account.

However, conspiracy theories emerged when Reid announced that he would not seek re-election after the accident. The theory that gained traction was that Reid actually sustained his injuries in a fight with his brother, Larry Reid.

The theory was popularized by the blog site Power Line, which presented the case for it in a series of posts. The blog cited an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor named Easton Elliott, who claimed that Larry Reid showed up at a meeting on New Year's Eve drunk and covered in blood, recounting a fight with a family member. Elliott connected this account with news stories about Harry Reid being admitted to the hospital on New Year's Day and concluded that the family member involved in the fight was Harry Reid.

However, there is no concrete evidence to support the theory that Harry and Larry Reid got into a fistfight on New Year's Eve. The only source for this claim is Easton Elliott, whose existence is questionable. The blog post mentioned that the name ""Easton Elliott"" was possibly fabricated by a Las Vegas businessman for his second career as an addiction recovery life coach.

The article also mentions that Larry Reid was indeed arrested for drunken driving and assaulting a state patrol officer in February 2015. However, this does not prove that he was involved in a fight with Harry Reid on New Year's Eve.

However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk.

And I don’t know what’s going to happen next.” […] Higgins said she rarely posts to Facebook but felt it was important to convey to those outside of Italy who can’t comprehend how bad the situation is that they need to do whatever they can to not pass on the disease. Higgins appears to be the true author of this post. Furthermore, the claims she made in the post, generally speaking, are accurate. Let’s examine a few of her assertions. While COVID-19 has been compared to the flu and has similar symptoms, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that COVID-19 was at least “10 times as lethal” as the seasonal flu. Here’s a clip of Fauci’s testimony: We transcribed the relevant portion below: For the practical understanding of the American people, the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%. The stated mortality overall of this [coronavirus], when you look at all the data including China, is about 3% […]. If you count all the cases of minimal symptomatic or asymptomatic infection, that probably brings the mortality rate down to 1%. Which means that it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. In general, yes. Italy has restricted public gatherings and travel for all 60 million of its residents. Nonessential businesses such as restaurants and bars have been closed, and the country is encouraging social distancing. Food stores and pharmacies are about the only businesses that will be allowed to stay open until restrictions are lifted. CNN reported: Italy has imposed sweeping nationwide restrictions on travel and public life, a desperate attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak that looks set to plunge the world’s eighth largest economy into a steep recession. The measures announced late Monday include travel restrictions on 60 million residents, a ban on public events, the closure of schools, movie theaters, museums and gyms, and limits on opening hours for restaurants, bars and shops. The government took action as the number of deaths caused by coronavirus reached 463 and infections topped 9,000, more than double the number reported in China as a share of the population. The restrictions are in place until at least April 3. One major concern about a viral outbreak is that there won’t be enough beds and supplies to treat sick people. Although Italy may have adequate space to treat people during a normal year, hospitals can become overwhelmed when there is a surge of patients. That is currently the case in Italy. Vox reports: The coronavirus has overwhelmed the country’s health system, particularly in the north. More than 80 percent of the hospital beds in Lombardy, the hardest-hit province, are being occupied by coronavirus patients, according to Bloomberg. Intensive care units are overloaded while elective surgeries have been canceled in the process to free up beds. Stories abound on social media about doctors struggling to meet their patients’ needs, even rationing care. Although older generations are certainly at higher risk of dying from this disease, young people are not immune to COVID-19. The CDC writes that “infections in children have been reported, including in very young children.” While many younger people may have a strong enough immune system to survive the disease, they can catch it, carry it, and spread it to more people. The Verge writes: Most people who are young or healthy and who contract the virus don’t get severely ill. But if you have the virus, even if you don’t get that sick, you might come into contact with people who are more at risk — and pass the virus to them. That’s why it’s so important to stay home if you’re not feeling well. Minimizing the number of people each sick person infects is low-tech, but it’s the best way to slow the spread of a disease like COVID-19. It’s the goal of policies like school closures and event cancellations and why people who might have been exposed to the illness are asked to isolate themselves. For reference, here is the full text of Higgins’s Facebook post: I am writing to you from Bergamo, Italy, at the heart of the coronavirus crisis. The news media in the US has not captured the severity of what is happening here. I am writing this post because each of you, today, not the government, not the school district, not the mayor, each individual citizen has the chance, today to take actions that will deter the Italian situation from becoming your own country’s reality. The only way to stop this virus is to limit contagion. And the only way to limit contagion is for millions of people to change their behavior today. If you are in Europe or the US you are weeks away from where we are today in Italy. I can hear you now. “It’s just a flu. It only affects old people with preconditions” There are 2 reasons why Coronavirus has brought Italy to it’s knees. First it is a flu is devastating when people get really sick they need weeks of ICU – and, second, because of how fast and effectively it spreads. There is 2 week incubation period and many who have it never show symptoms. When Prime Minister Conte announced last night that the entire country, 60 million people, would go on lock down, the line that struck me most was “there is no more time.” Because to be clear, this national lock down, is a hail mary. What he means is that if the numbers of contagion do not start to go down, the system, Italy, will collapse. Why? Today the ICUs in Lombardy are at capacity – more than capacity. They have begun to put ICU units in the hallways. If the numbers do not go down, the growth rate of contagion tells us that there will be thousands of people who in a matter of a week? two weeks? who will need care. What will happen when there are 100, or a 1000 people who need the hospital and only a few ICU places left? On Monday a doctor wrote in the paper that they have begun to have to decide who lives and who dies when the patients show up in the emergency room, like what is done in war. This will only get worse. There are a finite number of drs, nurses, medical staff and they are getting the virus. They have also been working non-stop, non-stop for days and days. What happens when the drs, nurses and medical staff are simply not able to care for the patients, when they are not there?",true,"And finally for those who say that this is just something that happens to old people, starting yesterday the hospitals are reporting that younger and younger patients – 40, 45, 18, are coming in for treatment.","The article discusses a Facebook post by Cristina Higgins, an American living in Italy, about the severity of the COVID-19 crisis in the country. The post gained significant attention and was shared over half a million times. Higgins confirmed that she is the true author of the post and is currently living in Italy.

The claims made by Higgins in her post are generally accurate. She emphasized that COVID-19 is more lethal than the seasonal flu, with a mortality rate of about 3% compared to 0.1% for the flu. Italy has implemented strict measures to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, closures of nonessential businesses, and social distancing. The country's healthcare system is overwhelmed, with over 80% of hospital beds in the hardest-hit province occupied by COVID-19 patients. Doctors are struggling to meet patients' needs and are even rationing care.

The article also highlights the importance of young people taking precautions, as they can catch and spread the virus to more vulnerable populations. The goal is to minimize the number of people each sick person infects through measures like school closures and event cancellations.

The full text of Higgins' Facebook post is included in the article, where she urges individuals to change their behavior to limit contagion and prevent their own countries from experiencing the same crisis as Italy.

Overall, the article confirms the authenticity of Higgins' post and verifies the accuracy of her claims about the severity of the COVID-19 crisis in Italy.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The concept of medical tourism is well accepted in many countries, with at least one third of consumers in every country surveyed being open to the idea, except for Japan.

The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

Needless to say, Reid voted against it, but with the help of 11 Democrats, the amendment passed 62-35. Interestingly, the Senate also passed a subsequent amendment (S.AMDT.4073) proposed by then Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., ""to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States, and to preserve and enhance the role of the English language."" Reid voted for that amendment, which passed by a vote of 58 to 39. The immigration reform bill did not pass that year, however, and when a second stab at comprehensive immigration reform was undertaken in 2007, Inhofe again proposed an amendment (S.AMDT.1151) ""to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States, and for other purposes."" Reid again voted against it, though the measure passed 64-33. But that immigration reform bill never came to pass either. To this day, no ""official language"" exists at the federal level. The bottom line here is that Reid twice voted against amendments to ""declare English as the national language of the Government of the United States,"" even as he voted for an amendment ""to declare that English is the common and unifying language of the United States."" The ad says Reid twice voted against declaring English our national language. Reid not only voted against the bills, he was quite vocal in his opposition. We rate the ad's claim .",true,Sharron Angle says Sen. Harry Reid twice voted against making English the national language,"The article discusses an ad by the Sharron Angle campaign that portrays Harry Reid, Reid's opponent in the Nevada Senate race, as a friend to illegal immigrants. The ad claims that Reid voted against declaring English as the national language of the United States, twice. The article fact-checks this claim and provides evidence to support it.

In 2006, during a push for comprehensive immigration reform, Senator James Inhofe proposed an amendment to declare English as the national language of the United States. The amendment aimed to require all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English and establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Reid made an impassioned speech denouncing the bill as ""racist"" and ""divisive"" and voted against it. The amendment passed with the help of 11 Democrats.

In the same year, another amendment proposed by Senator Ken Salazar to declare English as the common and unifying language of the United States was passed, and Reid voted in favor of it. However, the immigration reform bill did not pass that year.

In 2007, during another attempt at comprehensive immigration reform, Inhofe proposed another amendment to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States. Reid voted against it, and the amendment passed.

The article concludes that Reid twice voted against amendments to declare English as the national language of the United States, even though he voted for an amendment to declare English as the common and unifying language of the United States. The claim made in the ad that Reid voted against declaring English as the national language is supported by his voting record and his vocal opposition to the bills. Therefore, the claim is rated as true.

Overall, the article provides evidence to support the claim that Harry Reid voted against declaring English as the national language of the United States, twice.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The concept of medical tourism is well accepted in many countries, with at least one third of consumers in every country surveyed being open to the idea, except for Japan. Indians, Indonesians, Russians, Mexicans, and Poles were the most open to the idea of being medically mobile, with 31 percent or more people in each of those countries saying they would definitely consider traveling for medical or dental treatment. On the other hand, people in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden were least likely to be medical tourists. The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year. The cost of travel, proximity, borders, and quality of care are factors that potential medical tourists consider.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer. The risk was highest for exposures before the age of 36 and increased with each additional decade of exposure before this age. Women exposed to acrylic fibers had a seven-fold risk of breast cancer, while those exposed to nylon fibers had almost double the risk.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that their findings could be due to chance but also suggested that they were consistent with the theory that breast tissue is more sensitive to harmful chemicals when exposure occurs before a woman reaches her 40s.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon.

188,188,6223,Aid groups descend on Indonesia quake zone; deaths reach 102.,"Volunteers and nearly 1,500 rescue personnel concentrated their search on the hard-hit town of Meureudu in Pidie Jaya district near the epicenter of the magnitude 6.5 quake that hit before dawn Wednesday. But the small number of heavy excavators on the scene meant progress was slow. Humanitarian assessment teams fanned out to other areas of the district. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the death toll had risen to 102 and warned it could increase. Search teams were using devices that detect mobile phone signals within a 100-meter (yard) radius to help guide their efforts as they scoured the rubble. The disaster agency said more than 750 people were injured. “We have to move faster to search and rescue possible survivors,” said Iskander Ali, a Pidie Jaya official. Those killed included very young children and the elderly. Mohammad Jafar, 60, said his daughter, granddaughter and grandson died in the quake but he was resigned to it as “God’s will.” He was getting ready for morning prayers when the earthquake hit. He said he and his wife managed to push their way out through the debris. Another man said he found his 9-year-old daughter alive beneath a broken wall at his neighbor’s house. Thousands of people are homeless or afraid to return to their houses. Nugroho said more than 11,000 people have been displaced and are staying at shelters and mosques or with relatives. About 10,500 homes were damaged and dozens of mosques and shop houses collapsed. Killer quakes occur regularly in the region, where many live with the terrifying memory of a giant Dec. 26, 2004, earthquake that struck off Sumatra. The magnitude-9.1 quake triggered a devastating tsunami that killed more than 100,000 Acehnese. Sulaiman, a Disaster Mitigation Agency official in Aceh, said staple foods for women and babies are most urgently needed. He said medicines are sufficient because assistance is coming from the army, police, state-run companies and local governments. “What’s badly needed now are staple foods such as rice, cooking oil, salted fish and other foods,” said Sulaiman. He said people had complained about a lack of clean water, but the problem has been tackled and electricity supply is returning to normal in many areas. Nugroho, at a news conference in Jakarta, listed as urgent food and clothing, specialist doctors for victims suffering fractures, medical equipment, temporary shelters and heavy excavation equipment. The Indonesian government sent 50 tons of urgent aid to Aceh, including 10 generators, tents, folding beds, baby supplies and body bags. “Every aid and civil society organization is piling into the area with as many boxes of rice, instant noodles, blankets and other aid as they can shift,” said Paul Dillon, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, which has an assessment team in northern Aceh. It will take at least two more days before there’s a fuller picture of how many people are displaced, he said. The military is setting up an emergency field hospital and sending two dozen doctors, and the Health Ministry is sending a medical team and medicines. The Red Cross sent aid such as water trucks on Wednesday and humanitarian group CARE is leading an assessment team of four international aid groups to avoid duplication of efforts. Aid groups and others are also appealing for donations. Pope Francis, who was speaking at St. Peter’s Square for a Catholic holiday, said he wanted people to know he was praying for the victims of the earthquake, their loved ones and those left homeless. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was centered about 19 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Sigli, a town near the northern tip of Sumatra, at a depth of 17 kilometers (11 miles). It did not generate a tsunami. Aftershocks have rattled the area.

The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year.

The researchers found that occupational exposure to acrylic and nylon fibers, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, could increase the risk of breast cancer. However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal. They analyzed data from over 1,100 women, 556 of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 75 after going through menopause. The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer. The risk was highest for exposures before the age of 36 and increased with each additional decade of exposure before this age. Women exposed to acrylic fibers had a seven-fold risk of breast cancer, while those exposed to nylon fibers had almost double the risk.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that their findings could be due to chance but also suggested that they were consistent with the theory that breast tissue is more sensitive to harmful chemicals when exposure occurs before a woman reaches her 40s.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon. And the release never cautions readers as to the many limitations of this subgroup analysis, particularly the fact that the findings in this small group might reflect factors other than the effects of the medication.

But an April 18 Facebook post exaggerates seasonal flu fatalities: ""Flu killed 80k people in the U.S. last year. None of you were afraid because the media didn’t tell you to be!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post appears to rely on a number used as a preliminary estimate for the 2017-18 flu season. The final figure for that year was lower than 80,000. And while the number of people who died from flu during the 2018-19 season is still preliminary, it is estimated to be less than half of what the Facebook post claims as well. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses a mathematical model to retroactively estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. The CDC first looks at in-hospital deaths and then uses death certificate data since not all flu deaths are in the hospital. That 80,000 figure stems from a preliminary estimate provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September 2018. At that time, the CDC said early estimates indicated that ""more than 80,000 people died from flu last season"" — a reference to the 2017-18 flu season. The CDC later updated its estimate for 2017-18 to about 61,000 (though the CDC notes that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987). The estimate for flu deaths for the following year, 2018-19, is 34,157 deaths, but that number is preliminary and will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available, a CDC spokesman told PolitiFact. The Atlantic explained that seasonal flu deaths are hard to tally. ""Flu deaths are estimated through a model that looks at hospitalizations and death certificates, and accounts for the possibility that many deaths are due to flu but aren’t coded as such,"" The Atlantic wrote. ""If flu deaths were counted like COVID-19 deaths, the number would be substantially lower. This doesn’t mean we’re overestimating the flu. It does mean we are probably underestimating COVID-19."" Flu deaths are hard to tally. But we know that in September 2018, the CDC announced a preliminary estimate that flu deaths totaled 80,000. Later, the CDC updated its estimate to a lower number: 61,099 deaths. The Facebook post said ""last year"" which we think would refer to the 2018-19 season. The CDC’s preliminary estimate is about 34,157 deaths.",false,"The CDC’s estimate for seasonal flu deaths for the 2017-18 season was about 61,000. The CDC’s preliminary estimate for seasonal flu deaths for the 2018-19 season is about 34,200, but that’s not the final number.","The claim that the flu killed 80,000 people in the U.S. last year is exaggerated. The figure of 80,000 was a preliminary estimate provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the 2017-18 flu season. However, the final figure for that year was lower, estimated to be around 61,000 deaths. The CDC later updated its estimate for the 2017-18 season, noting that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987 deaths.

As for the 2018-19 flu season, the number of deaths is still preliminary and will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available. The current estimate is about 34,157 deaths, which is less than half of what the Facebook post claims.

The CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. They first look at in-hospital deaths and then use death certificate data since not all flu deaths occur in the hospital. The process of tallying flu deaths is challenging because many deaths due to flu may not be coded as such.

The Atlantic explains that if flu deaths were counted in the same way as COVID-19 deaths, the number would be substantially lower. This does not mean that the flu is being overestimated, but rather that COVID-19 deaths may be underestimated.

In conclusion, the claim that the flu killed 80,000 people in the U.S. last year is not accurate. The preliminary estimate for the 2017-18 flu season was around 80,000 deaths, but the final figure was lower at 61,000 deaths. The estimate for the 2018-19 season is about 34,157 deaths, but this number is still preliminary and subject to change.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

We reached out to Bush’s campaign, and it directed us to a tweet that Bush posted, after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized his Aug. 25 remarks.

The National Library of Medicine defines ""women’s health"" as ""the branch of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being."" While ""women’s health"" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood’s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.) In total, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, and it provided nearly 11 million services, according to its most recent annual report.

Planned Parenthood is a controversial organization that provides a range of reproductive health services, including contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services, and cancer screenings such as breast exams. While they do provide abortion services, which Bush opposes, the majority of their services are related to women’s health.

According to the National Library of Medicine, women’s health encompasses the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being. Planned Parenthood's primary focus is reproductive health, which is a significant aspect of women’s health. In 2013, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients and provided nearly 11 million services. Only 12 percent of patients received an abortion, meaning the remaining 88 percent received other health services.

Fact-checkers at the Washington Post's Fact Checker gave Bush's claim four Pinocchios, their lowest rating. They pointed out that Planned Parenthood offers a wide range of services that are directly related to women’s health, such as contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests, and STI testing and treatment. While Bush opposes abortion, it is inaccurate to claim that Planned Parenthood is not addressing women’s health issues.

In response to criticism from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Bush tweeted that Planned Parenthood's treatment of the unborn has been horrifying and suggested supporting quality women's health programs instead. However, this does not negate the fact that Planned Parenthood provides essential services for women's health.

In conclusion, Jeb Bush's claim that Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues"" is contradicted by the organization's provision of over 10 million services in 2013, including various aspects of women's health. While Bush opposes abortion, it is misleading to suggest that Planned Parenthood does not address women's health issues.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

247,247,6822,Chicago residents use kits to test for lead contamination.,"The Chicago Department of Water Management began giving residents lead-testing kits on request following concerns regarding the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and a 2013 Environmental Protection Agency study of Chicago homes. The kits contain one sample bottle for water drawn after taps weren’t used for at least six hours, a bottle used to collect water after taps were running for three minutes and a final bottle to sample water after five minutes. The results found that lead was detected in nearly 70 percent of the almost 2,800 homes tested over the past two years, according to a Chicago Tribune analysis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration limits lead concentrations in bottled water to 5 parts per billion. Tap water in 30 percent of homes had lead concentrations above the limit. Lake Michigan water is typically free of lead when it leaves the city’s treatment plants. Water becomes contaminated after passing through service lines and internal plumbing made out of lead. Chicago required using lead service lines to connect street mains and homes until Congress prohibited the practice in 1986. Individual property owners are responsible for maintaining service lines, according to the city’s plumbing code. Residents should flush household plumbing for up to five minutes when water hasn’t been used for several hours, city and EPA officials said. Tests taken since January 2016 found that about 20 percent of Chicago homes had high levels of lead even after water was running for three minutes. It is unsafe to consume lead at any level, according to the EPA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war,"" Sanders said. ""The 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury. And I would hope that in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us."" Sanders has been making this claim for more than a year, including on Twitter in 2014, in a 2014 CNN interview and at a Minnesota campaign event last summer. But is it true? Have 500,000 American veterans really returned home from recent conflicts with PTSD and brain injuries? Sanders’ claim is at the higher end of the range of estimates available. The U.S Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) have PTSD in a given year. As of late 2014, about 2.7 million troops had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. That’s a wide range: 11 percent of 2.7 million is 297,000; 20 percent is 540,000. Additionally, a U.S. Senate resolution identifies ""more than 390,000"" cases of PTSD among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn in Afghanistan, citing the secretary of Veterans Affairs as its source. Those figures only account for PTSD, not traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which Sanders also referenced. A 2013 Congressional Research Service paper on traumatic brain injury found that almost 57,000 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans were evaluated or treated for ""a condition possibly related to TBI"" by the VA. That number is slippery though. It’s not clear that all of those nearly 57,000 actually received a TBI diagnosis, and it doesn’t account for the potentially thousands more veterans who experienced a traumatic brain injury but did not receive care through the VA. The VA also estimates that brain injuries account for 22 percent of all combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department, meanwhile, identifies 333,169 instances of traumatic brain injury among service members between 2000 and 2015. That’s a big number, but there are some caveats that come with it: It includes all U.S. forces, not just those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and is overwhelmingly comprised of concussions and ""mild TBI"" that by definition lasts less than 24 hours. Also worth noting: that same U.S. Senate resolution noting 390,000 PTSD cases also references ""more than 615,000"" veterans of recent conflicts who have been diagnosed with ""at least 1 mental health disorder.""

Aviation journalist Christine Negroni reported that Alaska Airlines declined to confirm or provide any information about the incident. The San Francisco Airport had no record of the event, and the San Francisco Police Department did not mention any trafficking busts based on flight attendant tips in their archives.\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown also noted that the news reports lacked detail and follow-up. There was no information about the alleged trafficker\'s fate or the victim\'s background. Attempts to obtain verifying information about the incident were unsuccessful, as Alaska Airlines stated they could not comment and could not put anyone in touch with Fedrick.\n\nWhile the lack of public records does not necessarily mean the incident did not happen, it raises doubts about the accuracy of the story. It is possible that there was a misunderstanding or that authorities mishandled the case. The lack of detail and corroboration suggests that the outcome may not have matched the positive narrative presented in the news reports.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that an Alaska Airlines flight attendant saved a young female passenger from human trafficking in 2011 is based on a single source and lacks independent verification. Skepticism has been raised about the accuracy of the story due to the lack of corroborating information and the inability to obtain further details from the airline or authorities.\nClaim: Alaska Airlines flight attendant saved a young female passenger from human trafficking during a flight in 2011.\nThe claim veracity: unproven.\nUsing only the context provided, explain why the claim veracity is unproven.\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Either way, as she concluded, “We can’t know, because no one will provide any specifics, nor even confirm or deny that the incident occurred.”'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Context: According to a survey conducted by the National Council on Aging, medical insurer UnitedHealthcare, and USA Today, the majority of seniors aged 60 or older are optimistic about aging and expect to have the same or better quality of life in the next decade.

349,349,33801,Statistics demonstrate that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the government there instituted a gun buy-back program in 1997.,"During the 1990s, Australia was confronting a problem similar to the one that regularly confronts Americans: shooting incidents over the previous decade had left more than a hundred people dead, including the infamous Port Arthur massacre in April 1996 that saw one gunman wielding a semi-automatic rifle kill 35 people over the course of a single day (including 20 people with 29 bullets in about 90 seconds): In 1996, Martin Bryant entered a café at the site of a historic penal colony at Port Arthur, Tasmania. The 28-year-old ate lunch before pulling a semi-automatic rifle from his bag and embarking on a killing spree. By the time he was apprehended the next morning, 35 people were dead and 23 had been wounded. Bryant had become the worst mass-murderer in Australia’s history. Australia had experienced mass shootings before, but the Port Arthur massacre shook the nation to its core. Bryant was later assessed to have the IQ of an 11-year-old. He told investigators that he’d paid cash for firearms at a local gun dealer. Shortly afterwards, John Howard, the new Australian prime minister, moved to enact nationwide gun law reform (a process complicated by the fact that the Australian national government had no control over gun ownership or use, so gun reform legislation had to be passed individually by all states and territories). Those reform efforts, known as the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA), included two nationwide gun buybacks, voluntary surrenders, state gun amnesties, a ban on the importation of new automatic and semiautomatic weapons, the tightening of gun owner licensing, and the creation of uniform national standards for gun registration. Australia collected and destroyed an estimated 650,000 firearms (a reduction equivalent to the removal of about forty million guns from the United States), which reduced Australia’s firearms stock by around one-fifth. Around 2001, a piece appeared on the Internet that has been circulated widely and often ever since, attempting to make the case that Australia’s gun reform efforts were a dismal failure in terms of reducing violent crime: From: Ed Chenel, a police officer in Australia. Hi Yanks, I thought you all would like to see the real figures from Down Under. It has now been 12 months since gun owners in Australia were forced by a new law to surrender 640,381 personal firearms to be destroyed by our own government, a program costing Australia taxpayers more than $500 million dollars. The first year results are now in: Australia-wide, homicides are up 3.2 percent, Australia-wide, assaults are up 8.6 percent; Australia-wide, armed robberies are up 44 percent (yes, 44 percent!). In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent. (Note that while the law-abiding citizens turned them in, the criminals did not and criminals still possess their guns!) While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady decrease in armed robbery with firearms, this has changed drastically upward in the past 12 months, since the criminals now are guaranteed that their prey is unarmed. There has also been a dramatic increase in break-ins and assaults of the elderly. Australian politicians are at a loss to explain how public safety has decreased, after such monumental effort and expense was expended in “successfully ridding Australian society of guns.” You won’t see this data on the American evening news or hear your governor or members of the state Assembly disseminating this information. The Australian experience proves it. Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws affect only the law-abiding citizens. Take note Americans, before it’s too late! The conclusions drawn in this piece were both premature and inaccurate, however. In a peer-reviewed paper published by American Law and Economics Review in 2012, researchers Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University found that in the decade following the NFA, firearm homicides (both suicides and intentional killings) in Australia had dropped significantly: In 1997, Australia implemented a gun buyback program that reduced the stock of firearms by around one-fifth (and nearly halved the number of gun-owning households). Using differences across states, we test[ed] whether the reduction in firearms availability affected homicide and suicide rates. We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude but is less precise [somewhere between 35% and 50%]. Similarly, Dr. David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found in 2011 that the NFA had been “incredibly successful in terms of lives saved”: For Australia, the NFA seems to have been incredibly successful in terms of lives saved. While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the NFA, resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres. The NFA also seems to have reduced firearm homicide outside of mass shootings, as well as firearm suicide. In the seven years before the NFA (1989-1995), the average annual firearm suicide death rate per 100,000 was 2.6 (with a yearly range of 2.2 to 2.9); in the seven years after the buyback was fully implemented (1998-2004), the average annual firearm suicide rate was 1.1 (yearly range 0.8 to 1.4). In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33) Additional evidence strongly suggests that the buyback causally reduced firearm deaths. First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates. While there is no doubt that firearms deaths in Australia have decreased substantially in the years since the implementation of the NFA, how much of that decrease is directly attributable to the NFA is still subject to debate. Much of that debate focuses on the fact that the gun death rate in Australia was already decreasing prior to the time the NFA was introduced: For Australia, a difficulty with determining the effect of the law was that gun deaths were falling in the early 1990s. No study has explained why gun deaths were falling, or why they might be expected to continue to fall. Yet most studies generally assumed that they would have continued to drop without the NFA. Many studies still found strong evidence for a beneficial effect of the law. It’s also true that in both cases, the authors of studies cautioned that NFA-like plans wouldn’t necessarily achieve (and have not achieved) the same results in the United States, in large part because Australia’s geography makes it much easier to control the flow of arms into the country: Several factors are important in assessing the extent to which the results from the Australian buyback can be extrapolated to other countries. Australian borders are more easily controlled than in countries that have land borders. In addition, Australia’s government in general and its policing and customs services in particular are highly organized and effective. The NFA also had an extremely high degree of political support and was quite competently executed. And the buyback was accompanied by a uniform national system for licensing and registration of firearms. These factors should be borne in mind in considering the extent to which the results from the Australian NFA might generalize to other countries. It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States. Levitt provides three reasons why gun buybacks in the United States have apparently been ineffective: (a) the buybacks are relatively small in scale (b) guns are surrendered voluntarily, and so are not like the ones used in crime; and (c) replacement guns are easy to obtain. These factors did not apply to the Australian buyback, which was large, compulsory, and the guns on this island nation could not easily be replaced. For example, compared to the buyback of 650,000 firearms, annual imports after the law averaged only 30,000 per year, with many of these bought by law enforcement agencies. Regardless of how much of a cause-and-effect relationship there might be between the NFA and gun deaths in Australia, it’s undeniable that the firearms homicide rate in that country has decreased substantially since the implementation of the NFA. It’s not the case, however, as suggested by the misleading and long out-of-date online piece quoted in the Example block above (which was written way back in 2001) that the overall crime rate in Australia has shot up since the NFA was introduced. The rates of various types of violent crimes (sexual assault, kidnapping, homicides of all types) have scarcely changed at all, and while the robbery rate rose substantially in the 1998-2001 timeframe, it dropped below its pre-NFA level by 2004 and has continually declined since then:",false,Do statistics demonstrate that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the government instituted a gun buy-back program in 1997?,"The claim that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the implementation of a gun buy-back program in 1997 is not supported by statistics. In fact, the firearms homicide rate in Australia has decreased significantly since the introduction of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) in 1996. The NFA included measures such as gun buybacks, voluntary surrenders, and stricter gun owner licensing.

A peer-reviewed study published in 2012 found that firearm homicides and suicides dropped significantly in the decade following the NFA. Another study from the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in 2011 concluded that the NFA had been successful in reducing gun massacres, firearm homicides, and firearm suicides.

While it is true that gun deaths were already declining in Australia prior to the implementation of the NFA, many studies still found strong evidence for the beneficial effect of the law. However, it is important to note that the Australian experience may not be fully replicable in the United States due to factors such as Australia's controlled borders and highly organized government and law enforcement services.

The article also mentions a misleading and outdated online piece from 2001 that claimed crime rates had increased in Australia since the NFA was introduced. However, this claim is not supported by current data. The rates of various types of violent crimes in Australia, such as sexual assault, kidnapping, and homicides of all types, have remained relatively stable. The robbery rate did increase in the 1998-2001 timeframe but has since dropped below its pre-NFA level.

In conclusion, the claim that crime rates in Australia have increased substantially since the gun buy-back program in 1997 is not accurate. The implementation of the NFA has led to a significant decrease in firearm homicides and suicides in Australia.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

374,374,10093,Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test,"The release doesn’t address cost at all. The release makes clear that the blood test is not ready for clinical use, stating that researchers “hope it will be commercially available within the next five years.” However, if the release is going to discuss what such a diagnostic tool would look like (e.g., “mobile devices that could diagnose concussions on the spot”), it should also provide a ballpark figure on what such a diagnostic tool might cost. The release tells readers that the study correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries 94 percent of the time, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood corresponded to the severity of the injuries. However, the release emphasizes only one side of the biomarker story, focusing entirely on the positive predictive value. While important, we think that the other side of the coin should have been addressed as well. Another presumed benefit of an easy-to-use biomarker blood test to detect concussion would be eliminating the necessity of a CT scan if, in fact, the biomarker had a high negative predictive value. The study notes a 98% negative predictive value. That means if the test comes back negative, there is a very low likelihood that the person has suffered a concussion. This could eliminate the need for a CT scan and any additional treatments. In reality, it is unlikely that a positive test would obviate the need for a CT scan. In fact, one could argue that the presence of a positive result would require a CT scan. The 94% accuracy notation in the press release is incorrect. It should have noted a 94% sensitivity (true positive) and a 47% specificity (true negative). The low specificity means that many positive results will be wrong (see more below under “Harms”). The release is silent on the potential harms that could result from an easy-to-use biomarker test, especially one that has a 47% specificity (the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the condition). A test with only 47% specificity means that more than half of positive results will be “false positives.” The release does not address these “false positives” at all — meaning instances in which the test diagnosed a patient as having brain injury when there was no injury. A false positive could result in additional testing, which may create a financial burden, and — in the case of a CT scan — poses health risks of its own. Second, the release refers to the possibility of using the blood test to make brain injury diagnoses “on the spot.” Quoting one of the researchers who did the study, the release says: “The idea is to get a point-of-care test that could be used on the field to help the coaches, the trainers and the athletic directors, make a decision then and there about whether the child should go back to play.” However, the journal article the release is reporting on notes that GFAP is detectable in the bloodstream “within one hour of injury.” The release does note that such a tool should only be used to “help” adults make decisions about a child’s health, but this still raises some significant questions. What if a coach, for example, takes a blood test before the GFAP has had time to become detectable in the blood stream? Would that give the coach a false sense of confidence that the child is fine and can re-enter the game? The release does not provide many important aspects of the study, The release says that researchers performed CT scans on 152 children and compared the results of those scans with results from the blood test. In fact, the study was of 257 children, of which 197 had blunt head trauma and 60 were trauma controls. Of the 152 children who received CT scans, 18 were found to have traumatic intracranial lesions. That means that 1-out-of 11 of the children scanned has evidence of a concussion. So the results in the story are really only based on 18 children out of the 152 with presumed traumatic head injury. The study authors note in the paper that “a much larger number of children will be required to test the precision of the biomarker.” No disease mongering here. The release notes that the journal article’s lead author receives funding from NIH. The study itself was partially funded by the NIH, a subtle but potentially important distinction. Further, the journal article notes that the lead author is a scientific consultant for Banyan Biomarkers, Inc. — a company that has intellectual property rights to GFAP testing. The journal article also states that the relevant author “receives no stocks or royalties from the company and will not benefit financially from this publication” — but that potential conflict of interest is still worth mentioning in the release. The story provides information on the routine use of CT scanning as the standard for traumatic head injury. Since there are a host of biomarkers under study at the present time to detect concussion, we would have liked to have seen a couple of words on the other research taking place. For example, Banyan Biomarkers has one additional biomarker under study at the present time. The release makes clear that the GFAP test is not available for clinical use, and that the researchers hope to develop a test for clinical applications within the next five years. There is a robust body of literature on GFAP and brain injury, but the release does not mention that research at all. The journal article notes that “To the best of our knowledge this is among the largest published studies to date assessing GFAP in children and youth with mild and moderate [traumatic brain injury] in an [emergency department] setting.” That’s useful context, and the release should have included it. Even better, it could have told readers how this research fits into that existing body of work — is it consistent with previous findings? Does it expand on previous findings? That would be great to know. The release calls the test “simple” in several places whereas our review shows that it would be anything but. Some other examples of hyperbole: “Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test,” “Blood test is 94 percent reliable in detecting concussions in kids, confirmed by CT scans.” The story backs off in the last line that states “Researchers plan to do more studies with the blood test, but they hope it will be commercially available within the next 5 years.” That’s not quite good enough, however. In the published results, the authors stated more appropriately, “Further study is required to validate these findings before clinical application.”",false,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.","The article discusses a press release about a study that claims concussions in children can be detected by a blood test.

However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

Not applicable. The story was about a potentially harmful association, not about benefits of any intervention. Not applicable. The story was based on an observational study and the story was appropriately cautious about any causal link. We love the analysis provided by independent experts: “This is good stuff. It’s a well-done study, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that it’s not specifically a study of stroke risk. You’re looking at a community and seeing how it’s behaving on the whole,” says Daniel Labovitz, a stroke neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. “This study can’t tell you causation. It can’t tell you there’s a direct link between one thing and another, it just tells you they’re associated,” says stroke neurologist Victor Urrutia, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. How might eating fried fish impact stroke? It could be that frying the fish leaches out the omega-3s, says Jeremy Lanford, stroke director at Scott & White Healthcare in Roundrock, Texas. Or the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke, says author Nahab. He also notes that fish used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be the types lower in healthy fats. More research is needed to tease out whether cooking methods affect stroke risk, Labovitz says. “In other words, is fried fish a problem, or is it another red herring?” he says. No disease mongering of stroke, and especially not about the concern in the “stroke belt.” The independent experts quoted made the story complete. Terrific analysis of the evidence by the independent experts.

The story explained that this study is “part of a large government-funded study, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS).” It’s clear that the story didn’t rely on a news release.",true,"This story could have been botched so easily. Instead, this story covered the study and sought multiple independent perspectives which provided important analysis of the possible limitations of the research and the questions remaining. Association does not equal causation, and this story nailed that point, explaining it clearly for readers. Nice job. To others who still don’t understand the difference, see our primer on this topic.","A study conducted as part of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project has found a potential association between high fried fish consumption and increased stroke deaths. The study analyzed data from over 21,000 participants across the United States and found that in the ""stroke belt"" region, where stroke rates are already higher, the risk of stroke death was further increased in areas with high fried fish consumption. The study did not discuss the cost of fried fish.

The article emphasizes that the study was observational and cannot establish a causal link between fried fish consumption and stroke risk. Independent experts quoted in the article caution that the study only shows an association and cannot prove causation. They suggest that more research is needed to determine if cooking methods affect stroke risk.

The article also mentions possible reasons for the association between fried fish and stroke risk. One theory is that frying the fish may leach out the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. Another possibility is that the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke risk. The types of fish commonly used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be lower in healthy fats.

The article includes quotes from stroke neurologists who praise the study but emphasize the need for caution in interpreting the results. They highlight that the study cannot establish a direct link between fried fish consumption and stroke risk.

The article does not engage in disease mongering or exaggerate the concern about stroke in the ""stroke belt"" region. It also mentions a helpful sidebar that provides information about alternative sources of omega-3 fatty acids.

Overall, the article provides a summary of the study's findings and includes analysis from independent experts. It acknowledges the limitations of the study and the need for further research to determine the impact of cooking methods on stroke risk.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The scope of the study is large. The funders are serious. And the journal is one of the best read in the field.

The release started with a useful explanation of the study’s design, but neglected to mention this study was an extended observation of a small subgroup of patients studied in an earlier trial. The initial trial covered 4.7 years, during which no benefit was evident; this study followed a subset of patients for another 5 years. The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon. And the release never cautions readers as to the many limitations of this subgroup analysis, particularly the fact that the findings in this small group might reflect factors other than the effects of the medication.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

474,474,27427,United States health care facilities face an intravenous bag shortage because of the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria in September 2017.,"On 28 December 2017, a tweet from a man in California focused attention on one of less-reported aftereffects of the damage caused by the massive Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico on 20 September 2017. Ben Boyer’s post criticized the Trump administration’s response to the disaster while describing a recent hospital visit: My wife’s nurse had to stand for 30 mins & administer a drug slowly through a syringe because there are almost no IV bags in the continental U.S. anymore. See, they were all manufactured in a Puerto Rican factory which still isn’t fixed. Meanwhile that stupid swollen prick golfs. This is true. Hospitals in both Puerto Rico and the mainland United States have reported shortages of intravenous fluids and bags since Maria tore through the island — where several medical manufacturing plants are located — in September 2017. According to a Food and Drug Administration analysis released in November 2017, medical manufacturing is a significant part of the island’s economy: Prior to the devastation brought by Hurricane Maria, the medical product manufacturing sector provided, on average, approximately $800 million in local wages over a 12-month period, according to our analysis. This manufacturing industry is a key part of the island’s manufacturing base and is supported by a highly skilled workforce. Among the manufacturers affected was Baxter International, the largest IV bag supplier in the United States; the company says on its website that it ships more than a million units of IV solutions a day. The FDA responded by saying that Baxter and other companies to get priority access to the island territory’s electrical grid. On 28 December 2017, the FDA sent us the following statement: The FDA has been working very closely with industry and local and federal officials to help address the shortage situation for IV saline and other products as a result of Hurricane Maria. This remains a key area of focus for the agency and we expect that the shortage of IV fluids will improve in early 2018 based on the information we are receiving from the manufacturers. In the meantime, we are continuing all of our efforts to increase supplies while concerns remain. Baxter sent us a statement confirming that all of its facilities in the territory are connected to the local electrical grid, with backup diesel generators on tap in case of power outages. The company said it expects to “return to more normal supply levels for products made in Puerto Rico in the coming weeks.” The company did clarify, however, that its Puerto Rican operations did not include manufacture of saline IV solutions, and that production of those products continues to run normally. Baxter added: We are also bringing additional units to the U.S. market through a recent permanent approval from the FDA for IVs produced in one of our North American manufacturing plants. We expect to see this incremental supply benefitting current customers and providing us the opportunity to service other customers in the beginning of 2018. The FDA said in a follow-up statement released on 5 January 2018: FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said a key area of focus is addressing the I.V. saline shortage, which has affected patients, health care providers, and hospitals. He noted that, based on information from the companies, the shortage of I.V. saline fluids is expected to improve early this year. The number of deaths caused by the hurricane remains unclear. Although Puerto Rican authorities initially reported that around 50 people had been killed in the territory as a result of Maria, several accounts have surfaced contradicting that estimate. In early December 2017, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló ordered a recount of the death toll. He said in a statement: We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody. Boyer told us via email that his wife was receiving the treatment as part of her ongoing care for brain cancer; she was first diagnosed in 2009, and her tumor (which is inoperable) became aggressive again in 2015. At the time of his post, he said, he was unaware of the ongoing IV bag shortage: Obviously I knew about the hurricane; I lived in San Juan as a little kid and have been back to Puerto Rico many times. Both my parents worked their whole careers in health care and I knew that was part of the island but didn’t know about the current situation until our excellent nurse told me. At the time he was giving my wife her pre-meds before her chemo infusion – steroids, stomach aids, saline flush, etc. He said of the attention his tweet received: Twitter is very weird in that it’s very hard to tell how something blew up – I know it only had a couple of likes and comments for the first 5 or 6 hours and then clearly some big account RTd it – I wish I knew who it was! After that I started to see lots more RTs including several big names I recognized. As you can see from my account, I mostly tweet dumb jokes, but this was just such a wild thing and I hadn’t heard it from anyone else so I thought it would be informative. Very soon after it started to spread I started seeing lots of nurses and medical professionals jumping on it and I realized that (a) it was a story most people didn’t know about, and (b) it was clearly massively widespread and growing.",true,"Most of the people who have contacted him since his remark began spreading online, he said, have offered similar stories.","The article discusses the shortage of intravenous (IV) bags in both Puerto Rico and the mainland United States as a result of the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The tweet from Ben Boyer criticizing the Trump administration's response to the disaster brought attention to this issue. The shortage of IV bags is due to the fact that many medical manufacturing plants, including Baxter International, the largest IV bag supplier in the US, are located in Puerto Rico and were affected by the hurricane.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been working closely with industry and officials to address the shortage of IV saline and other products. The FDA expects the shortage of IV fluids to improve in early 2018 based on information from the manufacturers. Baxter International confirmed that its facilities in Puerto Rico are connected to the local electrical grid and expects to return to normal supply levels for products made in Puerto Rico in the coming weeks. However, Baxter clarified that its Puerto Rican operations did not include the manufacture of saline IV solutions, and production of those products continues to run normally.

The FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, stated that addressing the IV saline shortage is a key area of focus and expects the situation to improve early this year. The article also mentions that the number of deaths caused by Hurricane Maria remains unclear, with conflicting reports and a recount of the death toll ordered by the Governor of Puerto Rico.

The shortage of IV bags has affected healthcare facilities in the United States, leading to challenges in administering necessary treatments. Boyer's tweet brought attention to this issue, and the story gained traction on social media, with many nurses and medical professionals sharing their experiences with the shortage.

In summary, the article highlights the shortage of IV bags in the United States due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. The FDA and manufacturers are working to address the shortage, and improvements are expected in early 2018.

She tried to engage them in conversation, but the man became defensive. Fedrick discreetly left a note in one of the bathrooms, asking the girl if she needed help.

The San Francisco Airport had no record of the event, and the San Francisco Police Department did not mention any trafficking busts based on flight attendant tips in their archives.\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown also noted that the news reports lacked detail and follow-up.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

487,487,1851,Want to quit smoking ? Try acupuncture or hypnosis.,"A man holds a cigarette in Tokyo August 3, 2009. REUTERS/Stringer Researchers, whose findings appeared in the American Journal of Medicine, said that there are still plenty of questions, including exactly how effective alternative therapies might be and how they measure up against conventional methods to quit smoking. But the alternatives should still stand as options for smokers determined to break the habit, said researchers led by Mehdi Tahiri of McGill University in Montreal, Canada. In general, smokers who want to quit should first try the standard approaches, which include nicotine-replacement therapy, medications and behavioral counseling, Tahiri said. “But some people are not interested in medication,” he said, adding that in many cases the standard therapies had not worked. “Then I think we should definitely recommend (acupuncture and hypnosis) as choices.” Researchers found that some studies showed that smokers subjected to acupuncture were more than three times as likely to be tobacco-free six months to a year later. Similarly, across four trials of hypnosis, smokers had a higher success rate with the therapy compared to people who had minimal help. But there were some caveats, researchers said. The success rate was not consistent in all the tests conducted, although the broad trends pointed to the benefits of alternate treatment. A 2008 study that ran a few sessions of laser acupuncture on 258 smokers found that 55 percent who’d received the treatment quit the habit in six months, compared with four percent who were not given the treatment. But a 2007 study from Taiwan that looked at needle acupuncture around the ear, the area typically targeted for smoking cessation, reported a lower success rate. Only nine percent of those who were given acupuncture had quit after six months compared with six percent who stopped smoking without the treatment. The situation was similar across the hypnosis trials. Two studies showed a significant impact : 20 to 45 percent of hypnosis patients were smoke-free six months to a year later. The other two trials showed smaller effects. Nonetheless, Tahiri said, there was a “trend” toward a benefit across all of the studies of acupuncture and hypnosis. There are still definitely questions, he added, about how many sessions of acupuncture or hypnosis might be necessary, or which specific techniques are best. Other research reviews, though, have concluded that the jury is still out on alternative therapies for quitting smoking.

However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

The problem wasn't lack of revenue. The problem still remains today too much federal spending, and this administration's not addressing that."" We thought it would be worth checking two of Gillespie's claims. • Did Bush preside over 52 months of uninterrupted job creation? Close, but not quite. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. The economy lost jobs over two months during that stretch -- between June 2007 and July 2007 (20,000 jobs) and between July 2007 and August 2007 (71,000). That falls slightly short of being ""uninterrupted."" Gillespie would have been correct if he'd said that jobs grew for 46 consecutive months. We might add that over the course of Bush's presidency -- a total of 96 months -- the economy created 1.08 million jobs. That may sound like a lot, but compared to every other post-World War II president prior to Obama, it's the lowest average annual percentage increase in jobs created. (See our calculations here.) That said, Obama's figures are worse than any of his postwar predecessors'. The economy has shed between 2.4 million and 3.1 million jobs during the 18 months he's been in office, depending on whether you start counting with the January 2009 figures or the February 2009 figures. • Were revenues at an all-time high in 2007? Strictly speaking, yes. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, total federal tax receipts hit $2.57 trillion in 2007, before declining in 2008 and 2009, when the current recession was under way. (Tax revenues almost always sink during a recession.) The 2007 level was the highest recorded since 1934, when statistics were first collected. So on that score, Gillespie's right. But using this particular statistic neglects a key factor -- the size of the economy as a whole. Though recessions and expansions produce volatility in tax collections, as do changes in tax policy, one would expect that a bigger economy would generally produce greater tax revenues than a smaller one. And indeed, in the 57 tax years between 1951 and 2007, tax collections grew 49 times on a year-to-year basis -- a consistent trend despite frequent changes in tax rates and periodic recessions. You can easily factor out the size of the U.S. economy if you divide revenue by gross domestic product, or GDP. The Tax Policy Center has also calculated these numbers. In 2007, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP. That's high by historical standards but hardly a record. It only ties for 16th place going back to 1934, and within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009 it only rises to 7th place. So if Gillespie's point is that Bush's tax cuts led to record revenues, they did -- for 2007 at least -- but that was a record aided by a the largest, non-recession economy in American history. Ultimately, Gillespie two comments are generally accurate, but they would have benefited from some additional historical context. We realize that this is not always possible during a fast-paced television show, so on balance.",true,"Gillespie touts Bush record on taxes, job creation","The article examines two claims made by Republican strategist Ed Gillespie regarding the economic performance under President George W. Bush. Gillespie claimed that there were 52 months of uninterrupted job creation and that revenues were at an all-time high in 2007. 

Regarding the claim of uninterrupted job creation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. However, there were two months during that period where jobs were lost. Therefore, Gillespie's claim of uninterrupted job creation is slightly inaccurate. It should be noted that over the course of Bush's presidency, the economy created 1.08 million jobs, which is the lowest average annual percentage increase compared to other post-World War II presidents prior to Obama.

Regarding the claim of all-time high revenues in 2007, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center confirms that total federal tax receipts reached $2.57 trillion in 2007, the highest recorded since 1934. However, this statistic neglects the size of the economy as a whole. When considering the size of the economy, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP in 2007, which is high but not a record. It only ranks 16th place since 1934 and 7th place within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009.

In conclusion, Gillespie's claims are generally accurate but lack some historical context. While there were not 52 months of uninterrupted job creation under Bush, there were 50 months. Additionally, while revenues were at an all-time high in 2007, this was aided by the size of the non-recession economy.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

People wanting to embark on a semi-fasting program could do so without purchasing any products. The benefits are given very sketchy treatment. For example, the release says, “Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food.” The release never tells us how many mice were in the study nor how much less they weighed than the control group at the end of the trial. The release also provides what it calls molecular detail about benefits to the experimental fasting mice vs. the control mice. But again, the quantities and context are not there. “Through an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body’s reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.” What are the changes? How were they measured? We don’t see any numbers in this description to help the reader evaluate the credibility of the data. The release does not mention any potential harms that could exist for intermittent fasting. While the published study discussed the study limitations and the “practicality” of doing similar experiments with humans, the news release doesn’t acknowledge any limitations or explain to readers that animal studies are rarely replicated in humans and that much more study was called for by the authors to examine if “(1) beneficial effects of IF last after stopping the fasting (i.e., if there is a rebound effect); (2) whether there is any potential harm of IF; and (3) whether IF benefits apply to all generations (i.e., an age-dependent issue) and disease conditions.” There was no disease mongering. The research was funded by a variety of grants which were listed in the sidebar of the EurekAlert! site, but not in the news release text. The authors declared in the journal article that they had no conflicts of interest. While the release is written as if it could help inform human obesity treatment or prevention, there is no discussion of how obesity is treated or prevented now and the many alternatives available. These include changes in exercise and diet patterns and bariatric surgery. Fasting is widely available. The release does not make a claim of novelty. In the journal article, the authors write that others have established the ability of intermittent fasting to promote weight loss. They do say that they have identified a mechanism that might explain why weight loss occurs in fasting mice which could be considered novel. We think the headline is stretching things by stating “On and off fasting helps fight obesity.” The average reader likely assumes the obesity referred to is in humans and not mice. The release doesn’t clarify that the study was only in mice until the fourth sentence. “Up to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting without otherwise having to count calories helps fight obesity and other metabolic disorders. Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature.

The release was short on numbers and descriptions of measurements used, and implied that the mouse studies could benefit people, without any caveats that such a transfer of mouse discovery to practical application in humans often fails. The release did name the funders and avoided sensationalizing obesity. Obesity is an enormous public health problem. But this release misleads the reader into thinking its conclusions will transfer from the mice in the study to human patients with obesity. We were disappointed by this quote from one of the researchers: “Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,” says Kyoung-Han Kim.” Based on the published study, we don’t find any evidence that this has been proven for human patients.

It also points out that the release lacks specific details about the benefits of intermittent fasting, such as the amount of weight loss achieved by the fasting group compared to the control group.

The release mentions that intermittent fasting has an impact on the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation, but it does not provide specific measurements or context for these changes. It also fails to mention any potential harms associated with intermittent fasting.

The article highlights that the release does not acknowledge the limitations of the study or the fact that animal studies are rarely replicated in humans. The authors of the study called for further research to examine the long-term effects of intermittent fasting, potential harms, and whether the benefits apply to all generations and disease conditions.

The release does not discuss current methods of obesity treatment or prevention, nor does it claim novelty in the field of intermittent fasting. The authors of the study acknowledge that others have already established the ability of intermittent fasting to promote weight loss, but they have identified a mechanism that explains why weight loss occurs in fasting mice.

The article concludes by criticizing the headline of the release, which states ""On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity,"" as it may mislead readers into thinking the study was conducted on humans rather than mice. The release only clarifies this in the fourth sentence.

Overall, the article highlights the lack of important information and context provided in the release, as well as the need for further research to fully understand the effects and potential harms of intermittent fasting.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

One case reported to the FDA was of a U.S. patient who in July suffered a serious hemothorax, or blood buildup between the chest wall and lungs. The patient had to stay in the hospital for 16 days, and doctors said an artery ""most likely"" was punctured during the operation. AngioDynamics said in the FDA report that such a puncture is a ""possible complication"" of any such operation."" This is more detail than is provided in most stories, even when there is much more evidence available. The entire reason for this story is to evaluate the disconnect between the claims being made for these machines and the lack of evidence to support those claims. It does a great job walking readers through the way the machine is supposed to work, the health benefit claims and the paucity of credible evidence for the machine’s benefits. One quibble: AngioDynamics says that the machine has been tested in ""small number of human patients"". What were the results? Why does the company think the results are promising? This story does not engage in disease-mongering. The story quotes a number of outside experts, including Riad Salem, chief of interventional oncology at Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital; Ken Thomson, a radiologist in Australia who studied the devices; and Tim Clark, director of interventional radiology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia. Importantly, the story also makes the distinction between the claims the company is making and the claims being made by the clinics and hospitals who have bought the machines (and are trying to recoup their investments.) It quotes the CEO of the machine manufacturer saying, ""We are not part of the whole PR machine. It’s not something we are happy about."" The story does not do a very good job of contrasting this treatment with other treatments. This is disappointing because one of the claims made by the manufacturer’s CEO is: ""We think this is a very promising technology for treating cancer that is otherwise untreatable."" Some specifics about those cancers and how they are otherwise treated would have been nice. Because the NanoKnife has not been compared to a more traditional surgical approach, the benefits of the new technology are hard to define.

The promotion and use of these under-researched devices can have devastating consquences for patients. In addition, one of the major drivers of increasing health care costs is the introduction of new technologies. While additional costs may be justified if there is an improvement in patient outcomes associated with the new technology, newer is not always better. The NanoKnife is the latest in a series of new devices, approved by the FDA, that have yet to demonstrate a substantive improvement in patient outcomes. Hospital promotion of new technologies is now rivaling that of other commercial interests with unsubstantiated claims.","The article discusses a new cancer treatment called the NanoKnife and raises questions about its effectiveness and lack of scientific evidence. The machine costs around $300,000, but Medicare does not specifically cover its use. Some private insurers, like Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield, also decline to cover it due to the lack of scientific evidence of its effectiveness in improving health outcomes.

The article mentions that the NanoKnife has some reported side effects, such as triggering fast heartbeats and the possibility of puncturing an artery during the operation. However, the company behind the NanoKnife claims that these side effects have been treatable and that they have taken steps to minimize future occurrences.

The story highlights the lack of evidence for the benefits of the NanoKnife due to the limited number of human patients it has been tested on. It questions why the company thinks the results are promising and does not provide a comparison with other traditional surgical approaches for treating cancer.

The article quotes several outside experts, including Riad Salem, chief of interventional oncology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Ken Thomson, a radiologist in Australia who studied the devices, and Tim Clark, director of interventional radiology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. These experts provide their opinions on the NanoKnife and its claims.

The story also distinguishes between the claims made by the company and the claims made by the clinics and hospitals that have purchased the machines. The CEO of the machine manufacturer states that they are not part of the PR machine and are not happy about it.

The NanoKnife is currently being used in about 13 U.S. hospitals and has been used to treat around 300 cancer patients worldwide. The article mentions that similar devices have been used for other procedures, but the NanoKnife is a relatively new therapy for cancer.

Overall, the article raises concerns about the lack of evidence for the NanoKnife's effectiveness and the limited coverage by Medicare and private insurers.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer. The risk was highest for exposures before the age of 36 and increased with each additional decade of exposure before this age. Women exposed to acrylic fibers had a seven-fold risk of breast cancer, while those exposed to nylon fibers had almost double the risk.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that their findings could be due to chance but also suggested that they were consistent with the theory that breast tissue is more sensitive to harmful chemicals when exposure occurs before a woman reaches her 40s.

558,558,9712,Penn study: Pay patients to take their pills,"The story discusses costs in a very interesting way – because the point of the research was modifying human behavior by paying “rewards” of cash to patients and sometimes doctors. What we didn’t find in the story is the “cost” of manpower to run a program like this. How much would it cost (besides the actual cost of $1,204 per patient-doctor pair) to administer this? How practical is it? We applaud the writer for including this paragraph – giving the real context that matters most. Italics added by editor. “Still to come is an analysis of whether the amounts paid in the study – up to $1,024 over the course of a year – would be worth it, in terms of avoiding the costs of treating a certain number of heart attacks and strokes.” Overall, the story does an excellent job of addressing the cost trade-offs. There were four patient groups. The story does a great job of describing the precise benefits, in terms of blood cholesterol, that each patient group showed (if any). The group that benefited the most was the one where both patients and doctors received incentives. That group showed a drop of 33.6 points in LDL cholesterol, compared to a 25.1 drop in the group that received no money. It may have been useful to include a sense of how that reduction might translate into reduced risk of a heart attack (one could use the risk calculator the story mentions to calculate an estimate, or ask one of the sources to help with this). But while quantifying the drops in cholesterol is important, we also wanted to know whether the incentives actually translated to increased compliance with the medication regimen. Other factors beyond the medication usage (diet, genetics, etc.) may have impacted participants’ cholesterol levels, so it would be interesting to know if the cholesterol results were confirmed by the medication adherence findings. The story does a nice job describing some of the subtle downsides associated with the pay-for-taking-meds approach as well as the side effects of the meds themselves. All four groups in the study, even those who did not receive any payment, were issued electronic pill bottles. As one commenter said “they might have felt they were being watched.” The bottles sent a signal of some sort when opened, so that researchers would know who opened the top. Another commenter pointed out that if money as incentive works for a short-term, how do we know patients would continue past the payment stage? These limitations are part of why one outside commenter described the results as “a nice first step.” The story makes clear the methods and comparison in the randomized controlled study, and the quality of evidence. It includes important elements like study size and study design, and it touches on some limitations. There is no disease mongering. The story goes beyond just “satisfactory.” Extra stars for including a patient (who was not involved) who is an advocate in this area, as well as researchers not involved in the study. The piece does a great job on this. The alternatives in this case would be other ways to motivate patients to take statins, and we think the story does this well. The story makes clear that paying cash to patients to take medicine is an experimental idea, not something that your local doctor is likely to offer. But with that said, it might have been helpful to ask one of the sources about how widespread this approach is and in what contexts it is being used (there are examples around the country). The story accurately suggests that’s what’s novel here is paying both patients and physicians to improve compliance. The story could have been clearer about the fact that there are a number of other studies looking at patient financial incentives. The story mentions one example (related to smoking) in the introduction, but it could have gone further. The story does not rely on a news release, but is a fine example of where extra reporting can provide context.",true,"Researchers studied about 1,500 patients with blood cholesterol levels that put them at risk for heart disease and stroke to try to encourage them (via cash) to take their medicines – statins. Results were mixed, but the doctor-and-patient pairs who both received cash rewards showed the best results in lowering cholesterol levels. This story does an excellent job of explaining the study, providing great context on the underlying problems related to medication adherence, and quoting experts not involved in the study This is a lucid and well-rounded article on a very interesting topic. Solving behavioral issues that prevent patients from taking their medications is an important challenge. Even in this study, even with rewards, fewer than half the patients treated for high cholesterol levels kept taking their medication as prescribed. Many of the established Good Ideas in medicine (medications, etc) are stymied by downstream hurdles — doctors don’t prescribe the treatment as often as they should, patients don’t follow through, etc. Statins are a great example. It is really important to examine these gaps and design clever, cost-effective ways to close them.","A study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that paying patients and doctors cash incentives can significantly improve medication adherence. The study involved four patient groups, with the group that received incentives for both patients and doctors showing the greatest improvement in blood cholesterol levels. This group experienced a drop of 33.6 points in LDL cholesterol, compared to a drop of 25.1 points in the group that received no money. The study also used electronic pill bottles that sent a signal when opened, allowing researchers to monitor medication adherence.

However, the article raises questions about the practicality and cost of implementing such a program. It highlights the need to analyze whether the amounts paid in the study, up to $1,024 over a year, would be worth it in terms of avoiding the costs of treating heart attacks and strokes. The article also mentions the potential limitations of the pay-for-taking-meds approach, such as patients potentially discontinuing medication after the payment stage.

The story acknowledges the importance of quantifying the drops in cholesterol but suggests that it would be valuable to know if the incentives actually translated into increased medication adherence. It also discusses the downsides associated with the pay-for-taking-meds approach, including the side effects of the medications themselves.

The article emphasizes that paying cash to patients to take medicine is an experimental idea and not something that local doctors are likely to offer. However, it could have provided more information on the prevalence and contexts in which this approach is being used. The story mentions that paying both patients and physicians to improve compliance is what makes this study novel, but it could have been clearer about other studies looking at patient financial incentives.

Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the study, including its methods, comparison, and limitations. It includes perspectives from researchers not involved in the study and a patient advocate in the field. The story is commended for addressing the cost trade-offs and providing important context.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

577,577,18254,"Some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies"" but want to cut food stamps.","Congress is deciding whether to reform the nation’s farm subsidy system and, while it is at it, will probably cut the amount it dedicates to food stamps for the poor and low-income workers. Both programs are part of what’s known as the farm bill, the five-year authorization that sets the terms for government crop assistance and defines eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. It turns out that some Congress members receive farm subsidies themselves, or get them through farms and corporations they and their relatives own. Whether they should or shouldn’t is not for us to say. Proponents and opponents of the subsidies, primarily direct payments made to farm owners, can be found in both political parties. But U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, finds it disconcerting that some of the lawmakers who gladly take the government’s subsidies want to cut SNAP, or subsidies to people who need help buying groceries. Discussing the 2013 farm bill, which recently passed in the Senate and is under debate in the House, Brown told reporters on a conference call on June 12, ""There's a lot of pressure in the House of Representatives to just emasculate the SNAP program. For whatever reason, some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies. They think they earned that, and on the other hand, then they want to cut food stamps, and I think that's morally wrong."" We cannot read the minds of subsidy recipients, so we will not judge whether Congress members -- who earn $174,000 federal salaries -- think they have earned the right to farm subsidies. But Brown’s claim struck us as worth examining. Examples were easy to find. The Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an advocacy and research group, maintains a database of federal farm subsidies and has run lawmakers’ names to see what they or their families are getting. News organizations have used this database (and the public can, too), and some have noted where the recipients stand on food stamps, or SNAP. For instance: * Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, ""who supports billions of dollars in cuts to the food stamp program,"" is ""one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies, according to new annual data released by a Washington environmental group."" This was in the New York Times on May 22. Fincher, from Frog Jump, Tenn., and his wife ""collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012,"" reported the Times, using EWG data. In 2012 alone, the couple received about $70,000 in direct payments, which is ""money that is given to farmers and farmland owners, even if they do not grow crops,"" the Times wrote. During debate in May on whether to cut $20.5 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years, Fincher, a Republican, said, ""We have to remember there is not a big printing press in Washington that continually prints money over and over. This is other people’s money that Washington is appropriating and spending."" * Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California and his wife, Jill, together own one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which in 2012 alone got $188,570 in direct farm payments from the federal government, according to the EWG. That would put last year’s subsidies to LaMalfa and his wife at $62,857. But going back to 1995, the DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership has received $5.13 million, which would put the share of Rep. LaMalfa and his wife at $1.7 million, EWG said. In May, LaMalfa won a House amendment that would require electronic fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He said in a statement then, ""The success of the food stamp program should be measured by how many Americans become self-sufficient, not how many are added to the rolls."" * Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997, according to the EWG. Stutzman, a Republican, recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, deeper than the $20.5 billion now on the table, saying, ""Everyone in Washington talks about deficit reduction but we’ve introduced a real, responsible plan to save taxpayer dollars. Over the past decade, SNAP spending has doubled as this program outgrows its original mission of providing temporary assistance."" The list goes on. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, both reviewing the same EWG data as other media, noted that 15 members of Congress got farm subsidies in 2012. (None were from Ohio.) Thirteen were Republicans and two were Democrats. The Democrats were in the Senate -- Michael Bennett of Colorado and Jon Tester of Montana, who says he is the Senate’s only ""working farmer."" Both voted June 10 for the Senate version of the farm bill, which would cut SNAP by $4 billion, or about $16 billion less than the House GOP leaders want. Brown, too, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored. It’s fairly obvious where this leaves Brown’s claim that some House members accepted ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" in farm subsidies but are eager to cut food stamps. But before ruling, we’ll note in fairness that some of the farm-subsidy recipients told the Wall Street Journal that the farm programs need reform, too. Fincher issued a statement saying, ""I voted immediately to remove direct payments,"" the Journal wrote. And, the Journal added, a spokesman for LaMalfa said the lawmaker has long opposed the farm-subsidy system and voted to end direct payments. In Stutzman’s case, the receipt of subsidies was a political issue in his 2010 election. But he maintained to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that the farm-support system is like a mandate, giving him no choice. The farmer ""has to take it,"" he told the Journal Gazette in 2010. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the program is voluntary. OK, so maybe he and the others didn’t like it one bit when they got farm subsidies. We’re not here to judge their motives. But we are here to judge Brown’s claim. It is .",true,Sen. Sherrod Brown says lawmakers who take farm subsidies would cut food stamps,"The article discusses the issue of members of Congress receiving farm subsidies while also supporting cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps. The author examines examples of lawmakers who receive farm subsidies and their stance on SNAP. 

One example is Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, who supports cuts to the food stamp program but is also one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies. Fincher and his wife collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012, with $70,000 in direct payments in 2012 alone. During the debate on cutting SNAP, Fincher argued that the government should not continuously print money and that it is other people's money being spent.

Another example is Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California, who owns one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which received $188,570 in direct farm payments in 2012. Since 1995, the partnership has received $5.13 million in subsidies. LaMalfa won an amendment that would require fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He believes the success of the food stamp program should be measured by self-sufficiency rather than the number of people on the rolls.

Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997. He recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, stating that the program has outgrown its original mission. 

The article also mentions that 15 members of Congress received farm subsidies in 2012, with 13 being Republicans and 2 being Democrats. The Democrats who received subsidies voted for a Senate version of the farm bill that would cut SNAP by $4 billion, while Brown, a Democrat, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored.

The author acknowledges that some of the subsidy recipients have expressed the need for reform in the farm subsidy system. Fincher, for example, voted to remove direct payments, and LaMalfa has long opposed the farm subsidy system. Stutzman has argued that the farm-support system is like a mandate and farmers have no choice but to take it.

In conclusion, the article examines the claim made by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown that some House members who receive farm subsidies also want to cut food stamps. The examples provided support Brown's claim, but it is noted that some subsidy recipients have expressed the need for reform in the farm subsidy system.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

584,584,29354,"Three additives in peanut butter cups, soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ, are inherently dangerous and should be avoided.","On 24 March 2017, David “Avocado” Wolfe, prolific pseudoscience media mogul, purveyor of life-extending USB-chargeable “longevity zappers”, and self-described “wealthiest hippie on Earth”, published a post that went viral on Facebook titled “3 Reasons Why You Should Stop Eating Peanut Butter Cups!” This post, though essentially a word-for-word rip-off of a 2015 post from a website named “Living Traditionally,” is still somehow classic Wolfe: a highly shareable story crafted at the expense of a beloved childhood candy through the willful misrepresentation of the science surrounding its ingredients. In this case, Wolfe (or whoever wrote the article) points to three chemicals which, as a matter of fact, are present in Reese’s Peanut Butter cups: Soy Lecithin Research has shown that as much as 93% of soy is genetically modified. Soy lecithin has been found to have detrimental effects on fertility and reproduction. It can cause behavioral and cerebral abnormalities. It has also been linked to breast cancer. PGPR PGPR is short for polyglycerol polyricinoleate. The manufacturer of this popular candy replaced cocoa butter with PGPR to lower the cost of production. PGPR comes from castor beans and it’s used to reduce the viscosity of chocolate. It has been connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children. TBHQ TBHQ stands for tertiary butylhdroquinone. It’s derived from petroleum and can be extremely toxic. Side effects of ingesting TBHQ include nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, delirium and collapse. Research has shown that TBHQ can damage the lungs and umbilical cells in humans. It can also cause stomach cancer. Children who are exposed to this chemical may show anxiety, restlessness and intensified ADHD symptoms. Soy Lecithin Lecithin is a mixture of naturally organic compounds separated from their source by way of their shared chemical properties and added to a variety of foods to improve texture and aid in the mixing of ingredients. As defined by the United States Code of Federal Regulations: Commercial lecithin is a naturally occurring mixture of the phosphatides [derivatives of a specific chemical] of choline, ethanolamine, and inositol, with smaller amounts of other lipids. It is isolated as a gum following hydration of solvent-extracted soy, safflower, or corn oils. In terms of the soy-GMO link, this issue is somewhat moot because If GMO’s aren’t a person’s jam, then that individual probably wouldn’t be purchasing Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups anyway, as the Hershey’s Company discloses the possibility of GMO ingredients, broadly, in this line of products. The remaining claims are either misleading or factually impoverished. To support the notion that soy lecithin has “detrimental effects on fertility and reproduction”, causes “behavioral and cerebral abnormalities” and has been “linked to breast cancer”, the author of the post links to a different post by “Dr. Axe”, a naturopathic doctor, chiropractor, and nutritionist. In this post, Axe briefly mentions a largely irrelevant 1985 study that looked at the effects of feeding pregnant laboratory rats and their offspring with an absurdly high soy lecithin diet. In that study, rats were given 10 grams of standardized of food per day with either 2 percent or 5 percent of the mass of that food replaced by soy lecithin. This study, which had a narrow and specific aim of investigating a proposed mechanism behind a number of neurologic conditions, found that: The results indicate that dietary soy lecithin preparation enrichment during development leads to behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities in the exposed offspring. However, the amount of lecithin used in this experiment are multiple orders of magnitude more than any human could reasonably expect to be exposed to, even on a daily basis. Using the rough estimate 1800 grams of food consumed per day by the average human, a 5 percent lecithin diet would represent 90 grams of soy lecithin per day, which is roughly 1000 times more soy lecithin than the FDA estimates Americans get in their daily diet through additives (96 milligrams per day). Using an over 30 year old study of pregnant and developing rats fed absurdly unrealistic doses of a chemical to say that peanut butter cups are dangerous is a reach, even by Wolfe standards. By FDA “Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)” standards: There is no evidence in the available information on lecithin and lecithin bleached with hydrogen peroxide that demonstrates or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect a hazard to the public when they are used at levels that are now current or that might reasonably be expected in the future. The remaining claims regarding breast cancer, fertility, and reproduction are made by conflating soy protein and soy lecithin. Soy protein is chemically similarity to estrogen, a point that has been the subject of much scientific and internet debate about its potential adverse affects. While the mechanisms linking soy to any hormone-derived maladies have yet to be demonstrated, it is another moot point, as at most only trace amounts of soy protein, if any, remain in soy lecithin. PGPR Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), per Food and Industrial Bioproducts and Bioprocessing, is a common additive that is used: For improved texture and enhanced volume of bakery products, in salad dressings, and in chocolate to decrease the occurrence of fat bloom [a visual separation of fat from the rest of the chocolate]. While not hesitating to use its scary scientific name, the only allegation of note the Wolfe post makes is that PGPR has been “connected” to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children. Ignoring the fact that the same could be said about the ingredients in the natural version of peanut butter cups presented below Wolfe’s article, it is also a broad misrepresentation of PGPR’s risk, which is, at best, negligible. The most recent review of its safety, performed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and adopted on 3 March 2017, reaffirmed its safety: PGPR […] is not of concern with regard to genotoxicity or carcinogenicity. The single reproductive toxicity study with PGPR was limited and was not an appropriate study for deriving a health-based guidance value. Human studies with PGPR demonstrated that there is no indication of significant adverse effect. TBHQ TBHQ, used as an antioxidant preservative in many food items, is indeed a petroleum derivative (as are almost all carbon containing compounds not produced by living organisms), but that doesn’t mean it carries the same risks as ingesting raw petroleum sludge — it’s a specific, singular, isolated, and modified chemical. There have, in fact, been animal studies that report harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ as well as other cases of extremely high or chronic exposure resulting in harm. As we wrote in a similar Wolfe debunker about the dangers of Pop Tarts, however, while the long-term health effects in humans exposed to high or chronic doses of TBQH (i.e. industrial or laboratory workers handing pure TBHQ occupationally) is not a settled issue, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses legally allowed by USA and European regulatory agencies is settled. EFSA reevaluated its earlier (similar) conclusion regarding TBQH in 2004, finding that it is “not carcinogenic and that further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary.” The Wolfe post also claims that children exposed to TBHQ “may show anxiety, restlessness and intensified ADHD symptoms” despite the fact that no peer-reviewed studies link TBHQ specifically to ADHD, restlessness, or anxiety. This notion stems from the controversial ideas of Dr. Benjamin Feingold, who advocates the removal of myriad food additives, including TBHQ, as a cure for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and other behavioral issues. Despite his claims, however, no research specifically focused on TBHQ has documented any connection, and those diets he promotes generally treat a broad collection of additives as the same, despite clear chemical differences.",false,"Ultimately, the claims presented in Wolfe’s post rely on outdated, irrelevant, or factually incomplete information. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups do, along with many other foods, contain the listed ingredients. This point, however, is close to the only factual one made by the author of the post.","The article debunks the claim that three additives in peanut butter cups, soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ, are inherently dangerous and should be avoided. It explains that the claim is misleading and factually impoverished. 

Regarding soy lecithin, the article states that it is a naturally occurring mixture of organic compounds and is added to foods to improve texture and aid in mixing. The claim that soy lecithin has detrimental effects on fertility, causes behavioral and cerebral abnormalities, and is linked to breast cancer is based on a study that used extremely high doses of soy lecithin on pregnant laboratory rats. The amount of soy lecithin used in the study is much higher than what humans would consume, even on a daily basis. The FDA considers lecithin and lecithin bleached with hydrogen peroxide to be safe for consumption.

Regarding PGPR, the article explains that it is a common additive used to improve texture and volume in bakery products, salad dressings, and chocolate. The claim that PGPR is connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children is a misrepresentation of its risk, which is negligible. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has reaffirmed the safety of PGPR.

Regarding TBHQ, the article acknowledges that it is a petroleum derivative but states that it is a specific, isolated, and modified chemical. While there have been animal studies reporting harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses allowed by regulatory agencies are settled. The EFSA has found that TBHQ is not carcinogenic and further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary. The claim that children exposed to TBHQ may show anxiety, restlessness, and intensified ADHD symptoms is not supported by peer-reviewed studies specifically linking TBHQ to these conditions.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ in peanut butter cups are inherently dangerous. It explains that the claims made about these additives are either misleading or based on unrealistic doses used in studies. Regulatory agencies have deemed these additives safe for consumption.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

586,586,10484,Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment,"The story mentions that some patients have flown to Europe and spent their life savings on the procedure, and an expert calls the procedure “costly to patients.” So we can probably assume that the procedure is unlikely to be covered by major insurers or Medicare (who would cover those with chronic disability), and that the costs will run into the tens of thousands of dollars or more. This is important information for the typical patient who isn’t wealthy enough to carry this kind of cost burden. The story could have been more explicit about all of this and provided more specifics about the financial aspects of the procedure. However, we think the main point to convey here is that the surgery is expensive and patients will have to pay their own way. The story does this — though barely — so we’ll award a satisfactory. We should start here by recognizing this story’s unusual choice of patient to profile in the opening paragraphs. The convention with a “miracle” treatment like this is to lead with a patient who experienced a dramatic benefit which is often unrepresentative of typical results. In this case, though, the story primes us to expect something miraculous and then delivers the mundane truth: “it didn’t work.” We wish more stories focused on patients who represent the complicated reality of health care instead of pumping up best case scenarios. With that being said, we feel the story should have done more to describe the range of outcomes that have been reported with this procedure as well as the need for better studies. For example, it didn’t take our reviewers long to identify preliminary case series data that could have been cited. Though uncontrolled studies like this one are prone to bias that can lead to inflated estimates of benefits, we think these published results — if carefully and responsibly explained — could have helped readers better understand the excitement surrounding the treatment. Alternately, the story could have sought out the perspective of doctors who have performed the procedure to get their take. As it stands, the coverage is dominated by the perspectives of a single unsuccessfully treated patient and a skeptical researcher, so it’s difficult for readers to grasp why there has been such a heated public debate about the surgery. The story mentions life-threatening blood clots are a risk of the procedure, and notes that people have died from the surgery. It also quotes an expert who calls the procedure “unsafe.” It would have been nice to have some statistics on adverse effects to help readers weigh these risks for themselves, but it may be too early in the game to expect this kind of systematic data. At this point in the development of an experimental treatment, the priority for a story like this is to make sure potential harms are given adequate emphasis — something this story accomplished handily. This story cites conflicting studies about whether vein blockages play any role in MS, and it allows one researcher to confidently proclaim that these problems are “not the cause of MS.” However, the story never discusses any actual data or tells us how this researcher arrived at his conclusions. The story does note that differences in technical training between investigative groups may explain the discrepancies observed in different studies, but what about the other criteria upon which scientific evidence is supposed to be judged — i.e. the type of study (observational or intervention), number of patients, blinding, use of control groups, size of the effects observed, etc.? These factors should have been addressed more explicitly to establish the basis for competing points of view. A second and arguably more important question is whether treating vein blockages actually improves symptoms in patients with MS. Again, the story sets a skeptical tone but doesn’t justify it with a discussion of evidence (or lack of evidence). Although there was no overt disease-mongering, the story focuses exclusively on the story of a patient who had an aggressive case of the disease. MS can manifest itself in a variety of different ways, and his experience is not representative of patients with mild and slowly progressing MS. Also, not everyone with MS has the vascular abnormalities discussed in this story, and so would presumably not benefit from this procedure. Finally, the story should have explained that MS is a condition characterized by flare-ups that often get better by themselves, so it’s hard to tell if “miraculous” recoveries are attributable to the surgery or are just the natural course of the disease for these patients. A bit more context on these issues would have been helpful, but we don’t think the story deserved to be flagged for not including it. The story quotes two experts who are involved in studies of vein abnormalities and potential links to MS, and their perspectives are a valuable addition to the story. However, both of these researchers (Dr. Robert Fox and Dr. Robert Zivadinov) have reported relationships with companies that make drugs to treat MS. To avoid the appearance of any conflict, the story should have alerted readers to these relationships. The study focuses exclusively on this novel surgical procedure. It should have at least mentioned that there are FDA-approved drug treatments for MS. The article implies that there aren’t yet a lot of doctors performing this procedure, but it isn’t clear. Early in the story we learn of a patient who recently had the procedure performed in New York, but later on the story says that Canadians and Americans are going to Europe to have the surgery. Are there not enough doctors in North America who are trained to perform this procedure? Or are there regulatory, legal, or financial issues that are preventing patients in North America from getting it done here? The story should have told us. The story tells us that the idea behind the procedure was first proposed in 2008, making the concept quite novel. It noted that despite the catchy name, the “liberation procedure” is actually very similar to balloon angioplasty performed regularly on coronary arteries. The story is clearly not based on a news release.",mixture,"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected. The problem is that in the desperate search for a cure, patients, family and providers can seek out risky and expensive treatments that haven’t been adequately studied.","The article discusses a controversial surgical procedure called the ""liberation procedure"" that is being used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The procedure involves opening up blocked veins in the neck and chest to improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms of MS. The article mentions that some patients have traveled to Europe and spent their life savings on the procedure, indicating that it is unlikely to be covered by major insurers or Medicare. The costs of the procedure are said to run into the tens of thousands of dollars or more.

The article criticizes the choice of patient profiled in the opening paragraphs, as the patient did not experience any benefit from the procedure. The article suggests that stories should focus on patients who represent the complicated reality of healthcare instead of promoting best-case scenarios. It also argues that the article should have provided more information about the range of outcomes reported with the procedure and the need for better studies.

The article mentions that the procedure carries risks, including life-threatening blood clots, and quotes an expert who calls it ""unsafe."" However, it notes that there are no statistics on adverse effects available at this point in the development of the treatment.

The article criticizes the lack of discussion about the scientific evidence supporting the procedure and whether it actually improves symptoms in MS patients. It also points out that the patient profiled in the article had an aggressive case of MS, which may not be representative of all patients with the disease.

The article suggests that conflicts of interest should have been disclosed, as the researchers quoted in the article have reported relationships with companies that make drugs to treat MS. It also questions why there are not more doctors performing the procedure in North America and whether there are regulatory or financial issues preventing patients from accessing it.

Overall, the article argues that the story should have provided more information about the financial aspects, range of outcomes, scientific evidence, conflicts of interest, and availability of alternative treatments for MS.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

596,596,30817,Authorities in Kenya warned of a new outbreak of HPV that spreads through kissing and is deadlier than HIV/Aids.,"In November 2017, unreliable web sites spread a fabricated story about a so-called “new outbreak” of human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to genital warts and various cancers. The Native Love web site wrote: Students from Kisii University, Kenya and the general public at large have been warned against kissing carelessly due to an outbreak of Human papilloma virus, which has seen several people admitted at Kisii level 5 hospital after testing positive to the disease. The HPV is gradually circulating Kenya and gradually making its way into the Southern parts of Africa and will soon hit Africa at large. Africans are believed to travel a lot to all parts of the world. So if proper awareness is not created, this is likely to hit the whole world in no distance time. You are hereby advised to warn and inform family members, friends, well wishers and colleagues about this deadly disease that kills faster than HIV/AIDS. The same article was published by Discover Newz and The Daily Berries. It also had a previous iteration in a March 2017 story published by HIN News South Africa. The earliest version of the story that we found dates from May 2016, and was published by Trending In Kenya, a web site that is registered in Nairobi and posts fake articles alleging devil worship and alien creatures, and sensationalist celebrity gossip. Mzansi Live, which is listed by the fact-checking agency Africa Check as a known fake news web site in South Africa, also published the story, but notably switched the location of the university in question from Kenya to Johannesburg. There is no truth to the story, which is not corroborated by any reporting in reliable local news media. The World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa has made no reference to any particular “outbreak” of HPV in recent years. HPV is a collection of strains of viral infection, transmitted by skin and mucous membrane contact (rather than the exchange of bodily fluids) during a variety of sexual activities. It is the world’s most common sexually transmitted infection, but in most cases does not come with harmful symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Which is why an HPV infection can go undetected for decades. Certain strains of HPV can lead to genital warts and various types of cancer, including cervical and oral cancer. If a case of HPV does result in a cancerous tumor, it often takes years and even decades to develop, according to the National Cancer Institute. So the fake articles present an implausible and misleading picture of free-kissing college students suddenly falling deathly ill and being admitted to hospital due to an outbreak of HPV. That is simply not how HPV spreads, and it is not an accurate depiction of its repercussions. According to Nechama Brodie, who runs the research and training division of Africa Check, fabricated health scares such as this one are universal, but also occur within a very specific context. “This plays into a well-established trope of poorly-informed myths around healthcare in Africa,” Brodie told us by phone from South Africa. The juxtaposition of HPV and HIV is no accident. “It’s confusing HPV with HIV, and HIV is still a big ‘scare factor,'” Brodie adds. HIV/AIDS looms large in this article, a long shadow cast by the damage it has inflicted in Africa (particularly Southern Africa). The fundamental message conveyed by the story is “this is worse than AIDS,” Brodie says, adding there are rumors HIV “doesn’t exist, [or] HIV was invented by white colonialists, [or] it was introduced to control the black population,” among others. In addition to this strain of misinformation, there are false claims about what causes HIV to spread, and how it could be cured. The apex of this, according to Brodie, came during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki in South Africa during the early 2000’s. Mbeki indulged in “HIV/AIDS denialism,” supported theories that herbal remedies and vitamins could cure AIDS and — most damagingly — refused to approve the provision of cheap antiretroviral drugs.",false,"The HPV story, according to Brodie, exists in that climate of confusion and misinformation, and exploits it.","The claim that there is a new outbreak of HPV in Kenya that spreads through kissing and is deadlier than HIV/AIDS is false. The article states that unreliable websites spread this fabricated story, and there is no corroboration from reliable local news media or the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa.

While HPV is the world's most common sexually transmitted infection, it usually does not come with harmful symptoms and can go undetected for decades.

The fake articles present an implausible and misleading picture of college students falling ill and being admitted to the hospital due to an outbreak of HPV, which is not how HPV spreads or its repercussions. The article also highlights the context of fabricated health scares in Africa, particularly around HIV/AIDS. The juxtaposition of HPV and HIV is intentional, as HIV/AIDS is still a significant concern in Africa. The article mentions the prevalence of misinformation about HIV/AIDS, including claims that it doesn't exist or was invented by white colonialists. It also mentions the damaging effects of HIV/AIDS denialism during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki in South Africa, where cheap antiretroviral drugs were not approved. In summary, the claim of a new outbreak of HPV in Kenya that spreads through kissing and is deadlier than HIV/AIDS is false and part of a larger context of misinformation surrounding healthcare in Africa.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The release started with a useful explanation of the study’s design, but neglected to mention this study was an extended observation of a small subgroup of patients studied in an earlier trial. The initial trial covered 4.7 years, during which no benefit was evident; this study followed a subset of patients for another 5 years. The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon. And the release never cautions readers as to the many limitations of this subgroup analysis, particularly the fact that the findings in this small group might reflect factors other than the effects of the medication. The release hints at this concern when it says “a randomized study is needed to confirm these findings,” but a more direct acknowledgment was needed.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Context: The article discusses a segment on network news about a new experimental approach called transdermal direct current stimulation (TDCS) for treating chronic pain.

Fedrick noticed a girl with greasy blonde hair sitting next to an older man who appeared well-dressed. The stark contrast between the two raised alarm bells for Fedrick. She tried to engage them in conversation, but the man became defensive. Fedrick discreetly left a note in one of the bathrooms, asking the girl if she needed help. The girl responded by writing on the note, ""I need help."" When the plane landed, police were waiting in the terminal and the girl was saved from the trafficker.\n\nThis story gained public attention in 2017 through a glowing NBC News account. However, some skeptics questioned the veracity of the story. The incident had not been reported until six years after it took place, and there was no independent verification of the details. Aviation journalist Christine Negroni reported that Alaska Airlines declined to confirm or provide any information about the incident. The San Francisco Airport had no record of the event, and the San Francisco Police Department did not mention any trafficking busts based on flight attendant tips in their archives.\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown also noted that the news reports lacked detail and follow-up. There was no information about the alleged trafficker\'s fate or the victim\'s background. Attempts to obtain verifying information about the incident were unsuccessful, as Alaska Airlines stated they could not comment and could not put anyone in touch with Fedrick.\n\nWhile the lack of public records does not necessarily mean the incident did not happen, it raises doubts about the accuracy of the story.

This optimism is attributed to a changing definition of aging, with people working longer and seeing older individuals living healthier lives. The survey also found that many seniors feel financially secure, but nearly half of low- and middle-income seniors are not confident about covering their expenses in the next five to ten years. Additionally, a third of older Americans do not believe they will be able to afford long-term care, and a major financial event would result in a fiscal crisis for one in five seniors. Lower income seniors are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses and less likely to exercise. The impact of the recession has led many seniors to continue working either full- or part-time. The majority of seniors also expressed a desire to ""age in place"" and live in their own homes for the next decade, although less than half of seniors in their 70s believed they could live independently. The survey also highlighted concerns about a lack of community resources and facilities to support independent living.

The article states that unreliable websites spread this fabricated story, and there is no corroboration from reliable local news media or the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa. HPV is a collection of viral infections transmitted through skin and mucous membrane contact during sexual activities, not through kissing. While HPV is the world's most common sexually transmitted infection, it usually does not come with harmful symptoms and can go undetected for decades. Certain strains of HPV can lead to genital warts and various types of cancer, but it often takes years or even decades for cancerous tumors to develop. The fake articles present an implausible and misleading picture of college students falling ill and being admitted to the hospital due to an outbreak of HPV, which is not how HPV spreads or its repercussions.

620,620,17852,The Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program because of the government shutdown.,"The government shutdown has cranked up the volume on the blame game of who is causing the most misery for whom. The latest move comes from the right, where accusations began to fly that President Barack Obama was willing to put missing children’s lives at risk to score political points. From what we found, the claim started in the Twitterverse with tweets late on Friday night, Oct. 4, 2013. ""Did u see how the amber alert system was shut down & they even produced a screen to declare it!?"" said one. Amber Alert is the system that draws the public into the hunt for an abducted child. The Right Scoop carried the message to a wider audience. At around 5 p.m. Sunday, it posted that the U.S. Justice Department Web page for the Amber Alert program was down. ""I’m sure you care about your lost child but Obama doesn’t – at least not while he’s trying to ‘win’ the government shutdown,"" the blog post said. The Drudge Report put that item on its homepage with the headline, ""Amber Alert website shut down, Michelle’s ‘Let’s Move’ stays up."" By the next morning, the Washington Examiner’s Mark Tapscott had an article titled, ""Obama shutters Amber Alerts as government shutdown enters second week."" ""Somebody, somewhere in the Obama White House or the Obama Justice Department decided to shut down the Amber Alerts, despite the system's long and stellar record of helping locate missing children,"" Tapscott wrote. Two congressmen, Stephen Fincher, R-Tenn, and Steve Stockman, R-Texas, added their own tweets into the mix, echoing the theme that Obama was playing politics with kids. By mid-morning Monday, the government Web page was back up, but chastising tweets continued. We decided to check out exactly what had been shut down, and by whom. Federal action If you went to the federal Amber Alert Web page on Sunday, you would have found this message ""Due to the lapse in Federal funding, this Office of Justice Program website is unavailable."" That is what triggered the blog postings, tweets and articles. A Justice Department spokesperson explained to the Huffington Post, ""All the sites that had to go offline were put behind a firewall so that they couldn't be hacked while the IT people were on furlough."" The spokesman said a furloughed worker was brought back Monday to put the site back online. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave the reason for that move at his press briefing later that day. ""To eliminate any confusion among the public about the status of the program. A furloughed Justice Department employee was called in to work in order to restore the informational site,"" Carney said. ""But again, it’s informational. The system itself was never interrupted."" We contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit that assists local and state authorities in this work. According to their data, over this weekend, at the same time the tweets and blog posts were building, the Amber Alert was activated twice: in Texas on Oct. 4 and in Florida on Oct. 5. At the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, spokesperson Gretl Plessinger said the news stories about the federal website had prompted some people to call out of concern. Plessinger reassured the public that Florida's program ""is operating as it always has."" We also got in touch with Gene Thaxton of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, who coordinates the Amber Alert system for that state. Thaxton was emphatic that the program never closed. ""Oklahoma has its own Amber Alert program, and it is not affected by the government shutdown,"" he said. ""The federal Web page is informational. It doesn’t affect the operations of the program."" To be clear, the Amber Alert system is not run by Washington. States set up their own programs and use guidelines and standards that are shared nationwide. The program is a network of these state-run operations. At the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, spokesman Bob Hoever told us that the federal Web page plays no role in actually finding children. Hoever said local or state law enforcement officials trigger an Amber Alert when authorities have details like the name of the child, a photo of the child, the kind of car involved, a plate number, or a photo of the suspect. ""Those are the things that have led to a rescue in the past,"" he said. State authorities then notify the media and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The center spreads the word through the Web and over cell phones, sending automatic text messages to everyone with a smart phone in the area where officials think the child might be. ""We had a case in Minnesota where a teenager read the text on her phone, and there across the street was the car,"" Hoever said. ""She told her dad, and he called the police, and they rescued the child."" Hoever said as far as he knows, from the initial investigation to the public reports of a possible sighting, the federal website has never been involved. ""If people knew how this worked, we wouldn’t be dealing with this confusion,"" he said. Our ruling People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida. The one sliver of truth that triggered this claim is that a federal webpage promoting the program was closed, but that did not affect the program itself.

The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year. The cost of travel, proximity, borders, and quality of care are factors that potential medical tourists consider.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer.

Amber Alerts are emergency messages that are broadcast when a law enforcement agency determines that a child has been abducted and is in imminent danger.

The federal website promotes the program and issues guidelines, but it has no active role in issuing amber alerts. While it’s also correct to observe that funding for the amber alert program comes from a mixture of federal, state, and local resources. The office of justice programs, which oversees the amber alert program, is not paid directly by the federal government. Instead, its funding flows from the Department of Justice to state and local partners.

The action has affected users nationwide and the plans of international companies including Juul Labs Inc and Philip Morris International, as well as triggering court challenges by local firms. Protesters convened on Saturday to call for vaping devices to be regulated rather than prohibited. But organizers Association of Vapers India said only about 400 people turned up across six cities, adding that some opponents of the ban feared being targeted by police. At one protest in the capital New Delhi, several people used vaping devices. Among them sat a child with a poster that read: “I don’t want my dad to be a smoker”. The government argues the ban is essential to protect people as vaping can lead to nicotine addiction and push users toward consuming tobacco. Vapers say the devices help them stay away from more harmful tobacco cigarettes. More than 900,000 people die each year due to tobacco-related illnesses in India, the government estimates. But the country has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative potential market for companies selling both tobacco and vaping products. An Indian health ministry official said the government was determined to stick by its ban, despite the protests and court challenges. “There is no question of a rollback or anything like that,” the official said. Two court challenges that could be pivotal for whether the ban can continue to be enforced are under way in the eastern city of Kolkata, including one by e-cigarette importer Plume Vapour.

Although the story mentions these options, their related costs are missing in action. The story describes a relationship between vision and cognition, but we never get a feel for how strong that link might be. Although the debits of traditional eye exams are minor, more substantive “fixes” of vision problems mentioned in the story (such as cataract surgery) do bring with them possible risks. While the story does provide some details about the study, such as the number of individuals (more than 2,500) and the length (8 years), its brief description of the study design leaves some key details unexplored. This was a cross-lagged analysis in which a measure of eyesight at time 1 was associated with a cognitive test at time 2. That kind of analysis can make a stab at establishing cause-and-effect if it also examines the opposite relationship (cognitive test at time 1 to visual test at time 2) and finds it to be nonexistent. The analysis actually did this and determined that the visual-to-cognitive test was a stronger relationship than its opposite. But while that fuller explanation would have made the story more complete, it would still omit an important caution: The correlations running in both directions are quite modest. Thus, there is evidence in this study that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, but it seems to play only a minor role. And its impact, if any, would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively. Both cognitive decline and vision loss accompany aging. Neither is necessarily lethal, but seeking to learn if they are related would be beneficial. An invited commentary that accompanied the report of this research in the Journal of the American Medical Association Ophthalmology describes a number of studies exploring this relationship in recent years, The study was funded by the National Eye Institute and the Jane Kroger Fund. It would have been beneficial to include the funding sources in the story. However, omitting the name of a government or non-profit funder does not merit a Not Satisfactory rating. The story mentions several approaches to maintaining eyesight. Mentioning other possible approaches to preventing cognitive decline (diet, exercise, etc.) would’ve been a bonus. The story implies that the vision treatments mentioned (“a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts”) are available in the marketplace, which is accurate. Although the commentary in the JAMA Ophthalmology issue where the research appears makes the point that this study’s effort to introduce causality into the vision/cognition relationship is a “new dimension,” that novel element is not made clear in the story. It’s clear there was some original reporting done, and the story didn’t rely excessively on any news release.",mixture,"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together.

The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options. But such behavior awaits more robust studies, and stories about this link need to tread cautiously.","The article discusses a study that suggests maintaining healthy vision may also help keep the brain in shape. The study, funded by the National Eye Institute and the Jane Kroger Fund, involved over 2,500 individuals over a period of 8 years.

The analysis found that the relationship between vision and cognition was stronger in the direction of vision to cognition, rather than the opposite. However, the correlations in both directions were modest. The article mentions that while there is evidence that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, its impact would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively.

The article also mentions the high costs associated with maintaining visual capabilities in the United States, including diagnostic visits, expensive eyewear, and medical procedures for age-related problems like cataracts and macular degeneration. However, the article does not provide specific details about the costs of these options. It also does not provide a clear understanding of the strength of the link between vision and cognition.

714,714,9364,This Blood Test Could Help Predict If A Pregnancy Is At Risk For Premature Labor,"Experimental health tests don’t have public price tags. However, this story gives readers a rare and helpful ballpark estimate, and one that compares it to an alternative (ultrasound): “It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,” a study author told BuzzFeed. The story lists out many of the details about what the researchers measured, and how those results compare to the current standard assessment tools, such as ultrasound. Readers don’t get a sense of what harms a false-positive test might expose a mother and her child too, and the rate here (nearly 17%) is rather high. Based on studies of the alternative test method — i.e. ultrasound — the risks of false-positive test/misdiagnosis include high stress and anxiety, depression, expensive and unnecessary treatments, and other possible harms. (The most common interventions for increased risk of preterm birth include progesterone supplements and bedrest.) For a story targeting the general public, all of our skeptical itches are scratched in this criterion. We’re told in fairly plain English how the tests works to pick up genetic material, and that it’s already used by other blood tests. We also get a short synopsis of the study’s limitations, with the story describing how it was small (with 38 women) and didn’t include ethnicities other than white or black. Finally, some rare yet illustrative numbers on efficacy are provided: false-positive results (3 in 18 pregnancies were supposedly at risk but became full-term) and false-positive results (4 in 5 did become at-risk preterm pregnancies). These types of details stated in plain language really help readers make sense of an otherwise complex study. The story describes some scary risks related to preterm deliveries, but nothing unwarranted to establish why a test for potential preterm deliveries might be important. We don’t get a crucial outside perspective on the study; the only source named in the story is one of the lead authors. On the plus side, the story is very thorough given its short length, and it offers a blunt if not skeptical summary on the research. It also helps that we’re told the study was funded by the March of Dimes and “other nonprofit sources,” and that the authors have applied to patent the blood test, implying they stand to profit from its approval and widespread use. BuzzFeed’s story establishes early on that ultrasound tests are the go-to method for determining pregnancies that are at-risk for preterm delivery, among other complications. It also gives the accuracy of that test as a measure (48%) and compares it to the experimental test’s accuracy (45%). The story is clear about the test’s availability in above-the-fold copy, stating it “is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab.” There’s even a reference to it being experimental in the story summary. (But why not include “experimental” in the headline, too?) The story references other unnamed blood tests that use cfRNA, though it clinches the novelty of the experimental preterm pregnancy test through an anecdote from one of the researchers. However, the story does not comment on other biomarkers (blood tests to detect factors correlated with preterm birth). As context, there have been many other biomarkers studied that have not proven to have clinical utility. Over 72 studies of biomarkers involving almost 90,000 women were examined in a 2011 review, which concluded that none, alone or in combination, were clinically useful to predict spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic women. There is much more work to be done to establish whether this new test performs well, and readers need that critical context. We didn’t detect any obvious signs of copy/pasting claims, researcher quotes, etc.",true,"This BuzzFeed News story reports on early-stage research into an experimental blood test that aims to predict whether or not a pregnancy is at risk for premature birth. To determine that risk, the test looks for specific pieces of RNA generated by the baby that migrate into a mother’s bloodstream and which are associated with preterm deliveries. The story offers a short, readable, un-hyped, and eminently useful summary of the research, and it offers several comparisons to the standard alternative, which is an ultrasound scan. The story would have benefited from an outside expert weighing on the study and its potential ramifications and — more importantly — the potential harms of a false-positive test, which are not insignificant. According to the CDC, preterm birth affects about one in every 10 infants born in the US. Significant advances to lower preterm birth rates are certainly newsworthy–but this is an idea that’s been tested and failed before (see novelty, below) and readers need to know that.","A blood test has been developed that could potentially predict if a pregnancy is at risk for premature labor. The test measures cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in the blood, which is genetic material released by cells that can provide information about the health of the pregnancy. The study, funded by the March of Dimes and other nonprofit sources, involved 38 women and found that the test had a 45% accuracy rate in identifying pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery, compared to the current standard assessment tool, ultrasound, which has a 48% accuracy rate. The test is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab.

The article highlights the potential benefits of the blood test, such as providing a more affordable alternative to ultrasound, which can cost thousands of dollars. However, it also mentions the risks of false-positive results, which can lead to high stress and anxiety, unnecessary treatments, and other possible harms. The rate of false-positive results in the study was nearly 17%.

The article provides a clear explanation of how the test works and its limitations. It mentions that the study was small and only included white and black ethnicities, which limits its generalizability. The article also mentions that the authors have applied to patent the blood test, suggesting they stand to profit from its approval and widespread use.

The article compares the accuracy of the blood test to ultrasound and mentions that ultrasound is currently the go-to method for identifying pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery. It also references other blood tests that use cfRNA but emphasizes the novelty of the experimental preterm pregnancy test.

However, the article does not provide critical context about other biomarkers that have been studied for predicting preterm birth. It mentions that previous studies have not found any biomarkers to be clinically useful in predicting preterm birth in asymptomatic women.

Overall, the article provides a thorough summary of the study and its findings. It includes important details about the test's accuracy, limitations, and potential risks. However, it lacks an outside perspective on the study and does not provide critical context about the challenges of developing biomarkers for predicting preterm birth.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

723,723,3869,California bill would create health care price controls.,"The proposal, which drew swift opposition from the health care industry, comes amid a fierce debate in California as activists on the left push aggressively for a system that would provide government-funded insurance for everyone in the state. Across the country, rising health care costs have put the industry, lawmaker and employers and consumers at odds. The proposal in California would affect private health plans, including those offered by employers and purchased by individuals. A nine-member commission appointed by the governor and legislative leaders would set prices for everything from a physical exam to an allergy test to heart bypass surgery. No other state has such a requirement. “If we do not act now, I’m concerned that health care prices will become unsustainable,” Assemblyman Ash Kalra, a freshman Democrat from San Jose who wrote the legislation, said in a news conference in Sacramento. The measure faces an uphill battle in the Legislature, where lawmakers are generally cautious about making drastic changes to the health care system and are already juggling a wide range of ambitious proposals. The proposal is backed by influential unions including the Service Employees International Union, Unite Here and the Teamsters. The unions are frustrated that health care costs are gobbling an increasing share of employee compensation. “Every dollar that we spend on rising health care prices is a dollar that comes out of a worker’s pocket,” said Sara Flocks, policy coordinator for the California Labor Federation, a union coalition. “This is something that is eating up our wages and it is increasing income inequality. This is a fundamental question of fairness.” Health care providers say price controls would encourage doctors to move out of state or retire, making it harder for people to see a physician when they’re sick, and force hospitals to lay off staff or, in some cases, close their doors. The California Medical Association, which represents physicians, called the proposal “radical” and warned that it would reduce choices for consumers. “No state in America has ever attempted such an unproven policy of inflexible, government-managed price caps across every health care service,” Dr. Theodore Mazer, the CMA president, said in a statement. Under Kalra’s bill, prices would be tied to Medicare’s rate for a particular service or procedure, with that price as a floor. There would be a process for doctors or hospitals to argue that their unique circumstances warrant payments higher than the state’s standard rate. Paying hospitals 125 percent of Medicare’s rate would cut $18 billion in revenue and force them to trim nurses and other support staff, said Dietmar Grellman, senior vice president of the California Hospital Association. Private insurers make up for the low payments from government-funded health care, which doesn’t cover the full cost of care, he said. “That’s why their bill is such an empty promise,” Grellman said. “They take money out of the system with rate regulation, but then they don’t address the huge gaping hole that’s created by Medicare and Medicaid.” In recent decades health care spending has risen faster than inflation and wages while employers and health plans have shifted more of the costs onto consumers through higher premiums, deductibles and copays. Americans spend more per capita on health care than other developed countries. Meanwhile, a wave of consolidation by hospitals, physician groups and insurance companies has given industry players more power to demand higher rates.",true,"California’s government would set prices for hospital stays, doctor visits and other health care services under legislation introduced Monday, vastly remaking the industry in a bid to lower health care costs.","A proposed bill in California aims to create price controls for healthcare services, which has faced opposition from the health care industry. The bill would establish a nine-member commission to set prices for various medical procedures and services, affecting private health plans including those offered by employers and purchased by individuals. The proposal is supported by influential unions who are concerned about rising health care costs eating into employee compensation. However, health care providers argue that price controls would lead to doctors leaving the state, making it harder for people to access medical care, and could result in layoffs or closures of hospitals. The California Medical Association called the proposal ""radical"" and warned that it would limit choices for consumers. Under the bill, prices would be tied to Medicare's rates, with a process for doctors or hospitals to argue for higher payments based on unique circumstances. Critics argue that the bill does not address the financial gap created by Medicare and Medicaid, as private insurers make up for the low payments from government-funded health care. The rising costs of health care in the US have led to increased premiums, deductibles, and copays for consumers, while industry consolidation has given players more power to demand higher rates. The proposal in California comes amid a larger debate in the state about government-funded insurance for all residents.

Johnson & Johnson plans to appeal the verdict, stating that they are guided by the science which supports the safety of their baby powder.\n\nAround 2,000 women across the US have filed similar lawsuits over concerns about the health damage caused by extended talcum powder use. In February, a St. Louis jury awarded $72 million to the relatives of an Alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer, and in May, another jury awarded $55 million to a South Dakota survivor of the disease. However, two cases in New Jersey were dismissed due to a lack of reliable evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer.\n\nTalc is a mineral that has been widely used in cosmetics and personal care products since 1894. While much research has found no or weak link between ovarian cancer and using baby powder, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies genital use of talc as ""possibly carcinogenic."" Attorneys handling the St. Louis cases have cited research from the 1970s that connects talcum powder to ovarian cancer, claiming that women who regularly use talc on their genital area face up to a 40 percent higher risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe law firm representing Giannecchini is working with about 1,700 additional plaintiffs and another trial is scheduled for February. The firm has accused Johnson & Johnson of marketing their product towards overweight women, blacks, and Hispanics, who are the most at-risk for ovarian cancer. However, there has been no discussion of a class-action settlement with Johnson & Johnson.\n\nGiannecchini stated that there is currently no evidence of cancer, but she won\'t know for years if she is free of the disease.

725,725,3794,Trump backs Fla. plan to import lower-cost meds from abroad.,"It’s the latest flashpoint in a confrontation between the Trump administration and the pharmaceutical industry, which for years successfully has fought off importation proposals. Drugs in other economically advanced countries are often much cheaper because governments set prices. Speaking at a White House event where he pledged to end “surprise medical bills” for patients with health insurance coverage, Trump segued to the subject of prescription drug costs. “We may allow states to buy drugs in other countries if we can buy them for a lesser price, substantially less price, and that is going to be very unique,” he declared. “But we will allow them to go to other countries because the drug companies have treated us very, very unfairly, and the rules and restrictions within our country have been absolutely atrocious.” He added that with “certain permissions” states will be able to import prescription drugs from abroad “if they can buy them for 40%, 50%, 60% less.” Trump’s comments were an obvious reference to an importation plan recently passed by the Florida legislature and expected to be signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally who made it one of his priorities. DeSantis told reporters in Florida on Thursday that he had talked with Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar this week about the plan and that the president told Azar, “You work with this governor to get it done.” Florida’s program would have to be approved by Azar’s department before it could be implemented. Under the plan, Floridians could eventually gain access to cheaper Canadian prescription drugs. Supporters say imported drugs would have to meet federal Food and Drug Administration standards and that 80 percent of drug ingredients used in the U.S. are foreign-made now. The bill overcame stiff opposition from major pharmaceutical companies and medical organizations who claimed importing drugs would lead to risks of counterfeit or ineffective substances and would be difficult for the U.S. or Florida to regulate. Some experts have been skeptical of allowing imports from Canada, partly from concerns about whether Canadian drugmakers have the capacity to supply the much larger U.S. market. But consumer groups have strongly backed the idea, arguing that it will pressure drugmakers to reduce their prices here, where government traditionally has not set such limits. AARP pushed hard for the Florida plan, saying it’s possible to safely import lower-priced, equally effective drugs and it would promote worldwide price competition. CEO Jo Ann Jenkins praised Trump for supporting the Florida legislation, calling it a “sensible drug importation plan to help reduce prescription drug costs.” The drug industry lobby, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the plan will put Floridians at risk, potentially allowing counterfeit or adulterated medications. “These proposals cannot guarantee that patients wouldn’t be put in harm’s way nor is there evidence they will save patients money,” the group said in a statement. ___ Anderson reported from Miami.",true,"In a move sure to get attention in a 2020 battleground state, President Donald Trump indicated Thursday that his administration may approve a Florida plan to import lower-cost prescription drugs from abroad for use by residents.","President Trump has expressed support for a plan in Florida that would allow the importation of lower-cost prescription drugs from other countries.

777,777,8380,Airlines rush to boost demand as coronavirus shreds playbook for crisis management.,"For now, some airlines have resorted to suspending change fees for new ticket reservations in the hope of winning over hesitant travelers until it becomes clearer where coronavirus outbreaks are localized and which routes could benefit from price drops. While lower fares have proven effective in the past in reviving demand, aviation consultant Samuel Engel said, “The pocketbook only works so far against emotion.” The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside. JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), which does not fly to Asia, was the first airline to launch free rebooking options last week, as it became clear that cases were not isolated to China. JetBlue pulled together and announced its plan in a matter of hours, President Joanna Geraghty told Reuters. “We tried to put ourselves in the shoes of our customers and think about what we would want if we were, for example, booking a spring-break trip right now,” Geraghty said. U.S. majors have since followed suit with varying waivers on change fees for new reservations to many destinations, a switch from a previous policy that covered only pre-booked flights to areas hardest-hit by the coronavirus. In Latin America, Peruvian low-cost carrier Viva Air was holding a board meeting on Wednesday to discuss measures, Declan Ryan, executive chairman of the board of directors, told Reuters. But with none of the offers so far guaranteeing money-back refunds, travelers say the policies are not enough. “I understand that there are a lot of question marks right now for the industry on how this will unfold, but I don’t feel like there’s a truly customer-friendly policy out here,” said Amanda Elman-Kolb of Chicago, who has put on hold plans for a family trip to Europe in August. Declining demand to fly abroad is not limited to U.S. travelers. International travel to the United States will fall 6% over the next three months amid coronavirus concerns, the largest decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Travel Association forecast on Tuesday. With extra widebody jets on hand after suspending flights to China, South Korea, Japan and northern Italy, major U.S. airlines are deploying them on domestic routes, a process known as upgauging. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), for example, is flying passengers from Chicago to San Francisco on a 787 Dreamliner, rather than just the usual narrowbody like a 737 or an A321. Europe’s biggest carriers warned on Tuesday that the epidemic was upsetting growth, with Ryanair (RYA.I) Chief Executive Michael O’Leary forecasting a “very deflated booking environment” for the next two to three weeks before recovering. “After Easter if things have settled down, temperatures in Europe are rising, I think there will be a significant decline in the spread of the virus. Airlines will then respond with seat promotions, seat sales that will get people back traveling very quickly,” he told Reuters. In the Asia-Pacific region, offers are under way. Malaysian budget airline AirAsia X (AIRX.KL), which was struggling financially even before coronavirus, launched a 499 ringgit ($119.09) one-year pass for unlimited trips to Australia, Japan, Korea, China and India, excluding taxes and fees on each trip - a move that CEO Benyamin Ismail called “unprecedented.” Fares are softening too on routes not directly affected by travel bans, with Australia to Los Angeles 25% lower in the three weeks ended Feb. 26 compared with the same period last year, data provided to Reuters by Skyscanner showed. In perhaps the most vivid example, Vietnam Airlines JSC HVN.HM last week said it would offer $0 round-trip fares from Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, excluding taxes and fees, to help stimulate tourism through the end of May. “Airlines have historically shown little hesitance to reduce prices to get volume,” said Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay. “One thing we know about leisure air travel demand, it can be very easily stimulated.”",true,"The rapid spread of coronavirus cases worldwide is complicating a standard strategy used by airlines when disease, disaster or conflict hit travel destinations: lower fares and redirect flights to trouble-free areas.","Airlines are taking various measures to boost demand as the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact the industry. Some airlines have suspended change fees for new ticket reservations in an attempt to attract hesitant travelers. JetBlue Airways was the first to offer free rebooking options, followed by other major US airlines. However, travelers are still unsatisfied as the policies do not guarantee money-back refunds. The US Travel Association predicts a 6% decline in international travel to the United States over the next three months, the largest decline since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. To compensate for the decline in international travel, major US airlines are deploying extra widebody jets on domestic routes. European carriers have also warned of the negative impact of the epidemic on growth. Ryanair's CEO expects a decline in the spread of the virus after Easter, leading to seat promotions and sales to stimulate travel. In the Asia-Pacific region, Malaysian budget airline AirAsia X has launched a one-year pass for unlimited trips to certain destinations. Fares on routes not directly affected by travel bans have also softened, with some routes experiencing a 25% decrease in fares compared to the same period last year. Vietnam Airlines is offering $0 round-trip fares to stimulate tourism. Analysts believe that airlines are willing to reduce prices to stimulate demand, particularly in the leisure travel sector.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

790,790,3356,Afghan capital’s air pollution may be even deadlier than war.,"At the camp for displaced people they live in, they and other families keep warm and cook by burning the garbage that surrounds them. One by one over the years, each of the children got chest infections and other maladies from the pollution and never made it to age seven, he told The Associated Press. The 60-year-old has nine surviving children. “We didn’t have enough money for the doctor and medicine ... I can barely feed my children,” said Yousuf, who works as a porter in a vegetable market earning barely a dollar a day. Like many Afghans he uses only one name. Afghanistan’s pollution may be even deadlier than its war, now 18 years long. There are no official statistics on how many Afghans die of pollution-related illnesses, but the research group State of Global Air said more than 26,000 deaths could be attributed to it in 2017. In contrast, 3,483 civilians were killed that year in the Afghan war, according to the United Nations. Kabul, a city of some 6 million, has become one of the most polluted cities in the world — ranking in the top of the list among other polluted capitals such as India’s New Delhi or China’s Beijing. Decades of war have wrecked the city’s infrastructure and caused waves of displaced people. On most days, a pall of smog and smoke lies over the city. Old vehicles pump toxins into the air, as do electrical generators using poor quality fuel. Coal, garbage, plastic and rubber are burned by poor people at home, as well as at the many brick kilns, public baths and bakeries. Many apartment buildings have no proper sanitation system, and garbage is piled on roadsides and sidewalks. The large majority of victims are poisoned by the air in their own homes, as families burn whatever they can to keep warm in Kabul’s winters, with frequent sub-zero temperatures and snow. Children and elderly are particularly vulnerable. At least 19,400 of the 2017 deaths were attributable to household pollution, which also contributed to a loss of two years and two months of life expectancy at birth, according to the State of Global Air survey. Yousuf’s camp, home to more than a hundred families, has no proper water or sanitation system and is surrounded by garbage dumps. His and other families’ children search through the garbage for paper, cloth, sticks or plastic, anything that can be burned for fuel. “We are so poor, and we have lots of problems, we don’t have enough money for medicine, wood or coal for heating, so this is our life, my children collect garbage from dump yards and we use it for cooking and heating to keep the kids warm,” he added. Decades of war have worsened the damage to Afghanistan’s environment and have made it a huge challenge to address them. Environmental issues are far down the list of priorities for a government struggling with basic security issues, rampant corruption and a plunging economy. Three or four decades ago, “it was a wish for people to come to Kabul and breath this air,” said Ezatullah Sediqi, deputy director for the National Environmental Protection Agency. But in the wars since, “we lost all our urban infrastructure for water, electricity, public transportation, green areas, all these things,” he said. Kabul’s environmental department has launched a new program to control old vehicles, one significant source of pollution. “Fighting pollution is an important as fighting terrorism,” said Mohammad Kazim Humayoun, the department’s director. Authorities warn that this winter is expected to be colder than usual and fear that will only increase the use of pollution-creating fuels to keep warm. The Kabul municipality has also called on residents to stop burning garbage for heat and instead use fuel. “If everyone follows the instructions laid out by Kabul Municipality, the pollution could be controlled,” the municipality’s spokeswoman, Nargis Mohmand, said. But if not, “then we might live with this untreatable wound for years to come.” But fuel is either too expensive or not available for many in Kabul. Electrical heaters are too pricey for most, and power outages are frequent. Doctors at Kabul’s Indira Gandhi Children’s Hospital say they’ve seen the numbers of patients with pollution-related illnesses increase, though they could not give exact figures. In the winter, hundreds of children a day sometimes come in, suffering from respiratory illnesses, according to hospital officials. Dr. Saifullah Abassin, a specialist trainer at the hospital, said his ward has a capacity of 10 patients but often has three times that number. The government has launched an environmental awareness campaign. Ads on TV, programs at schools and universities and sermons at mosques talk about pollution’s harm to society and tell listeners about steps to reduce it. But there are steps the state needs to take, like encouraging the planting of trees and creating green spaces, as well as implementing a city master plan to stop unplanned development around the capital, often a source of pollution because of their lack of services. Sediqi, of the NEPA, said that ever since the first post-Taliban government was created in 2001, there was no planning on urban infrastructure, which left individuals to build on their own. “Unfortunately, that led to unplanned development,” he said. “So now we have numerous urban problems and challenges and organizational challenges, which is causing the environmental pollution.”",true,"Yousuf fled with his family from his home in eastern Afghanistan eight years ago to escape the war, but he couldn’t escape tragedy.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer. The risk was highest for exposures before the age of 36 and increased with each additional decade of exposure before this age.

802,802,32248,"Liberals"" want to change the name of Cracker Barrel to ""Caucasian Barrel"" because otherwise it's racist.","On 8 July 2015, Change.org user Ryan Koch of Des Moines initiated a petition on that site seeking to “Change the name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel.” That petition appeared at a time of heightened racial controversy in the United States: in particular, while debate was ongoing about whether display of the Confederate flag should be retired to primarily historical contexts in the wake of a racially-motivated shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina, church on 17 June 2015. The petition facetiously suggested that the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store chain of restaurants and gift shops employed an “offensive slur” in its name: I say all of us European Americans start protesting C****er Barrel. It uses an offensive slur and it is deeply offensive and mocks our long and proud heritage. The name is offensive, their logo stereotypes European Americans as people who sit on chairs and lean against what appears to be a bourbon barrel, claiming we are all a bunch of alcoholics. Sure, they’ll SAY it’s a “cracker” barrel but everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels, they come in bags and boxes! Change the name C****er Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. After all, white people should have something to be offended by, too! The petition was popular on social media sites, where some users found it clever (and others claimed the joke as their own): I demand that Cracker Barrel immediately change its name to Caucasian Barrel because I am offended — Jamey McMahan (@jameymcmahan75) July 10, 2015 Since @Redskins name is offensive, we should change the @CrackerBarrel name next. RedskinsNation pic.twitter.com/v9rWHs61YD — David (@dpartenio) July 10, 2015 We need to change the name Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel. I find the word ‘cracker’ highly offensive. — Tyler Lovett (@DontYouLovett) July 10, 2015 The petition suggested the name “Cracker Barrel” was suspect, as “everyone knows crackers don’t come in barrels.” However, an obituary for Cracker Barrel founder Dan Evins published in the Washington Post in 2012 gave the following explanation for the chain’s nomenclature: To distinguish his station from others, he added a small restaurant and gift shop and called the outfit Cracker Barrel — a reference to old-time country stores where people played checkers atop barrels used to carry crackers and other wares. According to NPR, the pejorative term “cracker” was essentially “reclaimed” by poor white people well before the Cracker Barrel chain existed: By the early 1800s, those immigrants to the South started to refer to themselves that way as a badge of honor and a term of endearment. After his tongue-in-cheek petition garnered a good deal of attention, Ryan Koch clarified that it was not meant to be regarded as anything other than a form of satirical expression: I started this satirical petition in lieu [sic] of constant media reports of various groups and organizations constantly wanting to change things throughout the country because they claim they are offended. The petition was meant to shed light on how ridiculous all of the political correctness currently going on in the country is, and how we should focus on real issues such as crime, unemployment, veteran suicide, and corrupt politics rather than cater to everyone who feels they need to be offended. I do not in any way feel the need for, or want Cracker Barrel to change their name. I do not have any ill feelings towards the restaurant chain, and I enjoy dining at their locations frequently. I am not expecting a response from Cracker Barrel in regards to this petition, as they were not involved in the creation of it. Neither Cracker Barrel nor anyone who reads the petition should take its purpose of changing the name seriously. The petition is strictly for satirical and comedic purposes to show how ridiculous political correctness is getting in America. Cracker Barrel themselves said of the issue that: Cracker Barrel is aware of this satirical petition and recognizes that individuals have the right to express their opinion on all types of things. At Cracker Barrel, our mission is Pleasing People. While we respect the opinions of these individuals, our brand is well-known as a home away from home so we have no plans to change our name as it is synonymous with great food and great service. Thousands of people have since signed the “Change the name of Cracker Barrel to Caucasian Barrel” petition, but it doesn’t seem many (if any) considered the missive anything other than a critique of a culture that detractors feel has become too sensitive. On 15 September 2016, a web site covered the ancient nontroversy and revived the rumor that “liberals” sought to change the name of Cracker Barrel, but the petition on which that claim was based remains purely a satirical one.",false,"A Change.org petition demanding the restaurant and gift shop chain ""Cracker Barrel"" be renamed ""Caucasian Barrel"" began, and remains, satirical.","The article discusses a satirical petition that was created on Change.org in 2015, which sought to change the name of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store chain of restaurants and gift shops to ""Caucasian Barrel."" The petition claimed that the name ""Cracker Barrel"" was offensive and mocked European Americans. It suggested that white people should also have something to be offended by. The petition gained popularity on social media, with some users finding it clever and others claiming the joke as their own.

The article provides an explanation for the name ""Cracker Barrel"" from an obituary of the chain's founder, Dan Evins. It states that the name was chosen to reference old-time country stores where people played checkers atop barrels used to carry crackers and other goods. The term ""cracker"" was reclaimed by poor white people as a badge of honor and term of endearment in the early 1800s, well before the Cracker Barrel chain existed.

The creator of the satirical petition, Ryan Koch, clarified that it was meant to be a form of satirical expression and shed light on the ridiculousness of political correctness. He stated that he did not actually want Cracker Barrel to change its name and had no ill feelings towards the restaurant chain. Cracker Barrel responded to the petition, stating that they recognized individuals' right to express their opinion but had no plans to change their name.

The article concludes by mentioning that the petition gained thousands of signatures, but it seems that most people understood it as a critique of a culture that some feel has become too sensitive. It also mentions that in 2016, a website revived the rumor that ""liberals"" wanted to change the name of Cracker Barrel, but the original petition remains purely satirical.

Overall, the article highlights the satirical nature of the petition and provides context about the name ""Cracker Barrel"" and its historical connotations. It also emphasizes that the petition was not meant to be taken seriously and was intended to criticize political correctness.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial.

The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year. The cost of travel, proximity, borders, and quality of care are factors that potential medical tourists consider. In Italy and Germany, about 20 percent of adults said they would definitely consider medical tourism, possibly due to their proximity to Hungary, a popular destination for health treatments.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon.

A better news release might have commented on the potential costs (and time) required for testing a new vaccine and bringing it to market. The release mentions the antigen being studied, BD584, “was able to reduce chlamydial shedding – a symptom of C. trachomatis – by 95 per cent.” Without any context for how many people (or mice in this case) were studied, we have no way of knowing what that means. There is no mention of harms in the release. Did any of the mice die or develop sterility or pelvic inflammatory disease? This is the biggest omission in the release and truly surprising for a university. The study itself discusses in detail how the work was conducted in mice. And yet the release says nothing of the sort and, in fact, is set up in such a way that the strong impression is given that this study was conducted in humans. For example, the release says up high, “Researchers at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia. This is quickly followed by the first quote in the release, which says: “Vaccine development efforts in the past three decades have been unproductive and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans,” said Bulir, who just finished his PhD in medical sciences at McMaster. Until one read the actual study they’d have assumed that this was a human vaccine trial. All of this makes the comments about the potential benefits for human trachoma infections even more absurd. There is no disease mongering in the story. The release notes that the Canadian Institutes for Health Research funded the study. There is no other pharmacological treatment for preventing the chlamydia infection currently available. However, it might have been noted that most public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases. The release makes no mention of the fact that this vaccine is very far away from a clinical application, assuming it would even pass human trials. Instead, it talks about how easy the vaccine would be to administer and how people wouldn’t even need a lot of training to administer it. (We imagine that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training.) There’s no shortage of claims of novelty in the release, including in the headline. Although the release is misleading about the study cohort, it is a novel study given the absence of any available chlamdyia vaccines. We would say that the entire release is unjustifiable given the lack of a mention of the true nature of the study.

Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says the condition is easily treated, but if left untreated, can make it difficult for a woman to become pregnant A further complication of chlamydia is that it often carries no symptoms, so someone who is infected may not even know it. A safe and effective vaccine would certainly be of public health interest. But this research has to far to go before it will be available to the public — if ever.","Researchers at the Michael G.

The release presents the study as if it were conducted in humans, but it fails to mention the potential costs and time required for testing and bringing the vaccine to market. It also does not provide any information about the number of mice studied, making it difficult to understand the significance of the 95% reduction in chlamydial shedding.

One major omission in the release is the lack of information about any harms or adverse effects observed in the mice. The study itself discusses the details of how the work was conducted in mice, but the release does not mention this and gives the impression that the study was conducted in humans.

The release also fails to mention that there is currently no other pharmacological treatment available for preventing chlamydia infection. It could have noted that public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Furthermore, the release does not mention that the vaccine is still far away from clinical application and may not even pass human trials. Instead, it focuses on how easy the vaccine would be to administer and how little training would be required. This overlooks the fact that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training.

While the release claims novelty in the study, given the absence of any available chlamydia vaccines, it is misleading about the study cohort and fails to mention the true nature of the study. It is unclear if the investigators had the opportunity to review the release before it was published.

However, two cases in New Jersey were dismissed due to a lack of reliable evidence linking talc to ovarian cancer.\n\nTalc is a mineral that has been widely used in cosmetics and personal care products since 1894. While much research has found no or weak link between ovarian cancer and using baby powder, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies genital use of talc as ""possibly carcinogenic."" Attorneys handling the St. Louis cases have cited research from the 1970s that connects talcum powder to ovarian cancer, claiming that women who regularly use talc on their genital area face up to a 40 percent higher risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe law firm representing Giannecchini is working with about 1,700 additional plaintiffs and another trial is scheduled for February. The firm has accused Johnson & Johnson of marketing their product towards overweight women, blacks, and Hispanics, who are the most at-risk for ovarian cancer. However, there has been no discussion of a class-action settlement with Johnson & Johnson.\n\nGiannecchini stated that there is currently no evidence of cancer, but she won\'t know for years if she is free of the disease.

""I wrote to Secretary Paulson, I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, and told them this is something we have to deal with, and nobody did anything about it."" It's undisputed that Obama wrote the two officials a letter on March 22, 2007. ""There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures,"" Obama wrote. ""Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge."" ( Read the full text here .) But Obama brought up this letter in the context of explaining the current economic crisis. There's nothing to suggest in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008. His letter is concerned with people losing their homes, not a systemic threat to the economic system. (See our story and other statements on potential causes of the economic crisis here.) We also checked news clips to look at Bernanke and Paulson's public statements around the time after Obama sent his letter. • On March 28, 2007, Bernanke testified before Congress, saying, ""Although the turmoil in the subprime mortgage market has created financial problems for many individuals and families, the implications of these developments for the housing market as a whole are less clear."" • On May 15, 2007, Bernanke gave a speech in which he discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. "" We should always keep in view the enormous economic benefits that flow from a healthy and innovative financial sector,"" Bernanke said. • On May 17, 2007, Bernanke said the Federal Reserve was considering taking steps to rein in subprime lending, but would be cautious not to overregulate. ""We do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system,"" Bernanke said. • On June 20, 2007, Paulson said, ""We have had a major housing correction in this country. ... I do believe we are at or near the bottom."" So it sounds like Obama's letter didn't make much of a splash. Certainly Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells. We asked two economists, one with a right-leaning group and one with a left-leaning group, if a warning issued in 2007 could have made a difference to the problems of October 2008. Both of them said it was too late by then, because the questionable loans and securities had been issued by that point. ""The horse was already out of the barn,"" said Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ""Everyone with a brain who was paying attention knew that there were big problems associated with outstanding subprime risk,"" said Charles Calomiris, a professor at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But, he added, ""There was little that the Fed could have done after March 2007 to prevent the crisis from happening."" So Obama is right that he wrote the letter. Saying Bernanke and Paulson didn't do anything about it sounds harsh, but it is a rough approximation of what happened. But Obama's letter was largely confined to the problems of low-income homeowners who were losing their homes. It was not an early warning on the economic collapse of '08.",mixture,2007 was too late to head off the crisis,"The article discusses a claim made by Barack Obama during a presidential debate in 2008. Obama stated that he had written a letter to Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in March 2007, warning them about the potential wave of foreclosures and urging them to convene a homeownership preservation summit. The article examines the context of the letter and whether it could have predicted the economic crisis of 2008.

The letter, as quoted in the article, expresses concern about people losing their homes and calls for a summit to assess options for addressing the challenge. However, there is no indication in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008 or that he was warning about a systemic threat to the economic system.

The article then looks at public statements made by Bernanke and Paulson around the time Obama sent his letter. Bernanke testified before Congress on March 28, 2007, acknowledging the financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage market but stating that the implications for the housing market as a whole were unclear. On May 15, 2007, Bernanke discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. On May 17, 2007, Bernanke mentioned that the Federal Reserve was considering steps to rein in subprime lending but did not expect significant spillovers to the rest of the economy. Paulson, on June 20, 2007, acknowledged a major housing correction but believed the market was at or near the bottom.

The article concludes that Obama's letter did not have a significant impact, as Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells at the time. Economists interviewed for the article stated that it was too late by October 2008 to prevent the crisis, as the questionable loans and securities had already been issued. While Obama's letter addressed the problems faced by low-income homeowners, it was not an early warning of the economic collapse in 2008.

In summary, the article confirms that Obama did write a letter to Paulson and Bernanke in March 2007, expressing concern about foreclosures. However, the letter did not predict the economic crisis of 2008, and both Bernanke and Paulson did not take significant action in response to the letter.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

She tried to engage them in conversation, but the man became defensive. Fedrick discreetly left a note in one of the bathrooms, asking the girl if she needed help. The girl responded by writing on the note, ""I need help."" When the plane landed, police were waiting in the terminal and the girl was saved from the trafficker.\n\nThis story gained public attention in 2017 through a glowing NBC News account. However, some skeptics questioned the veracity of the story. The incident had not been reported until six years after it took place, and there was no independent verification of the details.

The San Francisco Airport had no record of the event, and the San Francisco Police Department did not mention any trafficking busts based on flight attendant tips in their archives.\n\nElizabeth Nolan Brown also noted that the news reports lacked detail and follow-up.

The survey also found that many seniors feel financially secure, but nearly half of low- and middle-income seniors are not confident about covering their expenses in the next five to ten years. Additionally, a third of older Americans do not believe they will be able to afford long-term care, and a major financial event would result in a fiscal crisis for one in five seniors. Lower income seniors are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses and less likely to exercise. The impact of the recession has led many seniors to continue working either full- or part-time. The majority of seniors also expressed a desire to ""age in place"" and live in their own homes for the next decade, although less than half of seniors in their 70s believed they could live independently.

Obama stated that he had written a letter to Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in March 2007, warning them about the potential wave of foreclosures and urging them to convene a homeownership preservation summit. The article examines the context of the letter and whether it could have predicted the economic crisis of 2008.\n\nThe letter, as quoted in the article, expresses concern about people losing their homes and calls for a summit to assess options for addressing the challenge. However, there is no indication in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008 or that he was warning about a systemic threat to the economic system.\n\nThe article then looks at public statements made by Bernanke and Paulson around the time Obama sent his letter. Bernanke testified before Congress on March 28, 2007, acknowledging the financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage market but stating that the implications for the housing market as a whole were unclear. On May 15, 2007, Bernanke discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. On May 17, 2007, Bernanke mentioned that the Federal Reserve was considering steps to rein in subprime lending but did not expect significant spillovers to the rest of the economy. Paulson, on June 20, 2007, acknowledged a major housing correction but believed the market was at or near the bottom.\n\nThe article concludes that Obama's letter did not have a significant impact, as Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells at the time. Economists interviewed for the article stated that it was too late by October 2008 to prevent the crisis, as the questionable loans and securities had already been issued. While Obama's letter addressed the problems faced by low-income homeowners, it was not an early warning of the economic collapse in 2008.\n\nIn summary, the article confirms that Obama did write a letter to Paulson and Bernanke in March 2007, expressing concern about foreclosures.

Barack Obama, D-Ill., reached out to the two men he blames for failing to prevent the housing and credit crisis. He is half right. He did write to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on March 22, 2007, warning about systemic risk as interest rates were about to reset. In the letter, he urged them to convene a special summit of the nation's top mortgage lenders. If action was not taken, Obama warned, we could ""find a similar scenario re-emerging that we witnessed as the meltdown in the subprime mortgage market continues to worsen."" His prediction of a spreading contagion is a debatable point among economists. ""However, to lay at its feet his impeccable foresight about the credit markets and the anchoring housing market is a stretch,"" the article states. The picture Obama paints about being scorned by Bernanke and Paulson regarding a dire assessment of the economy is also fuzzy. This is because when his letter was sent, both men were conceding issues with the underbelly of the mortgage market. Although Bernanke and Paulson did not share his recommendation for a summit, they were in lockstep on his notion that things were souring and critical action would be necessary down the road.

946,946,29482,"SUNY Binghamton is offering a ""Stop White People"" course.","On 25 August 2016, multiple Fox News-linked accounts published tweets and articles about a school “training course” that led many social media users to believe was a class offered at the State University of New York at Binghamton (commonly known as Binghamton University) called “Stop White People.” Columnist Todd Starnes penned a column about the controversy, describing a “workshop” offered as “an official part of the residential assistant training program”: Nothing screams tolerance and diversity like a university workshop designed to target white people. The State University of New York in Binghamton has a bit of explaining to do after they held a workshop titled, “#StopWhitePeople2K16.” The workshop was an official part of the residential assistant training program at the taxpayer-funded university. The Binghamton Review, the university’s conservative newspaper, exposed this nonsense and they deserve a round of applause for their efforts. Starnes referenced a 24 August 2016 item published by student newspaper the Binghamton Review that included additional detail about the teacup tempest, but the latter was far clearer about the minute scope and origin of the printed material (depicted above) that prompted the rumors: On Friday, August 12, an optional conference for Binghamton University Residential Assistants entitled “#StopWhitePeople2K16” was held in an effort to “take the next step in understanding diversity, privilege, and the society we function within.” Naturally, that title garnered a significant amount of attention in a very short period of time, and before long, the University delivered an official response to concerns from those who believed the title was racist. Brian Rose, Binghamton University’s Vice President of Student Affairs, wrote in his response to the controversy that the program was not “anti-white,” and instead was simply a “discussion” that “explored reverse racism, the relationship of communities of color with police, whiteness, crime and segregation in an open conversation format.” Rose also wrote that the titular hashtag “is commonly used ironically,” and “as the senior student affairs officer on campus,” he is “supportive of the students’ efforts to facilitate dialogue around a challenging set of topics.” Rose indeed issued an undated statement about an optional 12 August 2016 event for resident advisors (RAs) at Binghamton, during which three RAs hosted the presentation described in the printed material. Rose noted that the presentation in question centered on race relations and referenced a popular existing Twitter hashtag that was not created by Binghamton RAs: A program facilitated by three student resident advisors (RA’s) as part of an educational program for RA staff training has prompted public and internal comment and inquiry. The program title “#StopWhitePeople2K16” was drawn from a familiar hashtag in use on Twitter, and was not invented by the program facilitators. It is my understanding that the hashtag is commonly used ironically. The optional program was developed by the students themselves, supported by a young professional staff person. Its purpose, as conceived, was to facilitate a discussion among the RA’s that would improve their ability to handle conflicts among residents around issues of diversity. Upon learning of the concerns expressed over the session’s title by some off-campus groups and individuals, the university’s student-affairs office reviewed the session and the program content more closely to obtain an accurate understanding. We verified that the actual program content was not “anti-white”. The inclusion of the program in the educational session was not driven by any university administration initiative to advocate any specific viewpoint on diversity. About 40-50 RA’s chose to attend the session which ran concurrently with some other sessions. Topically the discussion in the program was far-ranging, student driven and explored reverse racism, the relationship of communities of color with police, whiteness, crime and segregation in an open conversation format. Post session feedback predominantly described the session as a respectful and productive conversation. Professional staff followed up directly with a few participants who had a mixed reaction to the program in support of those participants. What we strive to do from an administrative level is cultivate an environment where our students listen to one another, learn from one another and do so in a manner that doesn’t cause unnecessary harm. I have no indication that this particular program was inconsistent with the respectful environment we hope to support and sustain. Nevertheless, rumors quickly spread on social media indicating that Binghamton was offering a full course in their curriculum called “Stop White People,” and a number of web sites and online users reacted to that misinterpretation. We contacted the university’s media relations department and a representative with whom we spoke reiterated that the RA-only presentation was student-led and student-managed, adding that Binghamton at no time has offered a “Stop White People” class as part of any school curriculum.",false,"What's true: Some Binghamton University resident assistants (RAs) utilized material with the words ""stop white people,"" inspired by a popular Twitter hashtag, for use during an optional RA program developed by students.

Brian Rose, Binghamton University's Vice President of Student Affairs, responded to the controversy by stating that the program was not ""anti-white"" but rather a discussion exploring topics such as reverse racism, the relationship between communities of color and police, whiteness, crime, and segregation. Rose explained that the title of the conference was drawn from a popular Twitter hashtag and was not invented by the program facilitators. He also mentioned that the program was student-led and supported by a young professional staff person.

Despite rumors spreading on social media that Binghamton was offering a full course called ""Stop White People,"" the university's media relations department clarified that the RA-only presentation was student-led and managed. Binghamton has never offered a ""Stop White People"" class as part of its curriculum.

948,948,840,U.N. flags need to cut meat to curb land use impact on global warming.,"Although the report stopped short of explicitly advocating going meat free, it called for big changes to farming and eating habits to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on stretched land and water resources. Plant-based foods and sustainable animal-sourced food could free up several million square kilometers of land by 2050 and cut 0.7-8.0 gigatonnes a year of carbon dioxide equivalent, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said. “There are certain kinds of diets that have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land,” Jim Skea, professor at London’s Imperial College, said on Thursday. The IPCC met this week in Geneva, Switzerland to finalize its report which should help to guide governments meeting this year in Chile on ways to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. “The IPCC does not recommend people’s diets ... Dietary choices are very often shaped or influenced by local production practices and cultural habits,” Skea, who is one of the report’s authors, told reporters in Geneva. Land can be both a source and sink of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming, and better land management can help to tackle climate change, the IPCC said. But it is not the only solution and cutting emissions from all sectors is essential to quickly curtail global warming. “The window for making these changes is closing fast. If there is further delay in reducing emissions, we will miss the opportunity to successfully manage the climate change transition in the land sector,” it said. Since the pre-industrial era, land surface air temperature has risen by 1.53 degrees Celsius, twice as much as the global average temperature (0.87C), causing more heatwaves, droughts and heavy rain, as well as land degradation and desertification. Human use directly affects more than 70% of the global, ice-free land surface and agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use, the IPCC added in the report. Agriculture, forestry and other land use activities accounted for 23% of total net man-made greenhouse gas emissions during 2007-2016. When pre- and post-production activity in the food system are included, that rises to up to 37%. Last year the IPCC’s first special report warned that keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), rather than the 2C target agreed under the Paris accord, required rapid change across society. The IPCC warned of more disruption to global food chains as extreme weather becomes more frequent due to climate change and said environmental costs should be factored into food. It projects a median increase of 7.6% in cereal prices by 2050, meaning higher food prices and an increased risk of hunger. While an estimated 821 million people are undernourished, changing consumption habits have already contributed to about 2 billion adults being overweight or obese. Per capita supply of vegetable oils and meat has more than doubled based on data since 1961 but 25-30% of total food produced is still lost or wasted. Yields of crops such as maize and wheat have declined in some regions, while those of maize, wheat and sugar beets have increased in others in recent decades. While forests can soak up heat-trapping gases from the atmosphere, desertification and deforestation can amplify warming due to the loss of vegetation cover and soil erosion. Measures to cut emissions, such as the production of biofuels, biochar - made from biomass - as well as planting trees, will also increase demand for land conversion. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation could result in a reduction of 0.4-5.8 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent, the report said. The Amazon, about 60% of which lies in Brazil, is sometimes called the “lungs of the world” due to the amount of CO2 it can absorb but it was not directly mentioned in the IPCC’s summary for policymakers. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has supported opening up protected areas of the world’s largest tropical rainforest to facilitate agriculture and mining since taking office in January. The report text is prepared by over 100 scientists but has to be approved by governments. In those discussions, Brazil and India were very active to protect their national agro-industrial interests, a source familiar with the talks said.",true,"Global meat consumption must fall to curb global warming, reduce growing strains on land and water and improve food security, health and biodiversity, a United Nations report on the effects of climate change concluded.","The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report calling for significant changes to farming and eating habits in order to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on land and water resources.

The report emphasizes that certain diets have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land.

971,971,10748,"Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","No dollar signs here, which — as we discovered — is quite an oversight, given the steep costs of adalimumab. Prednisone costs about $0.33 per mg, and chronic uveitis patients take anywhere from 10 mg to 60 mg per day. Looking at the minimum number (which patients are usually tapered to 6 months into their treatment), that’s a cost of more than $1,190 a year. In comparison, the name-brand of adalimumab, Humira, costs about $54.49 per mg. In the study, patients received adalimumab on a bi-weekly basis, receiving some 1,640 mg of the drug over 80 weeks if they didn’t drop out. That adds up to a total of $89,400 — an average of $58,000 per year or $1,120 per week. The benefits are well-represented in the release, and so is their context. By working adalimumab into the standard treatment, most of the key measurements of uveitis are held in check for nearly twice as long in a typical patient — 24 weeks instead of 13 weeks. This represents improvement — but not a cure — for a chronic disease. The harms covered in the study were glossed over in the release, in particular by this sentence: “[P]atients in the adalimumab group reported serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, more frequently than those in the placebo group.” Given what was left out, we’ll mark this one unsatisfactory. What’s not mentioned is that 16% patients in the adalimumab group dropped out compared to less than 7% in the placebo group. We also learned that some of the adverse events that triggered dropout weren’t included in the release: “Adverse events leading to discontinuation of participation in the trial were more common in the adalimumab group and included choroidal neovascularization, blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, fatigue, malaise, and suicidal ideation.” Something simple that the release could have characterized about the adalimumab treatment’s harms, but didn’t: it had three times the rate of “adverse events” and twice as many serious adverse events. Including any of these numbers — and some of the harms that taking corticosterids like prednisone can cause (the best we get is “many unwanted side effects”) — would have put the harms and benefits of the adalimumab treatment into clearer context. This is perhaps the greatest strength of the release. It not only clearly explains the reasons for the drug trial and the metrics of measurement, but also the activity through which the drug might work. The report involves a randomized controlled trial, so a strong evidence level is expected, and the release did note the industry sponsorship. It’s well known that studies sponsored by industry report favorable results more frequently, which makes some sense, in that companies wouldn’t test drugs they didn’t have strong preliminary evidence for. But it’s also possible that industry sponsorship can bias the conduct and reporting of such studies to make a positive outcome more likely. We couldn’t find anything that would scare a reader. In fact, the release perhaps went a little too far to the other end of the spectrum and didn’t mention the word “blindness” once, which is a possible outcome of uveitis if left untreated. The release dedicates a whole paragraph to summarizing potential conflicts of interest, which is welcome and we hope to see this kind of transparency showing up in more releases in the future. It further directs readers to the published study’s supplementary documents for more extensive disclosure information. In the PDF of supplementary materials we learned that only two out of the 17 authors had no conflicts of interest to declare. Although the release mentions the weakness of corticosteroids in uveitis treatment, it doesn’t go far enough in explaining how steroids compare with adalimumab, even though steroids were given to the patients concurrently with adalimumab in “diminishing doses” throughout the trial. It’s worth noting, especially for comparison with adalimumab, how the long-term use of corticosteroid drugs work against uveitis symptoms by suppressing the body’s entire immune system — and, as a side effect, metabolism — not just one specific target of inflammation. Humira also suppresses the body’s immune system although through a different mechanism. The level of detail is good here, noting that the FDA recently approved adalimumab for noninfectious uveitis, how it was previously approved for other conditions, and in which types of uveitis it’s generally ok to treat. The novelty is somewhat nuanced, but explained well enough: Uveitis is a bag full of symptoms, and the damage involved can span across the entire eye. By measuring how it affected the most frequent symptoms, “the study’s results broaden the applicability of treatment for patients” and possibly help lead to longer-term solutions for uveitis. We didn’t see anything that’s cause for alarm.",true,"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.","The article discusses a study on the effectiveness of adalimumab (brand name Humira) as a treatment for chronic uveitis, a type of eye inflammation. The study found that adalimumab, when added to the standard treatment, improved the symptoms of uveitis and extended the time between flare-ups from 13 weeks to 24 weeks. However, the article highlights some important information that was not mentioned in the study's release. It states that patients in the adalimumab group reported more serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, compared to the placebo group. Additionally, 16% of patients in the adalimumab group dropped out of the study, compared to less than 7% in the placebo group. The article also notes that adalimumab had three times the rate of adverse events and twice as many serious adverse events compared to the placebo. The release of the study did not mention the word ""blindness,"" which is a possible outcome of untreated uveitis. The article praises the release for its transparency in disclosing potential conflicts of interest and directing readers to supplementary documents for more information. However, it criticizes the release for not providing enough information on how adalimumab compares to corticosteroids, which are commonly used to treat uveitis. The article explains that corticosteroids suppress the body's entire immune system, while adalimumab targets specific inflammation. The article concludes by stating that there is no cause for alarm in the study's findings.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

1036,1036,11043,Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery,"The story makes no mention of costs, even though the costs of statins are easy to find, and, in Canada, because of the universal health care system, the costs of statins to the government should be an easy number to quantify. All benefits are presented in relative terms, which is misleading to readers. For example, the third sentence says, “Researchers found that people who took statin medications had about a 16% reduced risk of renal failure and a 21% lower risk of dying after their surgeries, compared to people who weren’t taking the drugs.” What are the absolute numbers? Well, out of 67,941 people, 1,208 people suffered an acute kidney injury while not taking statins, and 1,039 suffered one while taking statins. That means 169 fewer people suffered an acute kidney injury, and this is making the big assumption that statins had anything to do with it. No risks or harms from statins are mentioned in this story. Statins are a well tolerated class of drugs with a relatively low risk profile, but all drugs carry risks and have side effects. When you start talking about extending statin use to a much larger percentage of the population, those risks become magnified. We felt that some mention of risks was warranted. There is some good information in here about the basic outlines of the study design. The story says, for example, “For the study, researchers looked at the medical records of all seniors who had elective surgery in Ontario, Canada, from 1995 through 2008, a group of 213,347 men and women over age 65. Elective procedures included heart or lung operations, vascular surgery, or surgery in the abdomen, or procedures on the bladder, ureter, or kidneys — except transplants or removal of the kidneys. About half of patients in the study had heart surgeries. Nearly one-third of these patients were taking statin medications before going under the knife.” What was missing was any sense of the limitation of these findings. The study itself goes on at some length about these limitations, including this crucial piece of information: “As with all observational studies, the protective association seen between statin use and AKI may not be causal.” We also thought it worth noting that to be considered a “statin user,” all one had to do was fill a statin prescription in the previous 90 days. Given that someone could have filled a statin prescription on Monday and had surgery on Friday, we don’t think this is a strong enough basis to prove that statins protected kidneys from failing. We don’t think the story intended to engage in disease-mongering, but the story is framed in such a way that the risk of renal failure following surgery is overly hyped. The second sentence of the story says, “For reasons doctors don’t completely understand, this complication, which is called acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure, is on the rise, and it dramatically increases a patient’s risk of dying during recovery.” It isn’t until later in the story that we are told, “Overall, about 2% of patients experienced renal failure within two weeks of their procedures.” That should ease patients’ concerns a bit until later in the story it says, “Depending on how researchers define it, studies have shown that it may occur in up to 40% of patients.” This sort of whipsawing can turn readers off to a topic and leave them feeling scared and confused. There are no independent sources quoted in this story. There was nothing in the story about current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This leads readers to believe that there is nothing they can do to prevent a renal injury or death other than take statins. Statins are such a widely prescribed class of drug that we feel most readers will understand their availability. The story does hint at this by noting that one-third of the patients who had surgery in this study were taking statins. The story, like the study, points out that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals. We think the story makes it clear to readers that what’s new and important here is showing a relationship in humans as well. The story does not rely solely on a news release, but we do think the story relied too heavily on the study’s abstract. It should have gone deeper into the story to provide readers context.",false,"The story could have benefited from some strong, independent voices commenting on the findings and from a more careful explanation of the study itself. Readers deserved to know more about the study’s limitations, about the absolute differences seen in the groups studied and about the risks associated with statin use. The story went beyond the press release used to promote the study, but it needed to go much further in helping readers understand the strength of the findings and their potential impact on readers considering surgery. One of the risks associated with surgery is kidney failure, an outcome no patient or surgeon wants. To be able to reduce that risk by taking a pill would be a major boon to medicine. This study hints that statins could provide that benefit, but, as the authors themselves acknowledge, there are significant limitations to a backward-looking, uncontrolled study. Those limitations and the reality of the necessary steps to create a foundation for solid clinical practice needed to be acknowledged in this story and other coverage of the same topic.","The article titled ""Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery"" discusses a study that suggests statin medications may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after surgery. The study, conducted in Ontario, Canada, analyzed the medical records of over 200,000 seniors who had elective surgery between 1995 and 2008. It found that patients who took statins had a 16% reduced risk of renal failure and a 21% lower risk of dying after surgery compared to those who did not take the drugs.

However, the article fails to mention the costs of statins, which are easily accessible, and the fact that in Canada, where the study was conducted, the costs of statins to the government should be quantifiable due to the universal healthcare system. The benefits of statins are presented in relative terms, which can be misleading to readers. The article provides absolute numbers, stating that out of 67,941 people, 1,208 suffered acute kidney injury without taking statins, while 1,039 suffered it while taking statins. This means that 169 fewer people suffered acute kidney injury while taking statins, assuming that statins had any effect. The article also fails to mention any risks or harms associated with statins, which is important when considering the potential extension of statin use to a larger population.

The study design is briefly outlined in the article, mentioning that it analyzed the medical records of seniors who had elective surgery. However, the article does not discuss the limitations of the study, including the fact that the observed association between statin use and AKI may not be causal. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a ""statin user"" were simply filling a statin prescription in the previous 90 days, which may not be a strong enough basis to prove that statins protect kidneys from failing.

The article also highlights the rise of AKI after surgery and its increased risk of patient death. However, it fails to provide a balanced perspective by stating that only about 2% of patients experience renal failure within two weeks of their procedures. The article also mentions that depending on how researchers define it, AKI may occur in up to 40% of patients, which can be confusing and alarming to readers.

The article does not include any independent sources and does not discuss current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This may lead readers to believe that taking statins is the only way to prevent renal injury or death. While the article acknowledges that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals, it emphasizes the importance of showing this relationship in humans as well.

Overall, the article relies heavily on the study's abstract and lacks deeper context. It does not address the costs or risks of statins, fails to provide a balanced perspective on the risk of renal failure after surgery, and does not discuss alternative treatment approaches.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The article also fails to mention any risks or harms associated with statins, which is important when considering the potential extension of statin use to a larger population.\n\nThe study design is briefly outlined in the article, mentioning that it analyzed the medical records of seniors who had elective surgery. However, the article does not discuss the limitations of the study, including the fact that the observed association between statin use and AKI may not be causal. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a ""statin user"" were simply filling a statin prescription in the previous 90 days, which may not be a strong enough basis to prove that statins protect kidneys from failing.\n\nThe article also highlights the rise of AKI after surgery and its increased risk of patient death. However, it fails to provide a balanced perspective by stating that only about 2% of patients experience renal failure within two weeks of their procedures. The article also mentions that depending on how researchers define it, AKI may occur in up to 40% of patients, which can be confusing and alarming to readers.\n\nThe article does not include any independent sources and does not discuss current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This may lead readers to believe that taking statins is the only way to prevent renal injury or death. While the article acknowledges that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals, it emphasizes the importance of showing this relationship in humans as well.\n\nOverall, the article relies heavily on the study\'s abstract and lacks deeper context.

While there was a correlation found between reduced rates of acute renal injury and statin use among surgery patients, it’s also correct that the findings were not causal and will need more research. It would have been helpful if the story had cautioned that, as with many drugs, there are potential side effects that patients and healthcare providers should consider in discussions about starting a new medication. What is missed in the story is any cost of statins and also no mention of other methods (than medication) of reducing risk of renal injury after surgery. It’s mostly an echo of a press release although some additional context from American sources was included."

REUTERS/Fred Prouser There has been speculation about the fate of the boy king, who died sometime around 1324 BC probably at age 19, since the 1922 discovery of his intact tomb in Egypt’s Valley of Kings. Tests performed on 16 royal mummies found four, including Tut, had contracted a severe form of malaria that likely cut short Tut’s reign — ruling out murder or some other sickness. Scientists from Egypt, Germany and elsewhere, including Zahi Hawass of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, compiled results from genetic and radiological testing performed on the mummies between 2007 and 2009. The results clarify details about the 155-year-long 18th Dynasty that included Tutankhamen, who inherited the throne at age 11. The scientists speculated Tut was weakened by a broken leg possibly from a fall. That and a malaria infection led to his death, they believe. Tut was afflicted with a cleft palate, mild clubfoot in his left foot and other bone ailments. He and some family members had a form of Kohler disease, which can cause foot bones to collapse from lack of blood but would not have been fatal. “Tutankhamen had multiple disorders, and some of them might have reached the cumulative character of an inflammatory, immune-suppressive — and thus weakening — syndrome. He might be envisioned as a young but frail king who needed canes to walk,” Hawass wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Besides the priceless gold artifacts found in Tut’s tomb, he was also equipped for the afterlife with some 130 canes and staves — some with signs of wear — and a veritable pharmacy. The scientists were also fairly certain they identified the mummies belonging to Tut’s father, Akhenaten, and his grandmother, Tiye, based on shared blood groups. They shot down speculation that Tut and his forebears had severe abnormalities, ruling out Marfan syndrome and another condition that could have led to enlarged breasts. “It is unlikely that either Tutankhamen or Akhenaten actually displayed a significantly bizarre or feminine physique. It is important to note that ancient Egyptian kings typically had themselves and their families represented in an idealized fashion,” Hawass wrote.",true,"King Tutankhamen, the teen-aged pharaoh whose Egyptian tomb yielded dazzling treasures, limped around on tender bones and a club foot and probably died from malaria, researchers said on Tuesday.","The article discusses the results of genetic and radiological testing performed on the mummies of King Tutankhamen and other members of his family. The tests were conducted between 2007 and 2009 by scientists from Egypt, Germany, and other countries. The results provide new insights into the life and death of King Tut.

The testing revealed that King Tut had contracted a severe form of malaria, which likely contributed to his death. This finding rules out the possibility of murder or another sickness as the cause of his death. The scientists also speculate that Tut was weakened by a broken leg, possibly from a fall. In addition to malaria and the broken leg, Tut had other health issues, including a cleft palate, mild clubfoot in his left foot, and other bone ailments. He and some family members also had a form of Kohler disease, which can cause foot bones to collapse but is not fatal.

The scientists believe that Tutankhamen had multiple disorders that may have weakened his immune system. They describe him as a young but frail king who needed canes to walk. In Tut's tomb, along with priceless gold artifacts, around 130 canes and staves were found, some of which showed signs of wear. This suggests that Tut relied on these walking aids.

The study also identified the mummies belonging to Tut's father, Akhenaten, and his grandmother, Tiye, based on shared blood groups. The scientists debunked speculation that Tut and his ancestors had severe abnormalities, ruling out conditions like Marfan syndrome and another condition that could have led to enlarged breasts. They explain that ancient Egyptian kings were typically represented in an idealized fashion, so it is unlikely that Tut or Akhenaten had significantly bizarre or feminine physiques.

Overall, the study provides important information about the 18th Dynasty, which lasted for 155 years and included Tutankhamen. It sheds light on Tut's health issues and the circumstances surrounding his death. The findings suggest that Tut's reign was cut short due to a combination of malaria and a weakened immune system caused by multiple disorders.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal.

1128,1128,24740,"The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year.","Taxpayers may have been shocked to learn from House Republicans that President Barack Obama wants to pay for health care by charging them to turn on a light. ""The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year,"" the House Republican Conference said in a Web post and press release titled ""Questions on the Budget for President Obama,"" distributed March 24. ""What effect will this have on Americans struggling to pay their mortgages?"" it asked. This alleged ""light switch tax"" is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, and allow companies to trade emissions credits among themselves. That's called a cap-and-trade program, and Republicans say the companies would just pass the tax on to electricity consumers. So any revenue raised by a cap-and-trade program amounts to a ""light switch tax"" on consumers, the House Republicans alleged. To back up the claim, their staff pointed us to an M.I.T. report that says a similar a cap-and-trade proposal (the administration has not yet detailed their own version) would raise $366 billion per year. If you divide that by the 117 million households in the United States, you find it would cost each household $3,128, they said. But is it that simple? Can you just assume consumers would be out $366 billion since that's how much the program would raise from fuel companies? No. ""It's just wrong,"" said John Reilly, an energy, environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report. ""It's wrong in so many ways it's hard to begin."" Not only is it wrong, but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him. ""Someone from the House Republicans had called me (March 20) and asked about this,"" Reilly said. ""I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it, but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time."" It continues to float. That's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal, Reilly said. The tax might push the price of carbon-based fuels up a bit, but other results of a cap-and-trade program, such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources, would put downward pressure on prices. Moreover, consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form. The report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals, called the ""welfare"" cost. It would be $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people. The cost would grow over time as the program ramps up, but the average annual cost over time in today's dollars — that is, the ""average annual net present value cost"" — is still just $85 per person, Reilly said. That would be $215.05 per household. A far cry from $3,128. And that isn't the only inaccuracy in the claim. The Republican press release said the cap-and-trade program would pay for ""nationalized health care."" But Obama's health care proposal is not for ""nationalized health care."" It does call for a ""National Health Insurance Exchange"" with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress — but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want, as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign. Even if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care, he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap-and-trade program as the Republicans alleged. Rather, his $634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers, according to Obama's proposed budget. The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap-and-trade program would pay for ""increased spending"" rather than health care. But it still calls cap-and-trade a ""light switch tax"" and claims the whole cost would come from consumers. If the Republicans had simply misstated the results of the MIT study, the Truth-O-Meter would have been content giving this one a False. But for them to keep repeating the claim after the author of the study told them it was wrong means we have to set the meter ablaze. . Update, May 6, 2009 Two days after we published this item, Reilly sent a letter to Rep. John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House, complaining that his study ""has been misrepresented in recent press releases distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The press release claims our report estimates an average cost per family of a carbon cap and trade program that would meet targets now being discussed in Congress to be over $3,000, but that is nearly 10 times the correct estimate, which is approximately $340."" (The $340 is a cost per family of four, comparable to the $215 we used as the cost per household of 2.56 people.) Reilly said it was ""simplistic and misleading"" to interpret the statistics the way the Republicans did because the administration's cap and trade proposal has ""been designed to offset the energy cost impacts on middle and lower income households."" A day later Boehner responded with a statement that insisted $3,128 was accurate. ""In reality, it would be a tax of up to $3,100 per family on every American family that drives a car, buys products manufactured in the United States, or flips on a light switch,"" Boehner said in the statement. On April 22, the conservative Weekly Standard came to the defense of the Republicans and published an article that said Reilly had erred in calculating the cost. It said that Reilly had since corrected the figure from the original $340 to $800. The article by John McCormack, an editorial assistant at the publication, said that even with the corrected figure, Reilly was ""still low-balling the cost of cap and trade by using some fuzzy logic. In reality, cap and trade could cost the average household more than $3,900 per year."" The Weekly Standard noted that Obama plans to use some of the cap-and-trade revenues to fund his ""making work pay"" tax credit of $400 per individual and $800 per family per year but then did not reflect that plan in the ultimate cost to households. It said there was no proof that Reilly is correct to assume that ""the $3,128 will be 'returned' to each household."" The article also said that our PolitiFact item was incorrect because we relied on Reilly's numbers. Several PolitiFact readers who apparently believe that Reilly's corrected figure means the Republicans are now accurate, wrote to us and urged us to publish a correction. So we have revisited the numbers to provide this update. First, we should emphasize that our original item was simple and straightforward. The Republicans said their claim was based on the MIT study. But Reilly, the author of that study, said the Republicans were misrepresenting his work. And not only that, he said he'd told them they were misrepresenting his work before they made the claim, and they made the claim anyway. That struck us as an egregious falsehood. And it's important to recognize that our rating was on the overall statement that, ""The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."" The first part of that statement about nationalized health care is completely false. The Obama administration is not proposing nationalized health care, a phrase we believe is meant to invoke fears of socialized medicine. Yet Republicans have repeatedly made that inaccurate claim. So that part of the claim was and remains ridiculously false. Now, in light of Reilly's revised number and Boehner's refusal to change what he says, let's reconsider the second part of the claim, that the Obama administration is proposing ""a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."" First, calling it a light switch tax remains incorrect. That implies that it is a federal tax levied on consumers when in fact it is an extrapolation of the per-family burden of a new federal charge that would be levied on energy companies. To say it ""would cost every American household $3,128 a year"" suggests tremendous precision. But we have found virtually no precision about anything to do with the cap and trade proposals because they are still very much just in the talking stages. Indeed, the House Democratic version is known as the ""discussion draft"" and, although there are some broad concepts, key details about how the program would work, its ultimate cost and how Americans would be reimbursed for higher energy costs are still far from final. But, given Reilly's corrected number, is it now accurate to say it will cost every household $3,128 a year? No, it's not. As we said in our original item, Reilly's analysis has produced two different ways to measure the cost of a cap and trade system. One way is the total estimate of federal revenues from a cap and trade auction, which indeed works out to $3,128 per family in the United States. That's the amount of money the energy companies would have to pay the federal government, and presumably the companies would pass those costs to consumers through higher prices. The issue then becomes whether or not the Obama administration intends to offset that cost to families. Republicans take the position, which was echoed by the Weekly Standard, that the Obama administration has no such plans. Reilly says the administration does. Who's right? Of course, we can't really know what the administration intends to do, but the available record makes it pretty clear that the White House has made plans to return to families the money the cap and trade program might cost them in energy bills. Some of it -- $400 per year for individuals, $800 for families -- would go directly back to families through the ""making work pay"" tax credit totalling $65 billion per year, according to the Obama budget proposal . An additional $15 billion per year would benefit them indirectly through research and development on clean energy technologies. And the budget specifies that ""all additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public."" That backs up Reilly's claim that the $3,128 is effectively returned to people. The second way to look at the cost of cap and trade is through the impact the proposal would have on the overall economy -- the extent to which the new system would constrain the economy and slow its growth. That's the source of Reilly's $340 number, which he has corrected to $800. That number is still far short of the very precise $3,128 the Republicans have been using. And Republican leaders continue to toss around the $3,100 number, often with no caveats or qualifiers -- or mention of the $800. We called Reilly to get his reaction to the article in the Weekly Standard and the Republicans' latest claim . He said the Weekly Standard editorial assistant who wrote the story ""just completely twisted the whole thing."" He said his correction to the $800 figure didn't substantially improve the accuracy of what the Republicans are contending. Their claim ""is a misrepresentation. They are basing (the $3,128) on our study and that is an incorrect use of our study. It's false."" Here at PolitiFact, we're sure there will be plenty of other claims in the next few months that will allow us to further examine the cost of a cap and trade proposal. This claim has centered on Reilly's two-year-old study, but other studies have been done more recently and will soon be in the political mix. But for now, this claim remains a serious distortion in many ways. It is a ridiculous falsehood to say the money is being used ""for nationalized health care."" It is inaccurate to call it a ""light switch tax."" And it is incorrect to cite a precise ""tax"" of $3,128 -- with no caveats or qualifiers -- when the Obama administration has specified how the money would be returned to people. Given Reilly's comments that they are using his numbers improperly, we see nothing to change our conclusion. So our original ruling stands: . - Bill Adair, PolitiFact Editor",false,"GOP full of hot air about Obama's ""light switch tax""","The claim that the Obama administration wants to pay for nationalized health care through a ""light switch tax"" is false. The tax in question is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, which Republicans argue would be passed on to consumers. However, economists have stated that this claim is incorrect and that the cost to consumers would be much lower. The MIT report cited by House Republicans estimated a net cost to individuals of $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family. The average annual cost over time in today's dollars is estimated to be $85 per person or $215.05 per household. This is a far cry from the $3,128 claimed by House Republicans. 

Furthermore, the claim that the cap-and-trade program would pay for nationalized health care is also false. Obama's health care proposal does not involve nationalizing health care, and the funding for health care reform would come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers. The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their statement to say that the cap-and-trade program would pay for ""increased spending"" rather than health care. However, they still refer to it as a ""light switch tax"" and claim that the entire cost would come from consumers.

The article concludes that the claim is a serious distortion in many ways. It is false to say that the money is being used for nationalized health care, inaccurate to call it a ""light switch tax,"" and incorrect to cite a precise tax of $3,128 without mentioning how the money would be returned to consumers. Economists have stated that the cost to consumers would be much lower than claimed by House Republicans. Therefore, the claim is deemed false.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

1137,1137,34442,Policies that legalize recreational marijuana exacerbate America’s opioid addiction epidemic.,"On 23 February 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, in response to a question about the Trump Administration’s policy regarding states that have legalized marijuana in defiance of federal law, suggested that there would likely be greater enforcement of recreational cannabis in coming years. To defend this claim, he cited America’s opioid addiction crisis as a reason the government should not “encourage” people to do drugs: There’s a big difference between [medical] and recreational marijuana. And I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people. There’s still a federal law that we need to abide by when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature. Implicit in this statement is the claim that recreational marijuana will lead individuals to other, harder drugs, in this case a class of prescription painkillers called opioids that are closely related to heroin. That the United States is suffering through a serious crisis with opioid addiction and overdose is well accepted by the federal government. From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Drug overdose deaths and opioid-involved deaths continue to increase in the United States. The majority of drug overdose deaths (more than six out of ten) involve an opioid. Since 1999, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids (including prescription opioids and heroin) quadrupled. From 2000 to 2015 more than half a million people died from drug overdoses. 91 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose. We now know that overdoses from prescription opioids are a driving factor in the 15-year increase in opioid overdose deaths. Since 1999, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. nearly quadrupled, yet there has not been an overall change in the amount of pain that Americans report. Deaths from prescription opioids — drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone — have more than quadrupled since 1999. While these drugs can be both addictive and deadly in their own right, numerous studies have demonstrated an association between non-medical (i.e. recreational) prescription drug use and illicit drug use such as heroin, which has similar chemical properties to opioids: From 2002–2013, past month heroin use, past year heroin use, and heroin addiction have all increased among 18-25 year olds. The number of people who started to use heroin in the past year is also trending up. Among new heroin users, approximately three out of four report abusing prescription opioids prior to using heroin. The cause of this epidemic is not controversial — researchers almost universally attribute it to legal prescriptions from medical doctors that are either used by a patient legally, or illicitly diverted from a doctor to another individual. A 2016 review in the New England Journal of Medicine is unequivocal on this point: Two major facts can no longer be questioned. First, opioid analgesics are widely diverted and improperly used, and the widespread use of the drugs has resulted in a national epidemic of opioid overdose deaths and addictions. More than a third (37%) of the 44,000 drug-overdose deaths that were reported in 2013 (the most recent year for which estimates are available) were attributable to pharmaceutical opioids; heroin accounted for an additional 19%. At the same time, there has been a parallel increase in the rate of opioid addiction, affecting approximately 2.5 million adults in 2014. Second, the major source of diverted opioids is physician prescriptions. The increase in opioid painkillers prescriptions stems, most argue, from an increased demand for better pain medication in the early 1990s, a campaign that misrepresented their danger, and heavy marketing and drug development by pharmaceutical companies. Liberalization of cannabis policy, one will note, is not mentioned as a driving force behind the opioid crisis. Perhaps just as pernicious as the falsehood implicit in Spicer’s press conference regarding the potential link between cannabis and opioids is his omission (or ignorance) of the fact that studies increasingly suggest that cannabis legalization results in a reduction of opioid overdoses. The most exhaustive study on this topic, published in JAMA Internal Medicine in October 2014, analyzed the cause of death data from all states between 1999 and 2010, including states that had legalized medical marijuana during that period. These researchers found that states with medical marijuana programs had fewer opioid related deaths, and that these decreases happened in concert with marijuana reform: States with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8% lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate compared with states without medical cannabis laws. Examination of the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality in each year after implementation of the law showed that such laws were associated with a lower rate of overdose mortality that generally strengthened over time. The data predates the legalization of recreational marijuana in any state, and therefore cannot test the relationship to full legalization — a distinction that Spicer did make in the press conference. It is unclear, however, if this distinction holds any relevance to the opioid epidemic. In January 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a comprehensive review of academic studies concerning cannabis use published since 1999. Importantly, they found no individual study or credible meta-review linking cannabis use to increased opioid use. While the concept of marijuana as a “gateway drug” remains controversial, there is a near-universal agreement that the opioid crisis was caused by an influx of legal prescription painkillers and is thus unrelated to marijuana use. Spicer A) would be therefore hard-pressed to find evidence to support his implied connection between recreational cannabis and opioid addiction, and B) would have to find a way to get around an increasing number of studies suggesting that less strict marijuana laws result in fewer opioid deaths.",unproven,"However, as noted in the the National Academies of Sciences review, the recent adoption of recreational marijuana laws and therefore the dearth of high quality studies make it impossible (at this time) to fully reject a connection between recreational pot and opioid addiction.","The claim states that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis in the United States. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer supported this claim by suggesting that there would likely be increased enforcement of recreational cannabis in the future due to the opioid crisis. However, the article argues that there is no evidence to support this claim and that studies actually suggest that cannabis legalization leads to a reduction in opioid overdoses.

The article highlights that the United States is indeed facing a serious crisis with opioid addiction and overdose. Drug overdose deaths, particularly those involving opioids, have been increasing. Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, have been a driving factor in the increase in opioid overdose deaths. The article also mentions that non-medical prescription drug use has been associated with illicit drug use, including heroin.

However, the article disputes the claim that recreational marijuana policies worsen the opioid crisis. It cites a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, which analyzed data from all states between 1999 and 2010. The study found that states with medical marijuana programs had lower opioid overdose mortality rates compared to states without such programs. The association between medical cannabis laws and lower overdose mortality rates strengthened over time. Although this study predates the legalization of recreational marijuana, it suggests that marijuana reform is associated with a decrease in opioid-related deaths.

Furthermore, the article mentions a comprehensive review released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017. This review found no individual study or credible meta-review linking cannabis use to increased opioid use. While the concept of marijuana as a ""gateway drug"" remains controversial, there is a consensus that the opioid crisis is unrelated to marijuana use and is primarily caused by legal prescription painkillers.

In conclusion, the article argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis. On the contrary, studies suggest that less strict marijuana laws result in fewer opioid deaths. The article challenges the implied connection between recreational cannabis and opioid addiction and highlights the need for evidence-based policies.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

God help any good people forced to live here … World leaders such as British politicians Nigel Farage and U.S. president Donald Trump have claimed that Sweden is now overrun with crime because the country took in about 193,000 asylum seekers in 2015 and 2016. However, most violence in Sweden can’t be linked to asylum seekers. Instead, economic stagnation in immigrant communities that formed decades ago has resulted in intergenerational poverty, which has in turn fueled the proliferation of street gangs. Data provided by Statistics Sweden show, for example, that unemployment is higher and education levels lower in Herrgården, which is thought of as the most dangerous part of Rosengård, a neighborhood in Malmö. The city of Malmö is often the subject of news reports about the supposed Swedish crime wave. Deputy Mayor Nils Karlsson told us that crime in these areas stems from Sweden’s failure to integrate previous generations of immigrants. Since the vast majority of the ethnically-Swedish population is college-educated, employers usually choose people with academic degrees over those without degrees, even for entry-level positions — in short, the same disparities that fuel crime all over the world: People with a background outside Europe have a much larger unemployment rate than people like me. In some areas of Malmö, the unemployment rate is 40 percent, while in other parts it’s about 1 percent. That is not a well-integrated society. If you’re growing up and your parents don’t have a job and don’t have much money, of course you’re not going to see that many alternatives for yourself. The key to stopping crime is getting people to work. The problem here is the level of education for the people coming here doesn’t match the job market anymore. Sweden’s governmental agency that conducts crime research, Brå, has not performed a study that takes into account the nationality of crime suspects since 2005, as the law currently prevents them from tracking the national origin of crime suspects and victims. In 2005, they found that people with non-Swedish backgrounds were 2.5 times more likely to be crime suspects, but Brå pointed to a Stockholm University finding that economic opportunity and social mobility play a decisive role in criminal activity: In the empirical analyses we follow all individuals who completed compulsory schooling during the period 1990 to 1993 in the Stockholm Metropolitan area (N=66,330), and we analyze how background factors related to the family of origin and neighborhood segregation during adolescence influence the gap in recorded crimes, which are measured in 2005. For males, we are generally able to explain between half and three-quarters of this gap in crime by parental socioeconomic resources and neighborhood segregation. For females, we can explain even more, sometimes the entire gap. Resources in the family of origin appear to be the strongest mediator. In addition, the residual differences are virtually unrelated to immigrants’ country of origin, indicating that ‘culture’ or other shared context-of-exit factors matter very little in generating the gap. (The term “context-of-exit” means the circumstances under which migrants left their home country). The experts we interviewed all noted that critics are conflating recently-arrived asylum seekers with other populations when they talk about “migrant crime.” Many of the persons committing crimes in areas such as Malmö or the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby are young people who were either born in Sweden to immigrant parents or were born outside the country but arrived in Sweden at a young age. Joakim Palmkvist, a long-time crime reporter for the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenskan, which is based in Malmö, explained that there is no massive new crime wave being perpetrated by newly-arrived refugees in Sweden’s suburbs — instead, crime today is an iteration of gang violence that has been going on in the country since the 1990s, starting with American exports such as the motorcycle gangs Hell’s Angels and Bandidos. Sitting in a small meeting area in Sydsvenskan‘s newsroom, Palmkvist explained that the motorcycle gangs were the “first wave” of gang organization in Sweden. They set the stage for the “second wave,” which to a large extent consisted of the children of people who fled the Balkan war. The current spate in violence in these areas is the result of a power vacuum in the organized crime community and the younger “third wave” — children of immigrants who have lived in Sweden most of their lives — who are now trying to establish themselves. What sets the so-called third wave apart from earlier waves is its chaotic nature, loose structure, and disconnection from wider society. The bar of what can spark a homicide is also lower than it has ever been; a wrong look or a leer at a girlfriend could lead to a shooting, Palmkvist said: The second wave, a couple have been killed off, trickled away, retired, some have gone to prison as well … The third wave is coming into that vacuum and they are fighting amongst each other to see who will be the main man. Crime researcher Johanna Olseryd pointed out that Brå’s annual crime survey showed that homicides aren’t increasing, but they are changing in nature: Less people are being victimized in the general population, but then we have a small group of people who are victimized repeatedly… Also when it comes to lethal violence, we haven’t seen an increase there but we have seen an increase in the proportion of cases that are perpetrated with guns. There’s been a change in the type of homicides that occur in Sweden — more guns and more homicides connected to a criminal milieu. We haven’t had an increase in total, but we can see the share of cases that have occurred with guns in these areas have increased. Police in Malmö are currently handling 14 homicides, a number that has overwhelmed local investigators, said Erik Jansåker, police chief for Malmö’s southern areas. One of the most rattling of the recent deaths was that of 16-year-old immigrant Ahmed Obaid, himself an immigrant. No one knows for certain why he was targeted in Rosengård while standing by a bus stop. A bouquet of yellow flowers still rested against a light pole at the bus stop on 16 March 2017, two months after his shooting. Officer Johannes Schultz, who patrols the neighborhood on foot, told us that Obaid’s shooting death sent a chill through the community: That changed the whole society in Rosengård. Even 17, 18 year-olds say they are afraid to go out when it’s dark now. Because he got shot and no one knows why. He was not a criminal. There have been less people out in the evenings than it was before that. But people tend to forget and it’s getting warmer, so it’s easier to be outside. Karlsson said that while the country’s crime is historically low he can understand the fear that the violence can engender, as when it does happen, it tends to be high profile: Despite us having taken in many immigrants during the 1990s when we had the Balkan crisis up to now, even with that immigration, the level of crimes have decreased. But Sweden is a small country and Malmö is a small city, and if someone gets shot many people will know that person. I can understand why people are scared. Yet, Karlsson, said, crime in Sweden has been alternately sensationalized and ignored. He told us that both liberals (who think of Sweden as a paradise) and conservatives (who say it is overrun with violence) have both gotten it wrong: Saying everything is great is not helping because you have to say there is a problem before you actually fix it. Sweden has been quite good at spreading the reputation about how perfect we are, which of course now backfires. But we used to have and still do have a low crime rate … since the early 1900s. Research from Brå backs him up — crime data show a general downward trend since 2005: In this graph from Sweden’s crime study, the dark solid line represents citizens who said they were victims of crime. The dotted line represents people who said someone in their household had been the victim of property crime, while the light solid line represents people who said they were victims of crimes on their person, a broad legal term that can mean anything from homicide to trespassing. Brå explained that overall, crime figures are trending down: The proportion of people who say they have been victim of any crime during the year have declined over the past decade, from 26 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2015. Primarily, the proportion of households who are victims of property crimes decreased, from 13 percent in 2006 to 10 percent 2015.",false,"The proportion exposed to one or several ‘crimes against person’ was 11 percent in 2005. Subsequently, the proportion gradually decreased, and then stabilized at a level of around 9 percent. The last three years the trend is not as clear. In 2013 there was a rise to 11 percent, which was supposed to be temporary because the following year showed a decline to 9 percent. In 2015, however, the proportion is again 11 percent. The year-to-year variations in recent years is therefore large.","The claim that recently-arrived asylum seekers are perpetrating the majority of crime in Sweden is not supported by the article. The article states that most violence in Sweden cannot be linked to asylum seekers.

The proportion of people who say they have been victims of any crime during the year has declined, as well as the proportion of households victimized by property crimes.

In conclusion, the article refutes the claim that recently-arrived asylum seekers are perpetrating the majority of crime in Sweden. It highlights the role of economic stagnation, intergenerational poverty, and gang violence in certain immigrant communities as the main factors contributing to crime in Sweden.","[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a helpful assistant that explains the veracity of a claim by considering the context.

The concept of medical tourism is well accepted in many countries, with at least one third of consumers in every country surveyed being open to the idea, except for Japan. Indians, Indonesians, Russians, Mexicans, and Poles were the most open to the idea of being medically mobile, with 31 percent or more people in each of those countries saying they would definitely consider traveling for medical or dental treatment.

The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment.

1212,1212,34562,The new supplement InteliGEN can boost brain function.,"Fueled by searing temperatures and high winds, more than 200 fires are burning across the southeastern states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, threatening several towns. The NSW state government declared a state of emergency, beginning on Friday, giving authorities the power to forcibly evacuate people and take control of services. “It is hell on earth. It is the worst anybody’s ever seen,” Michelle Roberts said by telephone from the Croajingolong Cafe she owns in Mallacoota, a southeastern coastal town where 4,000 residents and visitors have been stranded on the beach since Monday night. Roberts hoped to get her 18-year-old daughter onto a naval ship, which arrived off the town on Thursday, in order to escape the fires and thick smoke engulfing the town. The HMAS Choules is expected to make two or three voyages over the coming days, state authorities said. Elsewhere, long queues formed outside supermarkets and petrol stations as residents and tourists sought supplies to either bunker down or escape the fires, emptying shelves of staples like bread and milk. More than 50,000 people were without power and some towns had no access to drinking water. “Everyone’s just on edge,” said Shane Flanagan, a resident of Batemans Bay on the NSW coast. Authorities urged a mass exodus from several towns on the southeast coast, an area popular with tourists during the summer holiday season, warning that extreme heat forecast for the weekend will further stoke the fires. “The priority today is fighting fires and evacuating, getting people to safety,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Sydney. “There are parts of both Victoria and New South Wales which have been completely devastated, with a loss of power and communications.” Eight people have been killed by wildfires in NSW and Victoria since Monday and 18 are missing, officials said on Thursday. Temperatures are forecast to soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) along the south coast on Saturday, bringing the prospect of renewed firefronts to add to the around 200 current blazes. “It is going to be a very dangerous day. It’s going to be a very difficult day,” NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia: *Naval officials said they would open registration for evacuation on Thursday afternoon, with the HMAS Choules able to carry up to 1,000 people on the first trip. *”It’s 16-17 hours to the closest boat port, then we’ve got to come back,” HMAS Choules Commander Scott Houlihan said on Thursday afternoon. He said that leaving by boat was the only way out of the town. *Thousands of people had already been evacuated from the adjoining region of East Gippsland in Victoria, one of the largest such operations in the country since the northern city of Darwin evacuated over 35,000 people in the aftermath of cyclone Tracy in 1974. *Five military helicopters were en route to the south coast to back up firefighters and bring in supplies like water and diesel, the Australian Defence Force said. The aircraft will also be used to evacuate injured, elderly and young people. *A contingent of 39 firefighters from North America landed in Melbourne, bringing the number of U.S. and Canadian experts who have flown in to help deal with the crisis to almost 100. *Traffic on the main highway out of Batemans Bay on the NSW coast was bumper-to-bumper after authorities called for the town to be evacuated. Residents of the town reported there was no fuel, power or phone service, while supermarket shelves had been stripped bare of staples. *NSW’s Kosciuszko National Park, home to the Snowy Mountains, was closed and visitors were ordered to leave due to an extreme danger of fire. *Morrison urged those waiting for help and those stuck in traffic jams “to be patient ... help will arrive.” *Morrison, forced to defend his government’s limited action on climate change, blamed a three-year drought and lack of hazard reduction for the unprecedented extent and duration of this year’s bushfires. *Bushfires so far this season have razed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) of bushland and destroyed more than 1,000 homes, including 381 homes destroyed on the south coast this week.",unproven,"Tens of thousands of holiday makers fled seaside towns on Australia’s east coast on Thursday as bushfires approached, and military ships and helicopters began rescuing thousands more trapped by the blazes.","The article provided does not contain any information about the claim regarding the supplement InteliGEN and its ability to boost brain function.

The concept of medical tourism is well accepted in many countries, with at least one third of consumers in every country surveyed being open to the idea, except for Japan. Indians, Indonesians, Russians, Mexicans, and Poles were the most open to the idea of being medically mobile, with 31 percent or more people in each of those countries saying they would definitely consider traveling for medical or dental treatment. On the other hand, people in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Sweden were least likely to be medical tourists. The poll also revealed that younger adults under 35 years of age were more likely to consider medical tourism than people aged 50 to 64 years old. The most common types of treatments sought through medical tourism are dental care, cosmetic surgery, elective surgery, and fertility treatment. The medical tourist industry is influenced by various factors such as economic climate, domestic policy changes, political instability, travel restrictions, advertising practices, and innovative forms of treatment. Different studies have estimated that anywhere between 60,000 to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad for health care each year. The cost of travel, proximity, borders, and quality of care are factors that potential medical tourists consider. In Italy and Germany, about 20 percent of adults said they would definitely consider medical tourism, possibly due to their proximity to Hungary, a popular destination for health treatments.

The researchers found that occupational exposure to acrylic and nylon fibers, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, could increase the risk of breast cancer. However, some experts caution that these associations may occur by chance and that stronger evidence from other research is needed.\n\nThe study was conducted by Canadian scientists led by France Labreche from the Occupational Health Research Institute in Montreal. They analyzed data from over 1,100 women, 556 of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 75 after going through menopause. The researchers investigated the women's levels of exposure to around 300 different substances during their employment history.\n\nAfter accounting for other factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the analysis indicated a link between occupational exposure to certain substances and breast cancer. The risk was highest for exposures before the age of 36 and increased with each additional decade of exposure before this age. Women exposed to acrylic fibers had a seven-fold risk of breast cancer, while those exposed to nylon fibers had almost double the risk.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that their findings could be due to chance but also suggested that they were consistent with the theory that breast tissue is more sensitive to harmful chemicals when exposure occurs before a woman reaches her 40s.

The use of cholesterol lowering medicines of the “statin” class is widely regarded as the first-line therapy to prevent heart disease in patients with prior heart attacks or at increased risk of having one. However, many patients cannot tolerate statins due to side effects and while beneficial, these medicines do not entirely eliminate the risk. This study examined whether adding fenofibrate to a statin could reduce the risk of heart events more than just the statin alone. The results essentially confirm a previous report from these same researchers showing that in a subgroup of patients with high levels of fat in the blood (triglycerides) and low “good” (HDL) cholesterol levels, fenofibrate may have been beneficial. But the overall results of the original study were negative — something this release never touches upon.
