The tests were conducted between 2007 and 2009 by scientists from Egypt, Germany, and other countries. The results provide new insights into the life and death of King Tut.

54,54,54,9712,Penn study: Pay patients to take their pills,"A study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that paying patients and doctors cash incentives can significantly improve medication adherence. The study involved four patient groups, with the group that received incentives for both patients and doctors showing the greatest improvement in blood cholesterol levels. This group experienced a drop of 33.6 points in LDL cholesterol, compared to a drop of 25.1 points in the group that received no money. The study also used electronic pill bottles that sent a signal when opened, allowing researchers to monitor medication adherence. However, the article raises questions about the practicality and cost of implementing such a program. It highlights the need to analyze whether the amounts paid in the study, up to $1,024 over a year, would be worth it in terms of avoiding the costs of treating heart attacks and strokes. The article also mentions the potential limitations of the pay-for-taking-meds approach, such as patients potentially discontinuing medication after the payment stage. The story acknowledges the importance of quantifying the drops in cholesterol but suggests that it would be valuable to know if the incentives actually translated into increased medication adherence. It also discusses the downsides associated with the pay-for-taking-meds approach, including the side effects of the medications themselves. The article emphasizes that paying cash to patients to take medicine is an experimental idea and not something that local doctors are likely to offer. However, it could have provided more information on the prevalence and contexts in which this approach is being used. The story mentions that paying both patients and physicians to improve compliance is what makes this study novel, but it could have been clearer about other studies looking at patient financial incentives. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the study, including its methods, comparison, and limitations. It includes perspectives from researchers not involved in the study and a patient advocate in the field. The story is commended for addressing the cost trade-offs and providing important context.",true,"Researchers studied about 1,500 patients with blood cholesterol levels that put them at risk for heart disease and stroke to try to encourage them (via cash) to take their medicines – statins. Results were mixed, but the doctor-and-patient pairs who both received cash rewards showed the best results in lowering cholesterol levels. This story does an excellent job of explaining the study, providing great context on the underlying problems related to medication adherence, and quoting experts not involved in the study This is a lucid and well-rounded article on a very interesting topic. Solving behavioral issues that prevent patients from taking their medications is an important challenge. Even in this study, even with rewards, fewer than half the patients treated for high cholesterol levels kept taking their medication as prescribed. Many of the established Good Ideas in medicine (medications, etc) are stymied by downstream hurdles — doctors don’t prescribe the treatment as often as they should, patients don’t follow through, etc. Statins are a great example. It is really important to examine these gaps and design clever, cost-effective ways to close them.","A study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania found that paying patients and doctors cash incentives can significantly improve medication adherence.

The plan will outline the necessary actions for the government, businesses, and society to achieve significant emissions reductions across all forms of transport. It will also explore how technology can facilitate changes in transportation methods.

This commitment comes in the midst of protests by climate change activists, including members of Extinction Rebellion, who have been targeting Britain's transport ministry. One of their concerns is the proposed HS2 rail project, which they oppose due to its impact on ancient woodlands. However, the transport ministry argues that the rail line will reduce journey times and be more carbon-efficient than driving. In addition to the net zero emissions target, the government introduced an environment bill in parliament to establish legally binding targets for environmental protection and pollution reduction. The bill will also create an office for environment protection to hold the government accountable for progress towards the 2050 target. Experts highlight that achieving the net zero target will require significant changes in the energy, transport, heating, and buildings sectors.

The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected.

180,180,180,9355,"Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too","The article discusses a study that suggests maintaining healthy vision may also help keep the brain in shape. The study, funded by the National Eye Institute and the Jane Kroger Fund, involved over 2,500 individuals over a period of 8 years. The study used a cross-lagged analysis to examine the relationship between eyesight and cognitive function. The analysis found that the relationship between vision and cognition was stronger in the direction of vision to cognition, rather than the opposite. However, the correlations in both directions were modest. The article mentions that while there is evidence that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, its impact would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively. The article also mentions the high costs associated with maintaining visual capabilities in the United States, including diagnostic visits, expensive eyewear, and medical procedures for age-related problems like cataracts and macular degeneration. However, the article does not provide specific details about the costs of these options. It also does not provide a clear understanding of the strength of the link between vision and cognition. The article suggests that both cognitive decline and vision loss accompany aging, and exploring the relationship between the two would be beneficial. It mentions that other studies have also explored this relationship in recent years. The article implies that the vision treatments mentioned in the study, such as new eyeglass prescriptions or cataract surgery, are available in the marketplace. Overall, the article provides some details about the study, but leaves out important information such as the costs of vision-related options and the strength of the vision-cognition link. It also suggests that further research, including clinical trials, is needed to conclusively prove the impact of vision on cognitive health.",mixture,"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together. But does one cause the other? In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period. The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options. But such behavior awaits more robust studies, and stories about this link need to tread cautiously.","The article discusses a study that suggests maintaining healthy vision may also help keep the brain in shape. The study, funded by the National Eye Institute and the Jane Kroger Fund, involved over 2,500 individuals over a period of 8 years. The study used a cross-lagged analysis to examine the relationship between eyesight and cognitive function. The analysis found that the relationship between vision and cognition was stronger in the direction of vision to cognition, rather than the opposite. However, the correlations in both directions were modest. The article mentions that while there is evidence that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, its impact would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively.

The article also mentions the high costs associated with maintaining visual capabilities in the United States, including diagnostic visits, expensive eyewear, and medical procedures for age-related problems like cataracts and macular degeneration. However, the article does not provide specific details about the costs of these options. It also does not provide a clear understanding of the strength of the link between vision and cognition.

The article suggests that both cognitive decline and vision loss accompany aging, and exploring the relationship between the two would be beneficial. It mentions that other studies have also explored this relationship in recent years. The article implies that the vision treatments mentioned in the study, such as new eyeglass prescriptions or cataract surgery, are available in the marketplace.

Overall, the article provides some details about the study, but leaves out important information such as the costs of vision-related options and the strength of the vision-cognition link.

The claim veracity: mixture

### Response:
","
The claim that maintaining healthy vision may help keep the brain in shape is a mixture of truth and falsehood. The study cited in the article suggests that there is a correlation between vision and cognitive function, but the strength of the link is not clear. The article also mentions that vision treatments, such as new eyeglass prescriptions or cataract surgery, are available in the marketplace, but does not provide specific details about the costs of these options. Additionally, the article suggests that further research, including clinical trials, is needed to conclusively prove the impact of vision on cognitive health. Therefore, while there is some evidence that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, its impact would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively.

The NFA included measures such as gun buybacks, voluntary surrenders, and stricter gun owner licensing. A peer-reviewed study published in 2012 found that firearm homicides and suicides dropped significantly in the decade following the NFA.

The majority of victims are poisoned by the air in their own homes, as families burn whatever they can to keep warm during the harsh winters. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. The article highlights the case of a man named Yousuf, who lives in a camp for displaced people and burns garbage for warmth and cooking. His children have suffered from chest infections and other illnesses due to the pollution, and many have died before the age of seven. The camp lacks proper water and sanitation systems and is surrounded by garbage dumps. The government of Afghanistan has launched a program to control old vehicles, a significant source of pollution, and has called on residents to stop burning garbage for heat. However, fuel is expensive and often unavailable for many people in Kabul. Doctors at a children's hospital in Kabul have seen an increase in patients with pollution-related illnesses, particularly during the winter. The government has also launched an environmental awareness campaign to educate the public about the harm of pollution and steps to reduce it. However, there is a need for the state to take further action, such as encouraging tree planting and creating green spaces, as well as implementing a city master plan to address unplanned development and lack of services. The decades of war in Afghanistan have worsened the environmental damage and made it difficult to prioritize environmental issues.

361,361,361,3794,Trump backs Fla. plan to import lower-cost meds from abroad.,"President Trump has expressed support for a plan in Florida that would allow the importation of lower-cost prescription drugs from other countries. The move is seen as a confrontation between the Trump administration and the pharmaceutical industry, which has long fought against importation proposals. Trump made the announcement at a White House event where he pledged to end surprise medical bills for patients with health insurance coverage. He stated that states may be allowed to buy drugs from other countries if they can be purchased at a significantly lower price. The plan in Florida, which is expected to be signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, would require approval from the Department of Health and Human Services before implementation. The program would give Floridians access to cheaper Canadian prescription drugs, with supporters arguing that imported drugs would meet FDA standards and that a large percentage of drug ingredients used in the US are already foreign-made. The bill faced opposition from major pharmaceutical companies and medical organizations, who claimed that importing drugs would pose risks of counterfeit or ineffective substances and would be difficult to regulate. Some experts have expressed concerns about whether Canadian drugmakers have the capacity to supply the larger US market. However, consumer groups have strongly supported the idea, believing that it will pressure drugmakers to reduce prices. AARP, a leading advocacy group for older Americans, praised Trump for supporting the Florida legislation, stating that it would help reduce prescription drug costs. On the other hand, the pharmaceutical industry lobby, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, argued that the plan would put Floridians at risk and potentially allow counterfeit or adulterated medications.

468,468,468,10167,Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval,"The article discusses the FDA approval of a new anti-smoking drug called varenicline. The story mentions that the drug needs to be taken twice daily for a 12-week period, but it does not provide a cost comparison with existing treatments. The article does not embrace varenicline as a magic bullet and presents the numbers appropriately. However, it fails to provide a quantitative comparison of one-year abstinence rates with other drug and non-drug therapies. The article also does not mention any side effects of the drug, such as nausea, headaches, insomnia, and stomach problems, which were common in the varenicline group. The design of the varenicline trials is not discussed, making it difficult to assess the strength of the information. The numbers presented in the article are from two well-designed randomized, double-blind trials with a total of 2000 participants. The trials evaluated abstinence rates between varenicline, bupropion (Zyban), and placebo groups at 12 weeks, followed by continuous abstinence for another 40 weeks. The article does not show evidence of disease mongering, but it questions whether the 32 million people trying to quit smoking would need drug treatment. The prevalence rates of addicted smokers are provided by the Center for Disease Control. The data presented in the article is provided by Pfizer, the funder of the varenicline trials. Dr. Riggotti, an anti-smoking advocate, is cited in the article but is not affiliated with the varenicline study. The article suggests that another outside expert opinion would be appropriate if time allowed. The article briefly mentions other drug treatments with similar one-year abstinence rates, such as nicotine replacement therapies. However, it does not mention the behavioral component of treatment or that varenicline was compared with bupropion in the trials. The article acknowledges that there are multiple available therapies for long-term smoking cessation, and varenicline is just one option. The article mentions the recent FDA approval of varenicline but does not discuss when it will be available. The drug was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to its significant improvement over existing therapies. The article does not provide much discussion on how varenicline is different from nicotine itself, although it mentions that varenicline binds to the same receptor but is a partially active drug and does not bind to all nicotine receptor subtypes. There is no evidence that the story relies solely on a press release, as there are sources cited who are not affiliated with the studies or Pfizer.",mixture,"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher’s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories. That same night, the ABC and CBS network newscasts ran stories on the same topic, but their stories each ran only about 15 seconds and contained little information.)","The article discusses the FDA approval of a new anti-smoking drug called varenicline.

The study, conducted in Ontario, Canada, analyzed the medical records of over 200,000 seniors who had elective surgery between 1995 and 2008. It found that patients who took statins had a 16% reduced risk of renal failure and a 21% lower risk of dying after surgery compared to those who did not take the drugs. However, the article fails to mention the costs of statins, which are easily accessible, and the fact that in Canada, where the study was conducted, the costs of statins to the government should be quantifiable due to the universal healthcare system. The benefits of statins are presented in relative terms, which can be misleading to readers. The article provides absolute numbers, stating that out of 67,941 people, 1,208 suffered acute kidney injury without taking statins, while 1,039 suffered it while taking statins. This means that 169 fewer people suffered acute kidney injury while taking statins, assuming that statins had any effect. The article also fails to mention any risks or harms associated with statins, which is important when considering the potential extension of statin use to a larger population. The study design is briefly outlined in the article, mentioning that it analyzed the medical records of seniors who had elective surgery. However, the article does not discuss the limitations of the study, including the fact that the observed association between statin use and AKI may not be causal. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a ""statin user"" were simply filling a statin prescription in the previous 90 days, which may not be a strong enough basis to prove that statins protect kidneys from failing. The article also highlights the rise of AKI after surgery and its increased risk of patient death. However, it fails to provide a balanced perspective by stating that only about 2% of patients experience renal failure within two weeks of their procedures. The article also mentions that depending on how researchers define it, AKI may occur in up to 40% of patients, which can be confusing and alarming to readers. The article does not include any independent sources and does not discuss current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This may lead readers to believe that taking statins is the only way to prevent renal injury or death. While the article acknowledges that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals, it emphasizes the importance of showing this relationship in humans as well.

One of the risks associated with surgery is kidney failure, an outcome no patient or surgeon wants. To be able to reduce that risk by taking a pill would be a major boon to medicine. This study hints that statins could provide that benefit, but, as the authors themselves acknowledge, there are significant limitations to a backward-looking, uncontrolled study.

While the article acknowledges that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals, it emphasizes the importance of showing this relationship in humans as well. Overall, the article relies heavily on the study's abstract and lacks deeper context. It does not address the costs or risks of statins, fails to provide a balanced perspective on the risk of renal failure after surgery, and does not discuss alternative treatment approaches.
Claim: Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery
The claim veracity: false

### Response:

The article fails to mention the costs of statins, which are easily accessible, and the fact that in Canada, where the study was conducted, the costs of statins to the government should be quantifiable due to the universal healthcare system. The benefits of statins are presented in relative terms, which can be misleading to readers. The article provides absolute numbers, stating that out of 67,941 people, 1,208 suffered acute kidney injury without taking statins, while 1,039 suffered it while taking statins. This means that 169 fewer people suffered acute kidney injury while taking statins, assuming that statins had any effect. The article also fails to mention any risks or harms associated with statins, which is important when considering the potential extension of statin use to a larger population. The study design is briefly outlined in the article, mentioning that it analyzed the medical records of seniors who had elective surgery. However, the article does not discuss the limitations of the study, including the fact that the observed association between statin use and AKI may not be causal. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a ""statin user"" were simply filling a statin prescription in the previous 90 days, which may not be a strong enough basis to prove that statins protect kidneys from failing. The article also highlights the rise of AKI after surgery and its increased risk of patient death. However, it fails to provide a balanced perspective by stating that only about 2% of patients experience renal failure within two weeks of their procedures.

The study found that adalimumab, when added to the standard treatment, improved the symptoms of uveitis and extended the time between flare-ups from 13 weeks to 24 weeks. However, the article highlights some important information that was not mentioned in the study's release. It states that patients in the adalimumab group reported more serious adverse effects, such as respiratory tract infections and allergic reactions, compared to the placebo group. Additionally, 16% of patients in the adalimumab group dropped out of the study, compared to less than 7% in the placebo group. The article also notes that adalimumab had three times the rate of adverse events and twice as many serious adverse events compared to the placebo. The release of the study did not mention the word ""blindness,"" which is a possible outcome of untreated uveitis. The article praises the release for its transparency in disclosing potential conflicts of interest and directing readers to supplementary documents for more information. However, it criticizes the release for not providing enough information on how adalimumab compares to corticosteroids, which are commonly used to treat uveitis. The article explains that corticosteroids suppress the body's entire immune system, while adalimumab targets specific inflammation. The article concludes by stating that there is no cause for alarm in the study's findings.",true,"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.","The article discusses a study on the effectiveness of adalimumab (brand name Humira) as a treatment for chronic uveitis, a type of eye inflammation.

The ad claims that Reid voted against declaring English as the national language of the United States, twice. The article fact-checks this claim and provides evidence to support it.

In 2006, during a push for comprehensive immigration reform, Senator James Inhofe proposed an amendment to declare English as the national language of the United States. The amendment aimed to require all official government functions, including steps toward citizenship, to be conducted in English and establish that there is no entitlement to receive federal documents or services in languages other than English, unless required by law. Reid made an impassioned speech denouncing the bill as ""racist"" and ""divisive"" and voted against it. The amendment passed with the help of 11 Democrats.

In the same year, another amendment proposed by Senator Ken Salazar to declare English as the common and unifying language of the United States was passed, and Reid voted in favor of it. However, the immigration reform bill did not pass that year.

In 2007, during another attempt at comprehensive immigration reform, Inhofe proposed another amendment to declare English as the national language of the government of the United States. Reid voted against it, and the amendment passed.

The article concludes that Reid twice voted against amendments to declare English as the national language of the United States, even though he voted for an amendment to declare English as the common and unifying language of the United States. The claim made in the ad that Reid voted against declaring English as the national language is supported by his voting record and his vocal opposition to the bills.

The release states that the blood test is not ready for clinical use but hopes to be commercially available within the next five years. It mentions that the test correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries 94% of the time and that the levels of GFAP in the blood corresponded to the severity of the injuries. However, the release only focuses on the positive predictive value of the test and does not address the potential harms of false positives. The release also mentions the possibility of using the blood test to make brain injury diagnoses on the spot, but the study notes that GFAP is detectable in the bloodstream within one hour of injury, raising questions about the timing of the test. The release does not provide important aspects of the study, such as the fact that the study was conducted on 257 children, of which 152 received CT scans and 18 were found to have traumatic intracranial lesions. The release also notes that the lead author of the study receives funding from the NIH and is a scientific consultant for a company that has intellectual property rights to GFAP testing, which could be a potential conflict of interest. The release does not mention other research on biomarkers for concussion detection or the existing body of literature on GFAP and brain injury. The article criticizes the release for using hyperbole and not providing enough context or validation for the findings. It concludes by stating that further study is required to validate the findings before clinical application.",false,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.","The article discusses a press release about a study that claims concussions in children can be detected by a blood test.

The researchers discovered that intermittent fasting kick-starts the animals' metabolism and helps burn fat by generating body heat. However, the article criticizes the release for not providing important information such as the costs of the mice chow used in the study and the number of mice involved. It also points out that the release lacks specific details about the benefits of intermittent fasting, such as the amount of weight loss achieved by the fasting group compared to the control group. The release mentions that intermittent fasting has an impact on the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation, but it does not provide specific measurements or context for these changes. It also fails to mention any potential harms associated with intermittent fasting. The article highlights that the release does not acknowledge the limitations of the study or the fact that animal studies are rarely replicated in humans. The authors of the study called for further research to examine the long-term effects of intermittent fasting, potential harms, and whether the benefits apply to all generations and disease conditions. The release does not discuss current methods of obesity treatment or prevention, nor does it claim novelty in the field of intermittent fasting. The authors of the study acknowledge that others have already established the ability of intermittent fasting to promote weight loss, but they have identified a mechanism that explains why weight loss occurs in fasting mice. The article concludes by criticizing the headline of the release, which states ""On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity,"" as it may mislead readers into thinking the study was conducted on humans rather than mice. The release only clarifies this in the fourth sentence. Overall, the article highlights the lack of important information and context provided in the release, as well as the need for further research to fully understand the effects and potential harms of intermittent fasting.
Claim: On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity

755,755,755,840,U.N. flags need to cut meat to curb land use impact on global warming.,"The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report calling for significant changes to farming and eating habits in order to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on land and water resources. While the report does not explicitly advocate for going meat-free, it suggests that plant-based foods and sustainable animal-sourced food could free up millions of square kilometers of land by 2050 and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.7-8.0 gigatonnes per year. The report emphasizes that certain diets have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land. The IPCC warns that the window for making these changes is closing fast and that delaying emissions reductions will hinder the successful management of the climate change transition in the land sector. Land surface air temperature has risen by 1.53 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, causing heatwaves, droughts, heavy rain, land degradation, and desertification. Human use directly affects over 70% of the global land surface, and agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use activities are responsible for 23% of total net man-made greenhouse gas emissions, which rises to up to 37% when pre- and post-production activity in the food system is included. The report also highlights the environmental costs that should be factored into food production and warns of more disruption to global food chains due to climate change. It projects a median increase of 7.6% in cereal prices by 2050, leading to higher food prices and an increased risk of hunger. The report mentions that changing consumption habits have contributed to about 2 billion adults being overweight or obese, while an estimated 821 million people are undernourished. Additionally, 25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted. The report also addresses the impact of deforestation and desertification on global warming, noting that reducing deforestation and forest degradation could result in a significant reduction of CO2 emissions.

The vaccine, called BD584, was able to reduce chlamydial shedding by 95% in mice. However, the news release lacks important information and context. The release presents the study as if it were conducted in humans, but it fails to mention the potential costs and time required for testing and bringing the vaccine to market. It also does not provide any information about the number of mice studied, making it difficult to understand the significance of the 95% reduction in chlamydial shedding. One major omission in the release is the lack of information about any harms or adverse effects observed in the mice. The study itself discusses the details of how the work was conducted in mice, but the release does not mention this and gives the impression that the study was conducted in humans. The release also fails to mention that there is currently no other pharmacological treatment available for preventing chlamydia infection. It could have noted that public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases. Furthermore, the release does not mention that the vaccine is still far away from clinical application and may not even pass human trials. Instead, it focuses on how easy the vaccine would be to administer and how little training would be required. This overlooks the fact that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training. While the release claims novelty in the study, given the absence of any available chlamydia vaccines, it is misleading about the study cohort and fails to mention the true nature of the study. It is unclear if the investigators had the opportunity to review the release before it was published. In conclusion, the news release about the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia lacks important information and context. It presents the study as if it were conducted in humans, fails to mention potential costs and harms, and overlooks the fact that the vaccine is still far from clinical application.
Claim: Researchers produce first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia
The claim veracity: false

### Response:
","
The claim that researchers have produced the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia is false. The study conducted in mice only showed a 95% reduction in chlamydial shedding, but this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine is widely protective. Additionally, the study was conducted in mice, not humans, and it is not clear if the vaccine will be effective in humans. Furthermore, the study did not mention any potential harms or adverse effects, which is an important consideration for any vaccine. Finally, the news release failed to mention that there is currently no other pharmacological treatment available for preventing chlamydia infection, and that public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, the claim that researchers have produced the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia is false.

The proposal is supported by influential unions who are concerned about rising health care costs eating into employee compensation. However, health care providers argue that price controls would lead to doctors leaving the state, making it harder for people to access medical care, and could result in layoffs or closures of hospitals.

The CDC later updated its estimate for the 2017-18 season, noting that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987 deaths. As for the 2018-19 flu season, the number of deaths is still preliminary and will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available. The current estimate is about 34,157 deaths, which is less than half of what the Facebook post claims. The CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. They first look at in-hospital deaths and then use death certificate data since not all flu deaths occur in the hospital. The process of tallying flu deaths is challenging because many deaths due to flu may not be coded as such.

Obama stated that he had written a letter to Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in March 2007, warning them about the potential wave of foreclosures and urging them to convene a homeownership preservation summit. The article examines the context of the letter and whether it could have predicted the economic crisis of 2008. The letter, as quoted in the article, expresses concern about people losing their homes and calls for a summit to assess options for addressing the challenge. However, there is no indication in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008 or that he was warning about a systemic threat to the economic system. The article then looks at public statements made by Bernanke and Paulson around the time Obama sent his letter. Bernanke testified before Congress on March 28, 2007, acknowledging the financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage market but stating that the implications for the housing market as a whole were unclear. On May 15, 2007, Bernanke discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. On May 17, 2007, Bernanke mentioned that the Federal Reserve was considering steps to rein in subprime lending but did not expect significant spillovers to the rest of the economy. Paulson, on June 20, 2007, acknowledged a major housing correction but believed the market was at or near the bottom. The article concludes that Obama's letter did not have a significant impact, as Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells at the time. Economists interviewed for the article stated that it was too late by October 2008 to prevent the crisis, as the questionable loans and securities had already been issued. While Obama's letter addressed the problems faced by low-income homeowners, it was not an early warning of the economic collapse in 2008. In summary, the article confirms that Obama did write a letter to Paulson and Bernanke in March 2007, expressing concern about foreclosures.

The economists interviewed for the article also stated that it was too late by October 2008 to prevent the crisis, as the questionable loans and securities had already been issued.

1216,1216,1216,34442,Policies that legalize recreational marijuana exacerbate America’s opioid addiction epidemic.,"The claim states that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis in the United States. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer supported this claim by suggesting that there would likely be increased enforcement of recreational cannabis in the future due to the opioid crisis. However, the article argues that there is no evidence to support this claim and that studies actually suggest that cannabis legalization leads to a reduction in opioid overdoses. The article highlights that the United States is indeed facing a serious crisis with opioid addiction and overdose. Drug overdose deaths, particularly those involving opioids, have been increasing. Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, have been a driving factor in the increase in opioid overdose deaths. The article also mentions that non-medical prescription drug use has been associated with illicit drug use, including heroin. However, the article disputes the claim that recreational marijuana policies worsen the opioid crisis. It cites a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, which analyzed data from all states between 1999 and 2010. The study found that states with medical marijuana programs had lower opioid overdose mortality rates compared to states without such programs. The association between medical cannabis laws and lower overdose mortality rates strengthened over time. Although this study predates the legalization of recreational marijuana, it suggests that marijuana reform is associated with a decrease in opioid-related deaths. Furthermore, the article mentions a comprehensive review released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017. This review found no individual study or credible meta-review linking cannabis use to increased opioid use. While the concept of marijuana as a ""gateway drug"" remains controversial, there is a consensus that the opioid crisis is unrelated to marijuana use and is primarily caused by legal prescription painkillers. In conclusion, the article argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis.

While some studies have suggested that marijuana use may be associated with an increased risk of opioid use, other studies have found no such link. Additionally, the article cites a study that found that states with medical marijuana programs had lower opioid overdose mortality rates compared to states without such programs. This suggests that less strict marijuana laws may actually result in fewer opioid deaths. Furthermore, the comprehensive review released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017 found no individual study or credible meta-review linking cannabis use to increased opioid use.
