122,122,2152,"The article discusses the results of genetic and radiological testing performed on the mummies of King Tutankhamen and other members of his family. The tests were conducted between 2007 and 2009 by scientists from Egypt, Germany, and other countries. The results provide new insights into the life and death of King Tut.

The testing revealed that King Tut had contracted a severe form of malaria, which likely contributed to his death. This finding rules out the possibility of murder or another sickness as the cause of his death. The scientists also speculate that Tut was weakened by a broken leg, possibly from a fall. In addition to malaria and the broken leg, Tut had other health issues, including a cleft palate, mild clubfoot in his left foot, and other bone ailments. He and some family members also had a form of Kohler disease, which can cause foot bones to collapse but is not fatal.

The scientists believe that Tutankhamen had multiple disorders that may have weakened his immune system. They describe him as a young but frail king who needed canes to walk. In Tut's tomb, along with priceless gold artifacts, around 130 canes and staves were found, some of which showed signs of wear. This suggests that Tut relied on these walking aids.

The study also identified the mummies belonging to Tut's father, Akhenaten, and his grandmother, Tiye, based on shared blood groups. The scientists debunked speculation that Tut and his ancestors had severe abnormalities, ruling out conditions like Marfan syndrome and another condition that could have led to enlarged breasts. They explain that ancient Egyptian kings were typically represented in an idealized fashion, so it is unlikely that Tut or Akhenaten had significantly bizarre or feminine physiques.

Overall, the study provides important information about the 18th Dynasty, which lasted for 155 years and included Tutankhamen.

125,125,10484,"The article discusses a controversial surgical procedure called the ""liberation procedure"" that is being used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The procedure involves opening up blocked veins in the neck and chest to improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms of MS.

The costs of the procedure are said to run into the tens of thousands of dollars or more.

",mixture,"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected. The problem is that in the desperate search for a cure, patients, family and providers can seek out risky and expensive treatments that haven’t been adequately studied.",Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment
132,132,10461,"Researchers at the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster have developed the first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia, according to a news release. The vaccine, called BD584, was able to reduce chlamydial shedding by 95% in mice. However, the news release lacks important information and context.

The release presents the study as if it were conducted in humans, but it fails to mention the potential costs and time required for testing and bringing the vaccine to market. It also does not provide any information about the number of mice studied, making it difficult to understand the significance of the 95% reduction in chlamydial shedding.

One major omission in the release is the lack of information about any harms or adverse effects observed in the mice. The study itself discusses the details of how the work was conducted in mice, but the release does not mention this and gives the impression that the study was conducted in humans.

The release also fails to mention that there is currently no other pharmacological treatment available for preventing chlamydia infection. It could have noted that public health experts recommend condoms for preventing this and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Furthermore, the release does not mention that the vaccine is still far away from clinical application and may not even pass human trials. Instead, it focuses on how easy the vaccine would be to administer and how little training would be required. This overlooks the fact that administering nasal doses to mice would require some training.

While the release claims novelty in the study, given the absence of any available chlamydia vaccines, it is misleading about the study cohort and fails to mention the true nature of the study. It is unclear if the investigators had the opportunity to review the release before it was published.

This commitment makes Britain the first G7 country to adopt such a target for 2050. The plan will outline the necessary actions for the government, businesses, and society to achieve significant emissions reductions across all forms of transport. It will also explore how technology can facilitate changes in transportation methods.

Transport Secretary Grant Schapps emphasized the importance of ensuring that transport is as environmentally friendly as possible, from driving cars to taking flights. This commitment comes in the midst of protests by climate change activists, including members of Extinction Rebellion, who have been targeting Britain's transport ministry. One of their concerns is the proposed HS2 rail project, which they oppose due to its impact on ancient woodlands. However, the transport ministry argues that the rail line will reduce journey times and be more carbon-efficient than driving.

In addition to the net zero emissions target, the government introduced an environment bill in parliament to establish legally binding targets for environmental protection and pollution reduction. The bill will also create an office for environment protection to hold the government accountable for progress towards the 2050 target.

Experts highlight that achieving the net zero target will require significant changes in the energy, transport, heating, and buildings sectors.

183,183,1535,"The ceremony harkens back to a time when early Chinese settlers to Taiwan used to pray to mountain gods and local deities for protection against wild animals and other threats. Each new year, the fattened pigs are slaughtered and the carcasses decorated and paraded through the streets of Sanxia, a traditional district in northern Taiwan, to the temple. The owner of the biggest pig wins the competition and with it an auspicious sign that the year to come will be a lucky one. “This is a custom at our Tzu Shih Yeh (founder ancestor) temple in Sanxia. We cannot abolish this tradition,” said Liu Ching-sheng, owner of this year’s winning pig.

The owner of the biggest pig wins the competition and with it an auspicious sign that the year to come will be a lucky one. “This is a custom at our Tzu Shih Yeh (founder ancestor) temple in Sanxia. We cannot abolish this tradition,” said Liu Ching-sheng, owner of this year’s winning pig.

Claim: On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity

### Response:
",FALSE,"This news release describes a study about intermittent fasting in mice, in which the mice that fasted weighed less four months later than the mice that did not fast. The finding described in the news release only applied to mice being fed a high fat diet (45 percent from fat), whereas when on normal chow and intermittent fasting on normal chow, there wasn’t much difference. The release was short on numbers and descriptions of measurements used, and implied that the mouse studies could benefit people, without any caveats that such a transfer of mouse discovery to practical application in humans often fails. The release did name the funders and avoided sensationalizing obesity. Obesity is an enormous public health problem. But this release misleads the reader into thinking its conclusions will transfer from the mice in the study to human patients with obesity. We were disappointed by this quote from one of the researchers: “Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,” says Kyoung-Han Kim.” Based on the published study, we don’t find any evidence that this has been proven for human patients. A more accurate quote would be, “Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders in mice being fed a high fat diet.”",On-and-off fasting helps fight obesity
297,297,23732,"The article examines two claims made by Republican strategist Ed Gillespie regarding the economic performance under President George W. Bush. Gillespie claimed that there were 52 months of uninterrupted job creation and that revenues were at an all-time high in 2007. 

Regarding the claim of uninterrupted job creation, the Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the economy added more jobs than it lost during 50 out of 52 months between September 2003 and December 2007. However, there were two months during that period where jobs were lost. Therefore, Gillespie's claim of uninterrupted job creation is slightly inaccurate. It should be noted that over the course of Bush's presidency, the economy created 1.08 million jobs, which is the lowest average annual percentage increase compared to other post-World War II presidents prior to Obama.

Regarding the claim of all-time high revenues in 2007, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center confirms that total federal tax receipts reached $2.57 trillion in 2007, the highest recorded since 1934. However, this statistic neglects the size of the economy as a whole. When considering the size of the economy, tax revenues represented 18.5 percent of GDP in 2007, which is high but not a record.

450,450,29354,"The article debunks the claim that three additives in peanut butter cups, soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ, are inherently dangerous and should be avoided. It explains that the claim is misleading and factually impoverished. 

Regarding soy lecithin, the article states that it is a naturally occurring mixture of organic compounds and is added to foods to improve texture and aid in mixing. The claim that soy lecithin has detrimental effects on fertility, causes behavioral and cerebral abnormalities, and is linked to breast cancer is based on a study that used extremely high doses of soy lecithin on pregnant laboratory rats. The amount of soy lecithin used in the study is much higher than what humans would consume, even on a daily basis. The FDA considers lecithin and lecithin bleached with hydrogen peroxide to be safe for consumption.

Regarding PGPR, the article explains that it is a common additive used to improve texture and volume in bakery products, salad dressings, and chocolate. The claim that PGPR is connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children is a misrepresentation of its risk, which is negligible. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has reaffirmed the safety of PGPR.

Regarding TBHQ, the article acknowledges that it is a petroleum derivative but states that it is a specific, isolated, and modified chemical. While there have been animal studies reporting harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses allowed by regulatory agencies are settled. The EFSA has found that TBHQ is not carcinogenic and further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary. The claim that children exposed to TBHQ may show anxiety, restlessness, and intensified ADHD symptoms is not supported by peer-reviewed studies specifically linking TBHQ to these conditions.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ in peanut butter cups are inherently dangerous. It explains that the claims made about these additives are either misleading or based on unrealistic doses used in studies. Regulatory agencies have deemed these additives safe for consumption.",FALSE,"A popular post on social media lists three additives in peanut butter cups as dangerous and should be avoided. The post is misleading and factually impoverished. Soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ are all deemed safe by regulatory agencies.","### Context: The article debunks the claim that three additives in peanut butter cups, soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ, are inherently dangerous and should be avoided. It explains that the claim is misleading and factually impoverished. 

Regarding soy lecithin, the article states that it is a naturally occurring mixture of organic compounds and is added to foods to improve texture and aid in mixing. The claim that soy lecithin has detrimental effects on fertility, causes behavioral and cerebral abnormalities, and is linked to breast cancer is based on a study that used extremely high doses of soy lecithin on pregnant laboratory rats. The amount of soy lecithin used in the study is much higher than what humans would consume, even on a daily basis. The FDA considers lecithin and lecithin bleached with hydrogen peroxide to be safe for consumption.

Regarding PGPR, the article explains that it is a common additive used to improve texture and volume in bakery products, salad dressings, and chocolate. The claim that PGPR is connected to gastrointestinal problems and allergic reactions in children is a misrepresentation of its risk, which is negligible. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has reaffirmed the safety of PGPR.

Regarding TBHQ, the article acknowledges that it is a petroleum derivative but states that it is a specific, isolated, and modified chemical. While there have been animal studies reporting harmful effects after extremely large doses of TBHQ, the long-term effects of humans exposed to it in doses allowed by regulatory agencies are settled. The EFSA has found that TBHQ is not carcinogenic and further genotoxicity studies are unnecessary. The claim that children exposed to TBHQ may show anxiety, restlessness, and intensified ADHD symptoms is not supported by peer-reviewed studies specifically linking TBHQ to these conditions.

In conclusion, the article debunks the claim that soy lecithin, PGPR, and TBHQ in peanut butter cups are inherently dangerous. It explains that the claims made about these additives are either misleading or based on unrealistic doses used in studies. Regulatory agencies have deemed these additives safe for consumption.

The figure of 80,000 was a preliminary estimate provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the 2017-18 flu season. However, the final figure for that year was lower, estimated to be around 61,000 deaths. The CDC later updated its estimate for the 2017-18 season, noting that the true range could be as low as 46,404 and as high as 94,987 deaths.

As for the 2018-19 flu season, the number of deaths is still preliminary and will be updated at a later date when data on contemporary testing practices become available. The current estimate is about 34,157 deaths, which is less than half of what the Facebook post claims.

The CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the numbers of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States each year. They first look at in-hospital deaths and then use death certificate data since not all flu deaths occur in the hospital. The process of tallying flu deaths is challenging because many deaths due to flu may not be coded as such.

476,476,34442,"The claim states that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis in the United States. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer supported this claim by suggesting that there would likely be increased enforcement of recreational cannabis in the future due to the opioid crisis. However, the article argues that there is no evidence to support this claim and that studies actually suggest that cannabis legalization leads to a reduction in opioid overdoses.

The article highlights that the United States is indeed facing a serious crisis with opioid addiction and overdose. Drug overdose deaths, particularly those involving opioids, have been increasing. Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, have been a driving factor in the increase in opioid overdose deaths. The article also mentions that non-medical prescription drug use has been associated with illicit drug use, including heroin.

However, the article disputes the claim that recreational marijuana policies worsen the opioid crisis. It cites a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014, which analyzed data from all states between 1999 and 2010. The study found that states with medical marijuana programs had lower opioid overdose mortality rates compared to states without such programs. The association between medical cannabis laws and lower overdose mortality rates strengthened over time. Although this study predates the legalization of recreational marijuana, it suggests that marijuana reform is associated with a decrease in opioid-related deaths.

Furthermore, the article mentions a comprehensive review released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2017. This review found no individual study or credible meta-review linking cannabis use to increased opioid use. While the concept of marijuana as a ""gateway drug"" remains controversial, there is a consensus that the opioid crisis is unrelated to marijuana use and is primarily caused by legal prescription painkillers.

In conclusion, the article argues that there is no evidence to support the claim that policies legalizing recreational marijuana worsen the opioid addiction crisis.

The machine costs around $300,000, but Medicare does not specifically cover its use. Some private insurers, like Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield, also decline to cover it due to the lack of scientific evidence of its effectiveness in improving health outcomes.

The article mentions that the NanoKnife has some reported side effects, such as triggering fast heartbeats and the possibility of puncturing an artery during the operation. However, the company behind the NanoKnife claims that these side effects have been treatable and that they have taken steps to minimize future occurrences.

The story highlights the lack of evidence for the benefits of the NanoKnife due to the limited number of human patients it has been tested on. It questions why the company thinks the results are promising and does not provide a comparison with other traditional surgical approaches for treating cancer.

607,607,24862,"The article discusses a claim made by Barack Obama during a presidential debate in 2008. Obama stated that he had written a letter to Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke in March 2007, warning them about the potential wave of foreclosures and urging them to convene a homeownership preservation summit. The article examines the context of the letter and whether it could have predicted the economic crisis of 2008.

The letter, as quoted in the article, expresses concern about people losing their homes and calls for a summit to assess options for addressing the challenge. However, there is no indication in the letter that Obama had early insights into the events that would unfold in 2008 or that he was warning about a systemic threat to the economic system.

The article then looks at public statements made by Bernanke and Paulson around the time Obama sent his letter. Bernanke testified before Congress on March 28, 2007, acknowledging the financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage market but stating that the implications for the housing market as a whole were unclear. On May 15, 2007, Bernanke discouraged new regulation of derivatives, which played a role in the credit crisis of 2008. On May 17, 2007, Bernanke mentioned that the Federal Reserve was considering steps to rein in subprime lending but did not expect significant spillovers to the rest of the economy. Paulson, on June 20, 2007, acknowledged a major housing correction but believed the market was at or near the bottom.

The article concludes that Obama's letter did not have a significant impact, as Bernanke and Paulson were not sounding alarm bells at the time. Economists interviewed for the article stated that it was too late by October 2008 to prevent the crisis, as the questionable loans and securities had already been issued. While Obama's letter addressed the problems faced by low-income homeowners, it was not an early warning of the economic collapse in 2008.

On the other hand, the pharmaceutical industry lobby, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, argued that the plan would put Floridians at risk and potentially allow counterfeit or adulterated medications. They claimed that there is no evidence that the plan would save patients money or guarantee their safety.

Claim: Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval

### Response:",mixture,"This is an evening network newscast story on the recent FDA approval of the drug varenicline (trade name Chantix) for smoking cessation. Given the time constraints of this news story, the reporters do an excellent job of even-handedly presenting the new drug in the context of other therapies for smoking cessation. Varenicline may be an option for those who have not been able to quit smoking using other drug treatments, such as the anti-depressant bupropion (trade name Zyban) or nicotine replacement therapy. Varenicline was given priority status and fast-tracked for approval due to the “significant improvement” over existing therapies for smoking cessation; however, the long-term benefit of varenicline over exiting therapies is not very significant. Approval of varenicline was largely based on two double-blind, randomized studies of 2000 smokers in which the drug was compared with bupropion (trade name Zyban) and a placebo. The studies were both funded by Pfizer, maker of varenicline. The news story presents longer-term (1 year) abstinence rates, which are important for evaluating smoking cessation therapies. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of side effects. Nausea, headaches, insomnia and other stomach problems were more common in the varenicline group, but none of these are mentioned in the broadcast. The cost of a 12-week course of varenicline is provided in context with a message that smoking is a strong addiction and that reliance on a pill alone may not be enough. There is a behavioral component to smoking cessation that is recognized even by Pfizer, which, in the press release announcing approval of varenicline for smoking cessation, also announces plans to offer varenicline users an interactive on-line support program. (Publisher’s Note: Although this review points out some flaws, this NBC story is to be applauded for what it achieved in the usual limited time afforded TV news stories. That same night, the ABC and CBS network newscasts ran stories on the same topic, but their stories each ran only about 15 seconds and contained little information.)",Anti-smoking drug receives FDA approval

The tax in question is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, which Republicans argue would be passed on to consumers.

Furthermore, the claim that the cap-and-trade program would pay for nationalized health care is also false.

Claim: Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test

### Response:",FALSE,"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.",Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test

Clinton has a history of campaign backing from the finance industry and delivering high-priced speeches to finance firms, such as Goldman Sachs. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, a deregulation that some critics believe contributed to the financial crisis. 

During her ill-fated presidential primary campaign in 2007, Clinton addressed the nascent issues of the financial crisis, particularly the mortgage crisis. She gave speeches on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market and proposed specific solutions, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, safeguards against predatory lending practices, and policies to prevent foreclosures. In September 2007, Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies. 

In November 2007, Clinton mentioned derivatives for the first time in a speech in Iowa. She emphasized the need to address the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products. She also called for more oversight of financial markets. In March 2008, before the financial crisis hit its peak, Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation, which included more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards, and strengthened consumer protections. 

After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. However, it is clear that addressing the financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008.

She gave speeches on the volatility of the subprime mortgage market and proposed specific solutions, including expanding the role of the Federal Housing Administration, more borrowing options for underprivileged and first-time homebuyers, safeguards against predatory lending practices, and policies to prevent foreclosures. In September 2007, Clinton sponsored a bill to implement these policies. 

In November 2007, Clinton mentioned derivatives for the first time in a speech in Iowa. She emphasized the need to address the risks posed by derivatives and other complex financial products. She also called for more oversight of financial markets. In March 2008, before the financial crisis hit its peak, Clinton released a six-point plan to increase financial regulation, which included more oversight of derivatives and other new financial products, establishment of mortgage standards, and strengthened consumer protections. 

After becoming secretary of state in 2009, Clinton made fewer comments on domestic policy and financial regulation. However, it is clear that addressing the financial crisis was a key point of her campaign platform in 2007 and 2008. 

Overall, Clinton's statement that she ""called for addressing risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight"" early on in the financial crisis is accurate.

849,849,11043,"The article titled ""Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery"" discusses a study that suggests statin medications may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after surgery. The study, conducted in Ontario, Canada, analyzed the medical records of over 200,000 seniors who had elective surgery between 1995 and 2008. It found that patients who took statins had a 16% reduced risk of renal failure and a 21% lower risk of dying after surgery compared to those who did not take the drugs.

However, the article fails to mention the costs of statins, which are easily accessible, and the fact that in Canada, where the study was conducted, the costs of statins to the government should be quantifiable due to the universal healthcare system. The benefits of statins are presented in relative terms, which can be misleading to readers. The article provides absolute numbers, stating that out of 67,941 people, 1,208 suffered acute kidney injury without taking statins, while 1,039 suffered it while taking statins. This means that 169 fewer people suffered acute kidney injury while taking statins, assuming that statins had any effect. The article also fails to mention any risks or harms associated with statins, which is important when considering the potential extension of statin use to a larger population.

The study design is briefly outlined in the article, mentioning that it analyzed the medical records of seniors who had elective surgery. However, the article does not discuss the limitations of the study, including the fact that the observed association between statin use and AKI may not be causal. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a ""statin user"" were simply filling a statin prescription in the previous 90 days, which may not be a strong enough basis to prove that statins protect kidneys from failing.

The article also highlights the rise of AKI after surgery and its increased risk of patient death. However, it fails to provide a balanced perspective by stating that only about 2% of patients experience renal failure within two weeks of their procedures. The article also mentions that depending on how researchers define it, AKI may occur in up to 40% of patients, which can be confusing and alarming to readers.

The article does not include any independent sources and does not discuss current treatment approaches for reducing the risk of renal failure. This may lead readers to believe that taking statins is the only way to prevent renal injury or death. While the article acknowledges that the connection between statin use and renal protection has only been seen in animals, it emphasizes the importance of showing this relationship in humans as well.

Claim: Statin Drugs May Cut Risk of Kidney Trouble After Surgery

### Response:",FALSE,"The story could have benefited from some strong, independent voices commenting on the findings and from a more careful explanation of the study itself. Readers deserved to know more about the study’s limitations, about the absolute differences seen in the groups studied and about the risks associated with statin use.

One of the risks associated with surgery is kidney failure, an outcome no patient or surgeon wants. To be able to reduce that risk by taking a pill would be a major boon to medicine. This study hints that statins could provide that benefit, but, as the authors themselves acknowledge, there are significant limitations to a backward-looking, uncontrolled study.

The author examines examples of lawmakers who receive farm subsidies and their stance on SNAP. 

One example is Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, who supports cuts to the food stamp program but is also one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies. Fincher and his wife collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012, with $70,000 in direct payments in 2012 alone. During the debate on cutting SNAP, Fincher argued that the government should not continuously print money and that it is other people's money being spent.

Another example is Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California, who owns one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which received $188,570 in direct farm payments in 2012. Since 1995, the partnership has received $5.13 million in subsidies. LaMalfa won an amendment that would require fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He believes the success of the food stamp program should be measured by self-sufficiency rather than the number of people on the rolls.

Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997. He recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, stating that the program has outgrown its original mission. 

The article also mentions that 15 members of Congress received farm subsidies in 2012, with 13 being Republicans and 2 being Democrats.

The author examines examples of lawmakers who receive farm subsidies and their stance on SNAP. 

One example is Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, who supports cuts to the food stamp program but is also one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies. Fincher and his wife collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012, with $70,000 in direct payments in 2012 alone. During the debate on cutting SNAP, Fincher argued that the government should not continuously print money and that it is other people's money being spent.

985,985,15218,"Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush claimed that Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues."" This claim was made during a town hall event in Englewood, Colorado, where an audience member asked Bush about his record on women’s health and what he would do for women’s health, particularly for veterans, if elected president. Bush responded by stating that he does not believe Planned Parenthood should receive any funding because they are not involved in women’s health issues.

Planned Parenthood is a controversial organization that provides a range of reproductive health services, including contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services, and cancer screenings such as breast exams. While they do provide abortion services, which Bush opposes, the majority of their services are related to women’s health.

According to the National Library of Medicine, women’s health encompasses the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being. Planned Parenthood's primary focus is reproductive health, which is a significant aspect of women’s health. In 2013, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients and provided nearly 11 million services. Only 12 percent of patients received an abortion, meaning the remaining 88 percent received other health services.

Fact-checkers at the Washington Post's Fact Checker gave Bush's claim four Pinocchios, their lowest rating. They pointed out that Planned Parenthood offers a wide range of services that are directly related to women’s health, such as contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests, and STI testing and treatment. While Bush opposes abortion, it is inaccurate to claim that Planned Parenthood is not addressing women’s health issues.

In response to criticism from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, Bush tweeted that Planned Parenthood's treatment of the unborn has been horrifying and suggested supporting quality women's health programs instead. However, this does not negate the fact that Planned Parenthood provides essential services for women's health.

In conclusion, Jeb Bush's claim that Planned Parenthood is ""not actually doing women’s health issues"" is contradicted by the organization's provision of over 10 million services in 2013, including various aspects of women's health.

1001,1001,1851,"According to a study published in the American Journal of Medicine, alternative therapies such as acupuncture and hypnosis can be effective options for smokers who want to quit. The researchers, led by Mehdi Tahiri of McGill University, stated that while there are still questions about the effectiveness of these therapies compared to conventional methods, they should be recommended as choices for smokers who are not interested in medication or have not had success with standard therapies.

The study found that smokers who underwent acupuncture were more than three times as likely to be tobacco-free six months to a year later. Similarly, smokers who received hypnosis had a higher success rate compared to those who had minimal help. However, the success rate was not consistent across all tests conducted, although the overall trends pointed to the benefits of alternative treatment.

One study in 2008 showed that 55 percent of smokers who received laser acupuncture quit smoking in six months, compared to only four percent of those who did not receive the treatment. However, a 2007 study from Taiwan reported a lower success rate for needle acupuncture around the ear, with only nine percent of participants quitting after six months compared to six percent without the treatment. The situation was similar for hypnosis, with two studies showing a significant impact and 20 to 45 percent of patients being smoke-free six months to a year later, while the other two trials showed smaller effects.

The article states that most violence in Sweden cannot be linked to asylum seekers.

Unemployment is higher and education levels lower in certain neighborhoods, such as Herrgården in Malmö, which is considered the most dangerous part of Rosengård. The article emphasizes that crime in these areas stems from Sweden's failure to integrate previous generations of immigrants.

The article also highlights that crime in Sweden is not a result of recently-arrived refugees, but rather an iteration of gang violence that has been ongoing since the 1990s. Motorcycle gangs like Hell's Angels and Bandidos were the first wave of gang organization in Sweden, followed by the children of people who fled the Balkan war. The current violence in these areas is attributed to a power vacuum in the organized crime community and the younger ""third wave"" of children of immigrants who are trying to establish themselves. This third wave is characterized by its chaotic nature, loose structure, and disconnection from wider society.

However, the 2005 study found that people with non-Swedish backgrounds were 2.5 times more likely to be crime suspects.

Claim: Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation

### Response:",TRUE,"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.","Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation"

The post gained significant attention and was shared over half a million times. Higgins confirmed that she is the true author of the post and is currently living in Italy.

The claims made by Higgins in her post are generally accurate. She emphasized that COVID-19 is more lethal than the seasonal flu, with a mortality rate of about 3% compared to 0.1% for the flu. Italy has implemented strict measures to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, closures of nonessential businesses, and social distancing. The country's healthcare system is overwhelmed, with over 80% of hospital beds in the hardest-hit province occupied by COVID-19 patients. Doctors are struggling to meet patients' needs and are even rationing care.

The claims made by Higgins in her post are generally accurate. She emphasized that COVID-19 is more lethal than the seasonal flu, with a mortality rate of about 3% compared to 0.1% for the flu. Italy has implemented strict measures to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, closures of nonessential businesses, and social distancing. The country's healthcare system is overwhelmed, with over 80% of hospital beds in the hardest-hit province occupied by COVID-19 patients. Doctors are struggling to meet patients' needs and are even rationing care.

1173,1173,840,"The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report calling for significant changes to farming and eating habits in order to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on land and water resources. While the report does not explicitly advocate for going meat-free, it suggests that plant-based foods and sustainable animal-sourced food could free up millions of square kilometers of land by 2050 and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.7-8.0 gigatonnes per year. The report emphasizes that certain diets have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land.

The IPCC warns that the window for making these changes is closing fast and that delaying emissions reductions will hinder the successful management of the climate change transition in the land sector. Land surface air temperature has risen by 1.53 degrees Celsius since the pre-industrial era, causing heatwaves, droughts, heavy rain, land degradation, and desertification. Human use directly affects over 70% of the global land surface, and agriculture accounts for 70% of freshwater use.

Agriculture, forestry, and other land use activities are responsible for 23% of total net man-made greenhouse gas emissions, which rises to up to 37% when pre- and post-production activity in the food system is included. The report also highlights the environmental costs that should be factored into food production and warns of more disruption to global food chains due to climate change. It projects a median increase of 7.6% in cereal prices by 2050, leading to higher food prices and an increased risk of hunger.

The report mentions that changing consumption habits have contributed to about 2 billion adults being overweight or obese, while an estimated 821 million people are undernourished. Additionally, 25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted. The report also addresses the impact of deforestation and desertification on global warming, noting that reducing deforestation and forest degradation could result in a significant reduction of CO2 emissions.

The report does not directly mention the Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the ""lungs of the world,"" but Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro's support for opening up protected areas of the rainforest for agriculture and mining is a concern. The report, prepared by over 100 scientists, must be approved by governments, and during discussions, Brazil and India were active in protecting their national agro-industrial interests.",TRUE,"Cutting down on red meat, especially beef, is one of a range of changes needed to reduce the impact of land use on global warming, a draft United Nations report says.","### Context: The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has released a report calling for significant changes to farming and eating habits in order to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on land and water resources.

The analysis found that the relationship between vision and cognition was stronger in the direction of vision to cognition, rather than the opposite. However, the correlations in both directions were modest. The article mentions that while there is evidence that vision could be a factor in cognitive health, its impact would still need to be tested in a clinical trial to be proven conclusively.

Claim: Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too

### Response:",mixture,"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together. But does one cause the other? In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period. The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options. But such behavior awaits more robust studies, and stories about this link need to tread cautiously.","Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too"
